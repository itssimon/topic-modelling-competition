1,strange feelings was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being to be base and vicious as many on record have been appeared the lowest degradation a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm for a long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow or even why there were laws and governments but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the arabian the strange system of human society was explained to me i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood the words induced me to turn towards myself i learned that the possessions most
2,esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches a man might be respected with only one of these advantages but without either he was considered except in very rare instances as a vagabond and a slave doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few and what was i of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant but i knew that i possessed no money no friends no kind of property i was besides endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome i was not even of the same nature as man i was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet i bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame my stature far exceeded theirs when i looked around i saw and heard of none like me was i then a monster a blot upon the earth from which all men fled and whom all men disowned i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me i tried to dispel them but sorrow only increased with knowledge oh that i had forever remained in my native wood nor known
3,nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger thirst and heat of what a strange nature is knowledge it clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock i wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling but i learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain and that was deatha state which i feared yet did not understand i admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers but i was shut out from intercourse with them except through means which i obtained by stealth when i was unseen and unknown and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of becoming one among my fellows the gentle words of agatha and the animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me the mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix were not for me miserable unhappy wretch other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply i heard of the difference of sexes and the birth and growth of children how the father doted on the smiles of the infant
4,and the lively sallies of the older child how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge of brother sister and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds but where were my friends and relations no father had watched my infant days no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses or if they had all my past life was now a blot a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing from my earliest remembrance i had been as i then was in height and proportion i had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me what was i the question again recurred to be answered only with groans i will soon explain to what these feelings tended but allow me now to return to the cottagers whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation delight and wonder but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors for so i loved in an innocent halfpainful selfdeceit to call them chapter some time elapsed before i learned
5,the history of my friends it was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind unfolding as it did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as i was the name of the old man was de lacey he was descended from a good family in france where he had lived for many years in affluence respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals his son was bred in the service of his country and agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction a few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called paris surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue refinement of intellect or taste accompanied by a moderate fortune could afford the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin he was a turkish merchant and had inhabited paris for many years when for some reason which i could not learn he became obnoxious to the government he was seized and cast into prison the very day that safie arrived from constantinople to join him he was tried and condemned to death the injustice of
6,his sentence was very flagrant all paris was indignant and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation felix had accidentally been present at the trial his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court he made at that moment a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means after many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate muhammadan who loaded with chains waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour the turk amazed and delighted endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth felix rejected his offers with contempt yet when he saw the lovely safie who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully
7,reward his toil and hazard the turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety felix was too delicate to accept this offer yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness during the ensuing days while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant the zeal of felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man a servant of her father who understood french she thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate i have copies of these letters for i found means during my residence in the hovel to procure the implements of writing and the letters were often in the hands of felix or agatha before i depart i
8,will give them to you they will prove the truth of my tale but at present as the sun is already far declined i shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you safie related that her mother was a christian arab seized and made a slave by the turks recommended by her beauty she had won the heart of the father of safie who married her the young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother who born in freedom spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced she instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of muhammad this lady died but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of safie who sickened at the prospect of again returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements illsuited to the temper of her soul now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue the prospect of marrying a christian and remaining in a country where women were
9,allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her the day for the execution of the turk was fixed but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from paris felix had procured passports in the name of his father sister and himself he had previously communicated his plan to the former who aided the deceit by quitting his house under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself with his daughter in an obscure part of paris felix conducted the fugitives through france to lyons and across mont cenis to leghorn where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the turkish dominions safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure before which time the turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer and felix remained with them in expectation of that event and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the arabian who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection they conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter and sometimes with the interpretation of looks and
10,safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country the turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers while in his heart he had formed far other plans he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a christian but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear lukewarm for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they inhabited he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed his plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris the government of france were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer the plot of felix was quickly discovered and de lacey and agatha were thrown into prison the news reached felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he
11,enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved this idea was torture to him he quickly arranged with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before felix could return to italy safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at leghorn and then quitting the lovely arabian he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding he did not succeed they remained confined for five months before the trial took place the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country they found a miserable asylum in the cottage in germany where i discovered them felix soon learned that the treacherous turk for whom he and his family endured such unheardof oppression on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted italy with his daughter insultingly sending felix a pittance of money to aid him as he said in some plan of future maintenance such were the events that preyed
12,on the heart of felix and rendered him when i first saw him the most miserable of his family he could have endured poverty and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue he gloried in it but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable the arrival of the arabian now infused new life into his soul when the news reached leghorn that felix was deprived of his wealth and rank the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover but to prepare to return to her native country the generous nature of safie was outraged by this command she attempted to expostulate with her father but he left her angrily reiterating his tyrannical mandate a few days after the turk entered his daughter's apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the french government he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to constantinople for which city he should sail in a few hours he intended to leave his daughter under the
13,care of a confidential servant to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property which had not yet arrived at leghorn when alone safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency a residence in turkey was abhorrent to her her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided she hesitated some time but at length she formed her determination taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money she quitted italy with an attendant a native of leghorn but who understood the common language of turkey and departed for germany she arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of de lacey when her attendant fell dangerously ill safie nursed her with the most devoted affection but the poor girl died and the arabian was left alone unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world she fell
14,however into good hands the italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover chapter such was the history of my beloved cottagers it impressed me deeply i learned from the views of social life which it developed to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil benevolence and generosity were ever present before me inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed but in giving an account of the progress of my intellect i must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of august of the same year one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors i found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books i eagerly seized the prize and returned with
15,it to my hovel fortunately the books were written in the language the elements of which i had acquired at the cottage they consisted of paradise lost a volume of plutarch's lives and the sorrows of werter the possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight i now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations i can hardly describe to you the effect of these books they produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings that sometimes raised me to ecstasy but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection in the sorrows of werter besides the interest of its simple and affecting story so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that i found in it a neverending source of speculation and astonishment the gentle and domestic manners it described combined with lofty sentiments and feelings which had for their object something out of self accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were forever alive in my own bosom but i thought werter himself a more divine being than
16,i had ever beheld or imagined his character contained no pretension but it sank deep the disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder i did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case yet i inclined towards the opinions of the hero whose extinction i wept without precisely understanding it as i read however i applied much personally to my own feelings and condition i found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i was a listener i sympathized with and partly understood them but i was unformed in mind i was dependent on none and related to none the path of my departure was free and there was none to lament my annihilation my person was hideous and my stature gigantic what did this mean who was i what was i whence did i come what was my destination these questions continually recurred but i was unable to solve them the volume of plutarch's lives which i possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics this book had a far different effect upon me from
17,the sorrows of werter i learned from werter's imaginations despondency and gloom but plutarch taught me high thoughts he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections to admire and love the heroes of past ages many things i read surpassed my understanding and experience i had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms wide extents of country mighty rivers and boundless seas but i was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men the cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which i had studied human nature but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action i read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring their species i felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me and abhorrence for vice as far as i understood the signification of those terms relative as they were as i applied them to pleasure and pain alone induced by these feelings i was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers numa solon and lycurgus in preference to romulus and theseus the patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind perhaps if my first introduction to humanity
18,had been made by a young soldier burning for glory and slaughter i should have been imbued with different sensations but paradise lost excited different and far deeper emotions i read it as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands as a true history it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of exciting i often referred the several situations as their similarity struck me to my own like adam i was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence but his state was far different from mine in every other respect he had come forth from the hands of god a perfect creature happy and prosperous guarded by the especial care of his creator he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature but i was wretched helpless and alone many times i considered satan as the fitter emblem of my condition for often like him when i viewed the bliss of my protectors the bitter gall of envy rose within me another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings soon after my
19,arrival in the hovel i discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which i had taken from your laboratory at first i had neglected them but now that i was able to decipher the characters in which they were written i began to study them with diligence it was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation you minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences you doubtless recollect these papers here they are everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible i sickened as i read hateful day when i received life i exclaimed in agony accursed creator why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust god in pity made man beautiful and alluring after his own image but my form is a filthy type of yours more horrid
20,even from the very resemblance satan had his companions fellow devils to admire and encourage him but i am solitary and abhorred these were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude but when i contemplated the virtues of the cottagers their amiable and benevolent dispositions i persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity could they turn from their door one however monstrous who solicited their compassion and friendship i resolved at least not to despair but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate i postponed this attempt for some months longer for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest i should fail besides i found that my understanding improved so much with every day's experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity several changes in the meantime took place in the cottage the presence of safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants and i also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there felix and agatha
21,spent more time in amusement and conversation and were assisted in their labours by servants they did not appear rich but they were contented and happy their feelings were serene and peaceful while mine became every day more tumultuous increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was i cherished hope it is true but it vanished when i beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine even as that frail image and that inconstant shade i endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months i resolved to undergo and sometimes i allowed my thoughts unchecked by reason to ramble in the fields of paradise and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation but it was all a dream no eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts i was alone i remembered adam's supplication to his creator but where was mine he had abandoned me and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed him autumn passed thus i saw with surprise and grief the
22,leaves decay and fall and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when i first beheld the woods and the lovely moon yet i did not heed the bleakness of the weather i was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat but my chief delights were the sight of the flowers the birds and all the gay apparel of summer when those deserted me i turned with more attention towards the cottagers their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer they loved and sympathized with one another and their joys depending on each other were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them the more i saw of them the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition i dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror the poor that stopped at their door were never driven away i asked it is true for greater treasures than a little food
23,or rest i required kindness and sympathy but i did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it the winter advanced and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since i awoke into life my attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors i revolved many projects but that on which i finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone i had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me my voice although harsh had nothing terrible in it i thought therefore that if in the absence of his children i could gain the good will and mediation of the old de lacey i might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors one day when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness although it denied warmth safie agatha and felix departed on a long country walk and the old man at his own desire was left alone in the cottage when his children had departed he
24,took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs more sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before at first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure but as he continued thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded at length laying aside the instrument he sat absorbed in reflection my heart beat quick this was the hour and moment of trial which would decide my hopes or realize my fears the servants were gone to a neighbouring fair all was silent in and around the cottage it was an excellent opportunity yet when i proceeded to execute my plan my limbs failed me and i sank to the ground again i rose and exerting all the firmness of which i was master removed the planks which i had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat the fresh air revived me and with renewed determination i approached the door of their cottage i knocked who is there said the old man come in i entered pardon this intrusion said i i am a traveller in want of a little rest you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire enter
25,said de lacey and i will try in what manner i can to relieve your wants but unfortunately my children are from home and as i am blind i am afraid i shall find it difficult to procure food for you do not trouble yourself my kind host i have food it is warmth and rest only that i need i sat down and a silence ensued i knew that every minute was precious to me yet i remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview when the old man addressed me by your language stranger i suppose you are my countryman are you french no but i was educated by a french family and understand that language only i am now going to claim the protection of some friends whom i sincerely love and of whose favour i have some hopes are they germans no they are french but let us change the subject i am an unfortunate and deserted creature i look around and i have no relation or friend upon earth these amiable people to whom i go have never seen me and know little of me i am full of fears for if i fail
26,there i am an outcast in the world forever do not despair to be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate but the hearts of men when unprejudiced by any obvious selfinterest are full of brotherly love and charity rely therefore on your hopes and if these friends are good and amiable do not despair they are kindthey are the most excellent creatures in the world but unfortunately they are prejudiced against me i have good dispositions my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend they behold only a detestable monster that is indeed unfortunate but if you are really blameless cannot you undeceive them i am about to undertake that task and it is on that account that i feel so many overwhelming terrors i tenderly love these friends i have unknown to them been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them but they believe that i wish to injure them and it is that prejudice which i wish to overcome where do these friends reside near this spot the old man paused and then
27,continued if you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale i perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them i am blind and cannot judge of your countenance but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere i am poor and an exile but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature excellent man i thank you and accept your generous offer you raise me from the dust by this kindness and i trust that by your aid i shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures heaven forbid even if you were really criminal for that can only drive you to desperation and not instigate you to virtue i also am unfortunate i and my family have been condemned although innocent judge therefore if i do not feel for your misfortunes how can i thank you my best and only benefactor from your lips first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me i shall be forever grateful and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom i am on the point of
28,meeting may i know the names and residence of those friends i paused this i thought was the moment of decision which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever i struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength i sank on the chair and sobbed aloud at that moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors i had not a moment to lose but seizing the hand of the old man i cried now is the time save and protect me you and your family are the friends whom i seek do not you desert me in the hour of trial great god exclaimed the old man who are you at that instant the cottage door was opened and felix safie and agatha entered who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me agatha fainted and safie unable to attend to her friend rushed out of the cottage felix darted forward and with supernatural force tore me from his father to whose knees i clung in a transport of fury he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick i could have
29,torn him limb from limb as the lion rends the antelope but my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness and i refrained i saw him on the point of repeating his blow when overcome by pain and anguish i quitted the cottage and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel chapter cursed cursed creator why did i live why in that instant did i not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed i know not despair had not yet taken possession of me my feelings were those of rage and revenge i could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery when night came i quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood and now no longer restrained by the fear of discovery i gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings i was like a wild beast that had broken the toils destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a staglike swiftness oh what a miserable night i passed the cold stars shone in mockery and the bare trees waved their branches above me now and
30,then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness all save i were at rest or in enjoyment i like the archfiend bore a hell within me and finding myself unsympathized with wished to tear up the trees spread havoc and destruction around me and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin but this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure i became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair there was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me and should i feel kindness towards my enemies no from that moment i declared everlasting war against the species and more than all against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery the sun rose i heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day accordingly i hid myself in some thick underwood determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation the pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity
31,and when i considered what had passed at the cottage i could not help believing that i had been too hasty in my conclusions i had certainly acted imprudently it was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf and i was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children i ought to have familiarized the old de lacey to me and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family when they should have been prepared for my approach but i did not believe my errors to be irretrievable and after much consideration i resolved to return to the cottage seek the old man and by my representations win him to my party these thoughts calmed me and in the afternoon i sank into a profound sleep but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams the horrible scene of the preceding day was forever acting before my eyes the females were flying and the enraged felix tearing me from his father's feet i awoke exhausted and finding that it was already night i crept forth from my hidingplace and went
32,in search of food when my hunger was appeased i directed my steps towards the wellknown path that conducted to the cottage all there was at peace i crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose that hour passed the sun mounted high in the heavens but the cottagers did not appear i trembled violently apprehending some dreadful misfortune the inside of the cottage was dark and i heard no motion i cannot describe the agony of this suspense presently two countrymen passed by but pausing near the cottage they entered into conversation using violent gesticulations but i did not understand what they said as they spoke the language of the country which differed from that of my protectors soon after however felix approached with another man i was surprised as i knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances do you consider said his companion to him that you will be obliged to pay three months rent and to lose the produce of your garden i do not wish to take any unfair advantage
33,and i beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination it is utterly useless replied felix we can never again inhabit your cottage the life of my father is in the greatest danger owing to the dreadful circumstance that i have related my wife and my sister will never recover from their horror i entreat you not to reason with me any more take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place felix trembled violently as he said this he and his companion entered the cottage in which they remained for a few minutes and then departed i never saw any of the family of de lacey more i continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair my protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world for the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom and i did not strive to control them but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream i bent my mind towards injury and death when i thought of my friends of the mild voice
34,of de lacey the gentle eyes of agatha and the exquisite beauty of the arabian these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me but again when i reflected that they had spurned and deserted me anger returned a rage of anger and unable to injure anything human i turned my fury towards inanimate objects as night advanced i placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden i waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations as the night advanced a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection i lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage my eyes still fixed on the western horizon the edge of which the moon nearly touched a part of its orb was at length hid and i waved my brand it sank and with a loud scream i fired the straw and heath
35,and bushes which i had collected the wind fanned the fire and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues as soon as i was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation i quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods and now with the world before me whither should i bend my steps i resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes but to me hated and despised every country must be equally horrible at length the thought of you crossed my mind i learned from your papers that you were my father my creator and to whom could i apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life among the lessons that felix had bestowed upon safie geography had not been omitted i had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth you had mentioned geneva as the name of your native town and towards this place i resolved to proceed but how was i to direct myself i knew that i must travel in a southwesterly direction to
36,reach my destination but the sun was my only guide i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass through nor could i ask information from a single human being but i did not despair from you only could i hope for succour although towards you i felt no sentiment but that of hatred unfeeling heartless creator you had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress and from you i determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense it was late in autumn when i quitted the district where i had so long resided i travelled only at night fearful of encountering the visage of a human being nature decayed around me and the sun became heatless rain and snow poured around me mighty rivers were frozen the surface of the earth was hard and chill and bare and i found no shelter oh earth how often did
37,i imprecate curses on the cause of my being the mildness of my nature had fled and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness the nearer i approached to your habitation the more deeply did i feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart snow fell and the waters were hardened but i rested not a few incidents now and then directed me and i possessed a map of the country but i often wandered wide from my path the agony of my feelings allowed me no respite no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food but a circumstance that happened when i arrived on the confines of switzerland when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings i generally rested during the day and travelled only when i was secured by night from the view of man one morning however finding that my path lay through a deep wood i ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen the day which was one of the first of spring cheered even
38,me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air i felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure that had long appeared dead revive within me half surprised by the novelty of these sensations i allowed myself to be borne away by them and forgetting my solitude and deformity dared to be happy soft tears again bedewed my cheeks and i even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me i continued to wind among the paths of the wood until i came to its boundary which was skirted by a deep and rapid river into which many of the trees bent their branches now budding with the fresh spring here i paused not exactly knowing what path to pursue when i heard the sound of voices that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress i was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where i was concealed laughing as if she ran from someone in sport she continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river when suddenly her foot slipped and she fell into the rapid stream i rushed
39,from my hidingplace and with extreme labour from the force of the current saved her and dragged her to shore she was senseless and i endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation when i was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled on seeing me he darted towards me and tearing the girl from my arms hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood i followed speedily i hardly knew why but when the man saw me draw near he aimed a gun which he carried at my body and fired i sank to the ground and my injurer with increased swiftness escaped into the wood this was then the reward of my benevolence i had saved a human being from destruction and as a recompense i now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone the feelings of kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth inflamed by pain i vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind but the agony of my wound overcame
40,me my pulses paused and i fainted for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods endeavouring to cure the wound which i had received the ball had entered my shoulder and i knew not whether it had remained there or passed through at any rate i had no means of extracting it my sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction my daily vows rose for revengea deep and deadly revenge such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had endured after some weeks my wound healed and i continued my journey the labours i endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that i was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure but my toils now drew near a close and in two months from this time i reached the environs of geneva it was evening when i arrived and i retired to a hidingplace among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner i should apply to
41,you i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of jura at this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child who came running into the recess i had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy suddenly as i gazed on him an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity if therefore i could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend i should not be so desolate in this peopled earth urged by this impulse i seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me as soon as he beheld my form he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream i drew his hand forcibly from his face and said child what is the meaning of this i do not intend to hurt you listen to me he struggled violently let me go he cried monster ugly wretch you wish
42,to eat me and tear me to pieces you are an ogre let me go or i will tell my papa boy you will never see your father again you must come with me hideous monster let me go my papa is a syndiche is m he will punish you you dare not keep me you belong then to my enemyto him towards whom i have sworn eternal revenge you shall be my first victim the child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart i grasped his throat to silence him and in a moment he lay dead at my feet i gazed on my victim and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph clapping my hands i exclaimed i too can create desolation my enemy is not invulnerable this death will carry despair to him and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him as i fixed my eyes on the child i saw something glittering on his breast i took it it was a portrait of a most lovely woman in spite of my malignity it softened and attracted me for a few moments i gazed with delight on her
43,dark eyes fringed by deep lashes and her lovely lips but presently my rage returned i remembered that i was forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance i contemplated would in regarding me have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage i only wonder that at that moment instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony i did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them while i was overcome by these feelings i left the spot where i had committed the murder and seeking a more secluded hidingplace i entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty a woman was sleeping on some straw she was young not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait i held but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health here i thought is one of those whose joyimparting smiles are bestowed on all but me and then i bent over her and whispered awake fairest thy lover is nearhe who would give his life
44,but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes my beloved awake the sleeper stirred a thrill of terror ran through me should she indeed awake and see me and curse me and denounce the murderer thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me the thought was madness it stirred the fiend within menot i but she shall suffer the murder i have committed because i am forever robbed of all that she could give me she shall atone the crime had its source in her be hers the punishment thanks to the lessons of felix and the sanguinary laws of man i had learned now to work mischief i bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress she moved again and i fled for some days i haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place sometimes wishing to see you sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries forever at length i wandered towards these mountains and have ranged through their immense recesses consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify we may not part until you have promised to
45,comply with my requisition i am alone and miserable man will not associate with me but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me my companion must be of the same species and have the same defects this being you must create chapter the being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply but i was bewildered perplexed and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition he continued you must create a female for me with whom i can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being this you alone can do and i demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede the latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers and as he said this i could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me i do refuse it i replied and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me you may render me the most miserable of men but you shall never
46,make me base in my own eyes shall i create another like yourself whose joint wickedness might desolate the world begone i have answered you you may torture me but i will never consent you are in the wrong replied the fiend and instead of threatening i am content to reason with you i am malicious because i am miserable am i not shunned and hated by all mankind you my creator would tear me to pieces and triumph remember that and tell me why i should pity man more than he pities me you would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those icerifts and destroy my frame the work of your own hands shall i respect man when he condemns me let him live with me in the interchange of kindness and instead of injury i would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance but that cannot be the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery i will revenge my injuries if i cannot inspire love i will cause fear and chiefly towards you my archenemy because
47,my creator do i swear inextinguishable hatred have a care i will work at your destruction nor finish until i desolate your heart so that you shall curse the hour of your birth a fiendish rage animated him as he said this his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold but presently he calmed himself and proceeded i intended to reason this passion is detrimental to me for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess if any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me i should return them a hundred and a hundredfold for that one creature's sake i would make peace with the whole kind but i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized what i ask of you is reasonable and moderate i demand a creature of another sex but as hideous as myself the gratification is small but it is all that i can receive and it shall content me it is true we shall be monsters cut off from all the world but on that account we shall be more attached to one another our lives will not be happy but they will
48,be harmless and free from the misery i now feel oh my creator make me happy let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit let me see that i excite the sympathy of some existing thing do not deny me my request i was moved i shuddered when i thought of the possible consequences of my consent but i felt that there was some justice in his argument his tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations and did i not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow he saw my change of feeling and continued if you consent neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again i will go to the vast wilds of south america my food is not that of man i do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment my companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare we shall make our bed of dried leaves the sun will shine on us
49,as on man and will ripen our food the picture i present to you is peaceful and human and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty pitiless as you have been towards me i now see compassion in your eyes let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what i so ardently desire you propose replied i to fly from the habitations of man to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions how can you who long for the love and sympathy of man persevere in this exile you will return and again seek their kindness and you will meet with their detestation your evil passions will be renewed and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction this may not be cease to argue the point for i cannot consent how inconstant are your feelings but a moment ago you were moved by my representations and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints i swear to you by the earth which i inhabit and by you that made me that with
50,the companion you bestow i will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell as it may chance in the most savage of places my evil passions will have fled for i shall meet with sympathy my life will flow quietly away and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker his words had a strange effect upon me i compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him but when i looked upon him when i saw the filthy mass that moved and talked my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred i tried to stifle these sensations i thought that as i could not sympathize with him i had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow you swear i said to be harmless but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you may not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge how is this i must not be trifled with and i demand an answer if i have no
51,ties and no affections hatred and vice must be my portion the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes and i shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant my vices are the children of a forced solitude that i abhor and my virtues will necessarily arise when i live in communion with an equal i shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which i am now excluded i paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed i thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him his power and threats were not omitted in my calculations a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with after a long pause of reflection i concluded that the justice due both
52,to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that i should comply with his request turning to him therefore i said i consent to your demand on your solemn oath to quit europe forever and every other place in the neighbourhood of man as soon as i shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile i swear he cried by the sun and by the blue sky of heaven and by the fire of love that burns my heart that if you grant my prayer while they exist you shall never behold me again depart to your home and commence your labours i shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety and fear not but that when you are ready i shall appear saying this he suddenly quitted me fearful perhaps of any change in my sentiments i saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice his tale had occupied the whole day and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed i knew that i ought to hasten my descent towards the
53,valley as i should soon be encompassed in darkness but my heart was heavy and my steps slow the labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced perplexed me occupied as i was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced night was far advanced when i came to the halfway restingplace and seated myself beside the fountain the stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them the dark pines rose before me and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me i wept bitterly and clasping my hands in agony i exclaimed oh stars and clouds and winds ye are all about to mock me if ye really pity me crush sensation and memory let me become as nought but if not depart depart and leave me in darkness these were wild and miserable thoughts but i cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how i listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly
54,siroc on its way to consume me morning dawned before i arrived at the village of chamounix i took no rest but returned immediately to geneva even in my own heart i could give no expression to my sensationsthey weighed on me with a mountain's weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them thus i returned home and entering the house presented myself to the family my haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm but i answered no question scarcely did i speak i felt as if i were placed under a banas if i had no right to claim their sympathiesas if never more might i enjoy companionship with them yet even thus i loved them to adoration and to save them i resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task the prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream and that thought only had to me the reality of life chapter day after day week after week passed away on my return to geneva and i could not collect the courage to recommence my work i feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet i was unable
55,to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me i found that i could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition i had heard of some discoveries having been made by an english philosopher the knowledge of which was material to my success and i sometimes thought of obtaining my father's consent to visit england for this purpose but i clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me a change indeed had taken place in me my health which had hitherto declined was now much restored and my spirits when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise rose proportionably my father saw this change with pleasure and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy which every now and then would return by fits and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine at these moments i took refuge in the most perfect solitude i passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat watching the clouds and listening to the rippling
56,of the waves silent and listless but the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure and on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart it was after my return from one of these rambles that my father calling me aside thus addressed me i am happy to remark my dear son that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself and yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society for some time i was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this but yesterday an idea struck me and if it is well founded i conjure you to avow it reserve on such a point would be not only useless but draw down treble misery on us all i trembled violently at his exordium and my father continuedi confess my son that i have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years you were attached to each other from your earliest infancy you studied together and appeared
57,in dispositions and tastes entirely suited to one another but so blind is the experience of man that what i conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it you perhaps regard her as your sister without any wish that she might become your wife nay you may have met with another whom you may love and considering yourself as bound in honour to elizabeth this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel my dear father reassure yourself i love my cousin tenderly and sincerely i never saw any woman who excited as elizabeth does my warmest admiration and affection my future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union the expression of your sentiments of this subject my dear victor gives me more pleasure than i have for some time experienced if you feel thus we shall assuredly be happy however present events may cast a gloom over us but it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissipate tell me therefore whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the marriage we
58,have been unfortunate and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities you are younger yet i do not suppose possessed as you are of a competent fortune that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed do not suppose however that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness interpret my words with candour and answer me i conjure you with confidence and sincerity i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply i revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion alas to me the idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth was one of horror and dismay i was bound by a solemn promise which i had not yet fulfilled and dared not break or if i did what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family could i enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the
59,ground i must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before i allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which i expected peace i remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to england or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking the latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory besides i had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father's house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those i loved i knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror i was aware also that i should often lose all selfcommand all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation i must absent myself from all i loved while thus employed once commenced it would quickly be achieved and i might be restored to my family in peace and happiness my promise fulfilled the monster
60,would depart forever or so my fond fancy imaged some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery forever these feelings dictated my answer to my father i expressed a wish to visit england but concealing the true reasons of this request i clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion while i urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply after so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects he was glad to find that i was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would before my return have restored me entirely to myself the duration of my absence was left to my own choice a few months or at most a year was the period contemplated one paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion without previously communicating with me he had in concert with elizabeth arranged that clerval should join me at strasbourg this interfered with the solitude i coveted for the prosecution of my task yet at
61,the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment and truly i rejoiced that thus i should be saved many hours of lonely maddening reflection nay henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe if i were alone would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress to england therefore i was bound and it was understood that my union with elizabeth should take place immediately on my return my father's age rendered him extremely averse to delay for myself there was one reward i promised myself from my detested toilsone consolation for my unparalleled sufferings it was the prospect of that day when enfranchised from my miserable slavery i might claim elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her i now made arrangements for my journey but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation during my absence i should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks exasperated as he might be by my departure but he had promised to follow me
62,wherever i might go and would he not accompany me to england this imagination was dreadful in itself but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends i was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen but through the whole period during which i was the slave of my creature i allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations it was in the latter end of september that i again quitted my native country my journey had been my own suggestion and elizabeth therefore acquiesced but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering away from her the inroads of misery and grief it had been her care which provided me a companion in clervaland yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman's sedulous attention she longed to bid me hasten my return a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful silent farewell i threw myself into the carriage that was
63,to convey me away hardly knowing whither i was going and careless of what was passing around i remembered only and it was with a bitter anguish that i reflected on it to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me filled with dreary imaginations i passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes but my eyes were fixed and unobserving i could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured after some days spent in listless indolence during which i traversed many leagues i arrived at strasbourg where i waited two days for clerval he came alas how great was the contrast between us he was alive to every new scene joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day he pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky this is what it is to live he cried how i enjoy existence but you my dear wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful in truth i was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw
64,the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the rhine and you my friend would be far more amused with the journal of clerval who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight than in listening to my reflections i a miserable wretch haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment we had agreed to descend the rhine in a boat from strasbourg to rotterdam whence we might take shipping for london during this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns we stayed a day at mannheim and on the fifth from our departure from strasbourg arrived at mainz the course of the rhine below mainz becomes much more picturesque the river descends rapidly and winds between hills not high but steep and of beautiful forms we saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices surrounded by black woods high and inaccessible this part of the rhine indeed presents a singularly variegated landscape in one spot you view rugged hills ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices with the dark rhine rushing beneath and on the sudden turn of a promontory flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks
65,and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream even i depressed in mind and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings even i was pleased i lay at the bottom of the boat and as i gazed on the cloudless blue sky i seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which i had long been a stranger and if these were my sensations who can describe those of henry he felt as if he had been transported to fairyland and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man i have seen he said the most beautiful scenes of my own country i have visited the lakes of lucerne and uri where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water casting black and impenetrable shades which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that believe the eye by their gay appearance i have seen this lake agitated by a tempest when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the waterspout must be on
66,the great ocean and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind i have seen the mountains of la valais and the pays de vaud but this country victor pleases me more than all those wonders the mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalled look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice and that also on the island almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain oh surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country clerval beloved friend even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently
67,deserving he was a being formed in the very poetry of nature his wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart his soul overflowed with ardent affections and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldminded teach us to look for only in the imagination but even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind the scenery of external nature which others regard only with admiration he loved with ardour the sounding cataract haunted him like a passion the tall rock the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood their colours and their forms were then to him an appetite a feeling and a love that had no need of a remoter charm by thought supplied or any interest unborrow'd from the eye wordsworth's tintern abbey and where does he now exist is this gentle and lovely being lost forever has this mind so replete with ideas imaginations fanciful and magnificent which formed a world whose existence depended on the life of its creatorhas this mind perished does it now only exist in my memory no it is not thus your form so divinely wrought and beaming with beauty has
68,decayed but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend pardon this gush of sorrow these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of henry but they soothe my heart overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates i will proceed with my tale beyond cologne we descended to the plains of holland and we resolved to post the remainder of our way for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery but we arrived in a few days at rotterdam whence we proceeded by sea to england it was on a clear morning in the latter days of december that i first saw the white cliffs of britain the banks of the thames presented a new scene they were flat but fertile and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story we saw tilbury fort and remembered the spanish armada gravesend woolwich and greenwichplaces which i had heard of even in my country at length we saw the numerous steeples of london st paul's towering above all and the tower famed in english
69,history chapter london was our present point of rest we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time but this was with me a secondary object i was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that i had brought with me addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers if this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure but a blight had come over my existence and i only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound company was irksome to me when alone i could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth the voice of henry soothed me and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace but busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart i saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men this barrier
70,was sealed with the blood of william and justine and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish but in clerval i saw the image of my former self he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction the difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement he was also pursuing an object he had long had in view his design was to visit india in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages and in the views he had taken of its society the means of materially assisting the progress of european colonization and trade in britain only could he further the execution of his plan he was forever busy and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind i tried to conceal this as much as possible that i might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection i often refused to accompany him alleging another engagement that i might remain alone i now also began to collect
71,the materials necessary for my new creation and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver and my heart to palpitate after passing some months in london we received a letter from a person in scotland who had formerly been our visitor at geneva he mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth where he resided clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation and i although i abhorred society wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwellingplaces we had arrived in england at the beginning of october and it was now february we accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month in this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to edinburgh but to visit windsor oxford matlock and the cumberland lakes resolving to
72,arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of july i packed up my chemical instruments and the materials i had collected resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland we quitted london on the 27th of march and remained a few days at windsor rambling in its beautiful forest this was a new scene to us mountaineers the majestic oaks the quantity of game and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us from thence we proceeded to oxford as we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before it was here that charles i had collected his forces this city had remained faithful to him after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty the memory of that unfortunate king and his companions the amiable falkland the insolent goring his queen and son gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited the spirit of elder days found a dwelling here and we
73,delighted to trace its footsteps if these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration the colleges are ancient and picturesque the streets are almost magnificent and the lovely isis which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers and spires and domes embosomed among aged trees i enjoyed this scene and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future i was formed for peaceful happiness during my youthful days discontent never visited my mind and if i was ever overcome by ennui the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits but i am a blasted tree the bolt has entered my soul and i felt then that i should survive to exhibit what i shall soon cease to bea miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity pitiable to others and intolerable to myself we passed a
74,considerable period at oxford rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of english history our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves we visited the tomb of the illustrious hampden and the field on which that patriot fell for a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers for an instant i dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit but the iron had eaten into my flesh and i sank again trembling and hopeless into my miserable self we left oxford with regret and proceeded to matlock which was our next place of rest the country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled to a greater degree the scenery of switzerland but everything is on a lower scale and the green hills want the crown of distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country we visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of
75,natural history where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix the latter name made me tremble when pronounced by henry and i hastened to quit matlock with which that terrible scene was thus associated from derby still journeying northwards we passed two months in cumberland and westmorland i could now almost fancy myself among the swiss mountains the little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains the lakes and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me here also we made some acquaintances who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than mine his mind expanded in the company of men of talent and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors i could pass my life here said he to me and among these mountains i should scarcely regret switzerland and the rhine but he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments his feelings are forever on
76,the stretch and when he begins to sink into repose he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new which again engages his attention and which also he forsakes for other novelties we had scarcely visited the various lakes of cumberland and westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our scotch friend approached and we left them to travel on for my own part i was not sorry i had now neglected my promise for some time and i feared the effects of the daemon's disappointment he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives this idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which i might otherwise have snatched repose and peace i waited for my letters with feverish impatience if they were delayed i was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears and when they arrived and i saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father i hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate sometimes i thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion when these thoughts possessed
77,me i would not quit henry for a moment but followed him as his shadow to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer i felt as if i had committed some great crime the consciousness of which haunted me i was guiltless but i had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head as mortal as that of crime i visited edinburgh with languid eyes and mind and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being clerval did not like it so well as oxford for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him but the beauty and regularity of the new town of edinburgh its romantic castle and its environs the most delightful in the world arthur's seat st bernard's well and the pentland hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration but i was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey we left edinburgh in a week passing through coupar st andrew's and along the banks of the tay to perth where our friend expected us but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings
78,or plans with the good humour expected from a guest and accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland alone do you said i enjoy yourself and let this be our rendezvous i may be absent a month or two but do not interfere with my motions i entreat you leave me to peace and solitude for a short time and when i return i hope it will be with a lighter heart more congenial to your own temper henry wished to dissuade me but seeing me bent on this plan ceased to remonstrate he entreated me to write often i had rather be with you he said in your solitary rambles than with these scotch people whom i do not know hasten then my dear friend to return that i may again feel myself somewhat at home which i cannot do in your absence having parted from my friend i determined to visit some remote spot of scotland and finish my work in solitude i did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when i should have finished that he might receive his companion with this resolution
79,i traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the orkneys as the scene of my labours it was a place fitted for such a work being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves the soil was barren scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows and oatmeal for its inhabitants which consisted of five persons whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare vegetables and bread when they indulged in such luxuries and even fresh water was to be procured from the mainland which was about five miles distant on the whole island there were but three miserable huts and one of these was vacant when i arrived this i hired it contained but two rooms and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury the thatch had fallen in the walls were unplastered and the door was off its hinges i ordered it to be repaired bought some furniture and took possession an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty as it was i lived
80,ungazed at and unmolested hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which i gave so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men in this retreat i devoted the morning to labour but in the evening when the weather permitted i walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet it was a monotonous yet everchanging scene i thought of switzerland it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape its hills are covered with vines and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky and when troubled by the winds their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived but as i proceeded in my labour it became every day more horrible and irksome to me sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days and at other times i toiled day and night in order to complete my work it was indeed a filthy process
81,in which i was engaged during my first experiment a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings but now i went to it in cold blood and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands thus situated employed in the most detestable occupation immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which i was engaged my spirits became unequal i grew restless and nervous every moment i feared to meet my persecutor sometimes i sat with my eyes fixed on the ground fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which i so much dreaded to behold i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion in the mean time i worked on and my labour was already considerably advanced i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope which i dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings
82,of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom chapter i sat one evening in my laboratory the sun had set and the moon was just rising from the sea i had not sufficient light for my employment and i remained idle in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it as i sat a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what i was now doing three years before i was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it forever with the bitterest remorse i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i was alike ignorant she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight for its own sake in murder and wretchedness he had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts but she had not and she who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation
83,they might even hate each other the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form she also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man she might quit him and he be again alone exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would be children and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror had i right for my own benefit to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations i had before been moved by the sophisms of the being i had created i had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats but now for the first time the wickedness of my promise burst upon me i shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest whose selfishness had
84,not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race i trembled and my heart failed within me when on looking up i saw by the light of the moon the daemon at the casement a ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me where i sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me yes he had followed me in my travels he had loitered in forests hid himself in caves or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise as i looked on him his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery i thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him and trembling with passion tore to pieces the thing on which i was engaged the wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge withdrew i left the room and locking the door made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours and then
85,with trembling steps i sought my own apartment i was alone none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries several hours passed and i remained near my window gazing on the sea it was almost motionless for the winds were hushed and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon a few fishing vessels alone specked the water and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another i felt the silence although i was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore and a person landed close to my house in a few minutes after i heard the creaking of my door as if some one endeavoured to open it softly i trembled from head to foot i felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine but i was overcome by the sensation of helplessness so often felt in frightful dreams when you in vain endeavour to fly
86,from an impending danger and was rooted to the spot presently i heard the sound of footsteps along the passage the door opened and the wretch whom i dreaded appeared shutting the door he approached me and said in a smothered voice you have destroyed the work which you began what is it that you intend do you dare to break your promise i have endured toil and misery i left switzerland with you i crept along the shores of the rhine among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills i have dwelt many months in the heaths of england and among the deserts of scotland i have endured incalculable fatigue and cold and hunger do you dare destroy my hopes begone i do break my promise never will i create another like yourself equal in deformity and wickedness slave i before reasoned with you but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension remember that i have power you believe yourself miserable but i can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you you are my creator but i am your master obey the hour of my irresolution is past
87,and the period of your power is arrived your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice shall i in cool blood set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness begone i am firm and your words will only exasperate my rage the monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger shall each man cried he find a wife for his bosom and each beast have his mate and i be alone i had feelings of affection and they were requited by detestation and scorn man you may hate but beware your hours will pass in dread and misery and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness forever are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness you can blast my other passions but revenge remainsrevenge henceforth dearer than light or food i may die but first you my tyrant and tormentor shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery beware for i am fearless and therefore powerful
88,i will watch with the wiliness of a snake that i may sting with its venom man you shall repent of the injuries you inflict devil cease and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice i have declared my resolution to you and i am no coward to bend beneath words leave me i am inexorable it is well i go but remember i shall be with you on your weddingnight i started forward and exclaimed villain before you sign my deathwarrant be sure that you are yourself safe i would have seized him but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation in a few moments i saw him in his boat which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves all was again silent but his words rang in my ears i burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean i walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me why had i not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife but i had
89,suffered him to depart and he had directed his course towards the mainland i shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge and then i thought again of his wordsi will be with you on your weddingnight that then was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny in that hour i should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice the prospect did not move me to fear yet when i thought of my beloved elizabeth of her tears and endless sorrow when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her tears the first i had shed for many months streamed from my eyes and i resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle the night passed away and the sun rose from the ocean my feelings became calmer if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair i left the house the horrid scene of the last night's contention and walked on the beach of the sea which i almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures nay a wish that such should
90,prove the fact stole across me i desired that i might pass my life on that barren rock wearily it is true but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery if i returned it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom i most loved die under the grasp of a daemon whom i had myself created i walked about the isle like a restless spectre separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation when it became noon and the sun rose higher i lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep i had been awake the whole of the preceding night my nerves were agitated and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery the sleep into which i now sank refreshed me and when i awoke i again felt as if i belonged to a race of human beings like myself and i began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a deathknell they appeared like a dream yet distinct and oppressive as a reality the sun had far descended and i still sat on the shore satisfying
91,my appetite which had become ravenous with an oaten cake when i saw a fishingboat land close to me and one of the men brought me a packet it contained letters from geneva and one from clerval entreating me to join him he said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was that letters from the friends he had formed in london desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his indian enterprise he could not any longer delay his departure but as his journey to london might be followed even sooner than he now conjectured by his longer voyage he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as i could spare he besought me therefore to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth that we might proceed southwards together this letter in a degree recalled me to life and i determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days yet before i departed there was a task to perform on which i shuddered to reflect i must pack up my chemical instruments and for that purpose i must enter the room which had
92,been the scene of my odious work and i must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me the next morning at daybreak i summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory the remains of the halffinished creature whom i had destroyed lay scattered on the floor and i almost felt as if i had mangled the living flesh of a human being i paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber with trembling hand i conveyed the instruments out of the room but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants and i accordingly put them into a basket with a great quantity of stones and laying them up determined to throw them into the sea that very night and in the meantime i sat upon the beach employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the daemon i had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that with whatever consequences must be
93,fulfilled but i now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw clearly the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts but i did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it i had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness and i banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion between two and three in the morning the moon rose and i then putting my basket aboard a little skiff sailed out about four miles from the shore the scene was perfectly solitary a few boats were returning towards land but i sailed away from them i felt as if i was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures at one time the moon which had before been clear was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud and i took advantage of the moment
94,of darkness and cast my basket into the sea i listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot the sky became clouded but the air was pure although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water and fixing the rudder in a direct position stretched myself at the bottom of the boat clouds hid the moon everything was obscure and i heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves the murmur lulled me and in a short time i slept soundly i do not know how long i remained in this situation but when i awoke i found that the sun had already mounted considerably the wind was high and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff i found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which i had embarked i endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water
95,thus situated my only resource was to drive before the wind i confess that i felt a few sensations of terror i had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me i might be driven into the wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me i had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst a prelude to my other sufferings i looked on the heavens which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind only to be replaced by others i looked upon the sea it was to be my grave fiend i exclaimed your task is already fulfilled i thought of elizabeth of my father and of clervalall left behind on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions this idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now when the scene is on the point of closing before me forever i shudder to reflect on it some hours passed thus but
96,by degrees as the sun declined towards the horizon the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers but these gave place to a heavy swell i felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder when suddenly i saw a line of high land towards the south almost spent as i was by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured for several hours this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart and tears gushed from my eyes how mutable are our feelings and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery i constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land it had a wild and rocky appearance but as i approached nearer i easily perceived the traces of cultivation i saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man i carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory as i was in a state of extreme debility
97,i resolved to sail directly towards the town as a place where i could most easily procure nourishment fortunately i had money with me as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good harbour which i entered my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails several people crowded towards the spot they seemed much surprised at my appearance but instead of offering me any assistance whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm as it was i merely remarked that they spoke english and i therefore addressed them in that language my good friends said i will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where i am you will know that soon enough replied a man with a hoarse voice maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste but you will not be consulted as to your quarters i promise you i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger and
98,i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions why do you answer me so roughly i replied surely it is not the custom of englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably i do not know said the man what the custom of the english may be but it is the custom of the irish to hate villains while this strange dialogue continued i perceived the crowd rapidly increase their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me i inquired the way to the inn but no one replied i then moved forward and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me when an illlooking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said come sir you must follow me to mr kirwin's to give an account of yourself who is mr kirwin why am i to give an account of myself is not this a free country ay sir free enough for honest folks mr kirwin is a magistrate and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night this answer startled
99,me but i presently recovered myself i was innocent that could easily be proved accordingly i followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town i was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger but being surrounded by a crowd i thought it politic to rouse all my strength that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt little did i then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death i must pause here for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which i am about to relate in proper detail to my recollection chapter i was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners he looked upon me however with some degree of severity and then turning towards my conductors he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion about half a dozen men came forward and one being selected by the magistrate he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son
100,and brotherinlaw daniel nugent when about ten o'clock they observed a strong northerly blast rising and they accordingly put in for port it was a very dark night as the moon had not yet risen they did not land at the harbour but as they had been accustomed at a creek about two miles below he walked on first carrying a part of the fishing tackle and his companions followed him at some distance as he was proceeding along the sands he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground his companions came up to assist him and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man who was to all appearance dead their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold they instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured but in vain to restore it to life it appeared to be a
101,handsome young man about five and twenty years of age he had apparently been strangled for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated my limbs trembled and a mist came over my eyes which obliged me to lean on a chair for support the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner the son confirmed his father's account but when daniel nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion he saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the shore and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars it was the same boat in which i had just landed a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage waiting for the return of the fishermen about an hour before she heard
102,of the discovery of the body when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house it was not cold they put it into a bed and rubbed it and daniel went to the town for an apothecary but life was quite gone several other men were examined concerning my landing and they agreed that with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night it was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed besides they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body from another place and it was likely that as i did not appear to know the shore i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of from the place where i had deposited the corpse mr kirwin on hearing this evidence desired that i should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment that it
103,might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me this idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described i was accordingly conducted by the magistrate and several other persons to the inn i could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night but knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i had inhabited about the time that the body had been found i was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin how can i describe my sensations on beholding it i feel yet parched with horror nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony the examination the presence of the magistrate and witnesses passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry clerval stretched before me i gasped for breath and throwing myself on the body i exclaimed have my murderous machinations deprived you also my dearest henry of life two i have already
104,at least five feet higher than when i lived by it there is a narrow sandbar running into it with very deep water on one side on which i helped boil a kettle of chowder some six rods from the main shore about the year which it has not been possible to do for twentyfive years and on the other hand my friends used to listen with incredulity when i told them that a few years later i was accustomed to fish from a boat in a secluded cove in the woods fifteen rods from the only shore they knew which place was long since converted into a meadow but the pond has risen steadily for two years and now in the summer of is just five feet higher than when i lived there or as high as it was thirty years ago and fishing goes on again in the meadow this makes a difference of level at the outside of six or seven feet and yet the water shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount and this overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs this same summer the pond has begun to fall
105,destroyed other victims await their destiny but you clerval my friend my benefactor the human frame could no longer support the agonies that i endured and i was carried out of the room in strong convulsions a fever succeeded to this i lay for two months on the point of death my ravings as i afterwards heard were frightful i called myself the murderer of william of justine and of clerval sometimes i entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was tormented and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck and screamed aloud with agony and terror fortunately as i spoke my native language mr kirwin alone understood me but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses why did i not die more miserable than man ever was before why did i not sink into forgetfulness and rest death snatches away many blooming children the only hopes of their doting parents how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb
106,again it is remarkable that this fluctuation whether periodical or not appears thus to require many years for its accomplishment i have observed one rise and a part of two falls and i expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence the water will again be as low as i have ever known it flint's pond a mile eastward allowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inlets and outlets and the smaller intermediate ponds also sympathize with and recently attained their greatest height at the same time with the latter the same is true as far as my observation goes of white pond this rise and fall of at long intervals serves this use at least the water standing at this great height for a year or more though it makes it difficult to walk round it kills the shrubs and trees which have sprung up about its edge since the last risepitch pines birches alders aspens and othersand falling again leaves an unobstructed shore for unlike many ponds and all waters which are subject to a daily tide its shore is cleanest when the water is lowest on the side of the pond next my house a row of
107,of what materials was i made that i could thus resist so many shocks which like the turning of the wheel continually renewed the torture but i was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream in a prison stretched on a wretched bed surrounded by jailers turnkeys bolts and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon it was morning i remember when i thus awoke to understanding i had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me but when i looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i was all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me she was a hired nurse the wife of one of the turnkeys and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize that class the lines of her face were hard and rude like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of misery her tone expressed her entire indifference she addressed me in english and the voice struck
108,pitch pines fifteen feet high has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever and thus a stop put to their encroachments and their size indicates how many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height by this fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore and thus the shore is shorn and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession these are the lips of the lake on which no beard grows it licks its chaps from time to time when the water is at its height the alders willows and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feet long from all sides of their stems in the water and to the height of three or four feet from the ground in the effort to maintain themselves and i have known the high blueberry bushes about the shore which commonly produce no fruit bear an abundant crop under these circumstances some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved my townsmen have all heard the traditionthe oldest people tell me that they heard it in their youththat anciently the indians were holding a powwow upon a
109,me as one that i had heard during my sufferings are you better now sir said she i replied in the same language with a feeble voice i believe i am but if it be all true if indeed i did not dream i am sorry that i am still alive to feel this misery and horror for that matter replied the old woman if you mean about the gentleman you murdered i believe that it were better for you if you were dead for i fancy it will go hard with you however that's none of my business i am sent to nurse you and get you well i do my duty with a safe conscience it were well if everybody did the same i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved on the very edge of death but i felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed the whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream i sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality as the images
110,hill here which rose as high into the heavens as the pond now sinks deep into the earth and they used much profanity as the story goes though this vice is one of which the indians were never guilty and while they were thus engaged the hill shook and suddenly sank and only one old squaw named escaped and from her the pond was named it has been conjectured that when the hill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present shore it is very certain at any rate that once there was no pond here and now there is one and this indian fable does not in any respect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom i have mentioned who remembers so well when he first came here with his diviningrod saw a thin vapor rising from the sward and the hazel pointed steadily downward and he concluded to dig a well here as for the stones many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for by the action of the waves on these hills but i observe that the surrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones so
111,that floated before me became more distinct i grew feverish a darkness pressed around me no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love no dear hand supported me the physician came and prescribed medicines and the old woman prepared them for me but utter carelessness was visible in the first and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee these were my first reflections but i soon learned that mr kirwin had shown me extreme kindness he had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me wretched indeed was the best and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse it is true he seldom came to see me for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer he came therefore sometimes to see that i was not neglected but his visits were short and with long intervals one day while i was gradually

113,recovering i was seated in a chair my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death i was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness at one time i considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law less innocent than poor justine had been such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and mr kirwin entered his countenance expressed sympathy and compassion he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in french i fear that this place is very shocking to you can i do anything to make you more comfortable i thank you but all that you mention is nothing to me on the whole earth there is no comfort which i am capable of receiving i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune but you will i hope soon quit this melancholy abode for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from

115,the criminal charge that is my least concern i am by a course of strange events become the most miserable of mortals persecuted and tortured as i am and have been can death be any evil to me nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred you were thrown by some surprising accident on this shore renowned for its hospitality seized immediately and charged with murder the first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed as it were by some fiend across your path as mr kirwin said this notwithstanding the agitation i endured on this retrospect of my sufferings i also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me i suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance for mr kirwin hastened to say immediately upon your being taken ill all the papers that were on your person were brought me and i examined them that i might discover some trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness i found several letters and among others
116,each weighing over two pounds shiners chivins or roach leuciscus pulchellus a very few breams and a couple of eels one weighing four poundsi am thus particular because the weight of a fish is commonly its only title to fame and these are the only eels i have heard of herealso i have a faint recollection of a little fish some five inches long with silvery sides and a greenish back somewhat dacelike in its character which i mention here chiefly to link my facts to fable nevertheless this pond is not very fertile in fish its pickerel though not abundant are its chief boast i have seen at one time lying on the ice pickerel of at least three different kinds a long and shallow one steelcolored most like those caught in the river a bright golden kind with greenish reflections and remarkably deep which is the most common here and another goldencolored and shaped like the last but peppered on the sides with small dark brown or black spots intermixed with a few faint bloodred ones very much like a trout the specific name reticulatus would not apply to this it should be guttatus rather these are all
117,one which i discovered from its commencement to be from your father i instantly wrote to geneva nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter but you are ill even now you tremble you are unfit for agitation of any kind this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event tell me what new scene of death has been acted and whose murder i am now to lament your family is perfectly well said mr kirwin with gentleness and someone a friend is come to visit you i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of clerval as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires i put my hand before my eyes and cried out in agony oh take him away i cannot see him for god's sake do not let him enter mr kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance he could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone i should

119,have thought young man that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance my father cried i while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure is my father indeed come how kind how very kind but where is he why does he not hasten to me my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence he rose and quitted the room with my nurse and in a moment my father entered it nothing at this moment could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father i stretched out my hand to him and cried are you then safeand elizabethand ernest my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart to raise my desponding spirits but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness what a place is this that you inhabit my son said he looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room you travelled
120,you may see from a boat in calm weather near the sandy eastern shore where the water is eight or ten feet deep and also in some other parts of the pond some circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by a foot in height consisting of small stones less than a hen's egg in size where all around is bare sand at first you wonder if the indians could have formed them on the ice for any purpose and so when the ice melted they sank to the bottom but they are too regular and some of them plainly too fresh for that they are similar to those found in rivers but as there are no suckers nor lampreys here i know not by what fish they could be made perhaps they are the nests of the chivin these lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom the shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous i have in my mind's eye the western indented with deep bays the bolder northern and the beautifully scalloped southern shore where successive capes overlap each other and suggest unexplored coves between the forest has never so good a setting nor is so
121,to seek happiness but a fatality seems to pursue you and poor clerval the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state i shed tears alas yes my father replied i some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me and i must live to fulfil it or surely i should have died on the coffin of henry we were not allowed to converse for any length of time for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity mr kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion but the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel and i gradually recovered my health as my sickness quitted me i was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate the image of clerval was forever before me ghastly and murdered more than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse alas why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life it was surely that i might fulfil my

123,destiny which is now drawing to a close soon oh very soon will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust and in executing the award of justice i shall also sink to rest then the appearance of death was distant although the wish was ever present to my thoughts and i often sat for hours motionless and speechless wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins the season of the assizes approached i had already been three months in prison and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held mr kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence i was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death the grand jury rejected the bill on its being proved that i was on the orkney islands at the hour the body of my friend was found and a fortnight
124,beach at the east end of the pond in a calm september afternoon when a slight haze makes the opposite shoreline indistinct i have seen whence came the expression the glassy surface of a lake when you invert your head it looks like a thread of finest gossamer stretched across the valley and gleaming against the distant pine woods separating one stratum of the atmosphere from another you would think that you could walk dry under it to the opposite hills and that the swallows which skim over might perch on it indeed they sometimes dive below this line as it were by mistake and are undeceived as you look over the pond westward you are obliged to employ both your hands to defend your eyes against the reflected as well as the true sun for they are equally bright and if between the two you survey its surface critically it is literally as smooth as glass except where the skater insects at equal intervals scattered over its whole extent by their motions in the sun produce the finest imaginable sparkle on it or perchance a duck plumes itself or as i have said a swallow skims so low as
125,after my removal i was liberated from prison my father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge that i was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country i did not participate in these feelings for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful the cup of life was poisoned forever and although the sun shone upon me as upon the happy and gay of heart i saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me sometimes they were the expressive eyes of henry languishing in death the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them sometimes it was the watery clouded eyes of the monster as i first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection he talked of geneva which i should soon visit of elizabeth and ernest but these words only drew deep groans from me sometimes indeed i felt a wish for happiness and thought with
126,to touch it it may be that in the distance a fish describes an arc of three or four feet in the air and there is one bright flash where it emerges and another where it strikes the water sometimes the whole silvery arc is revealed or here and there perhaps is a thistledown floating on its surface which the fishes dart at and so dimple it again it is like molten glass cooled but not congealed and the few motes in it are pure and beautiful like the imperfections in glass you may often detect a yet smoother and darker water separated from the rest as if by an invisible cobweb boom of the water nymphs resting on it from a hilltop you can see a fish leap in almost any part for not a pickerel or shiner picks an insect from this smooth surface but it manifestly disturbs the equilibrium of the whole lake it is wonderful with what elaborateness this simple fact is advertisedthis piscine murder will outand from my distant perch i distinguish the circling undulations when they are half a dozen rods in diameter you can even detect a waterbug gyrinus ceaselessly progressing over the
127,melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed with a devouring maladie du pays to see once more the blue lake and rapid rhone that had been so dear to me in early childhood but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the existence i loathed and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence yet one duty remained to me the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair it was necessary that i should return without delay to geneva there to watch over the lives of those i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment or if he dared again to blast me by his presence i might with unfailing aim put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the mockery of a soul still more
128,smooth surface a quarter of a mile off for they furrow the water slightly making a conspicuous ripple bounded by two diverging lines but the skaters glide over it without rippling it perceptibly when the surface is considerably agitated there are no skaters nor waterbugs on it but apparently in calm days they leave their havens and adventurously glide forth from the shore by short impulses till they completely cover it it is a soothing employment on one of those fine days in the fall when all the warmth of the sun is fully appreciated to sit on a stump on such a height as this overlooking the pond and study the dimpling circles which are incessantly inscribed on its otherwise invisible surface amid the reflected skies and trees over this great expanse there is no disturbance but it is thus at once gently smoothed away and assuaged as when a vase of water is jarred the trembling circles seek the shore and all is smooth again not a fish can leap or an insect fall on the pond but it is thus reported in circling dimples in lines of beauty as it were the constant welling up of its
129,monstrous my father still desired to delay our departure fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a journey for i was a shattered wreckthe shadow of a human being my strength was gone i was a mere skeleton and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame still as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatience my father thought it best to yield we took our passage on board a vessel bound for havredegrace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish shores it was midnight i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my sight and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should soon see geneva the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream yet the vessel in which i was the wind that blew me from the detested shore of ireland and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that i was deceived by no vision and that clerval my friend and dearest companion had fallen a victim to me and the

131,monster of my creation i repassed in my memory my whole lifemy quiet happiness while residing with my family in geneva the death of my mother and my departure for ingolstadt i remembered shuddering the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy and i called to mind the night in which he first lived i was unable to pursue the train of thought a thousand feelings pressed upon me and i wept bitterly ever since my recovery from the fever i had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum for it was by means of this drug only that i was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes i now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly but sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me towards morning i was possessed by a kind of nightmare i felt the fiend's grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it groans and cries rang in my ears my father who was watching

134,to distinguish its surface though it no longer reflected the bright tints of october but the sombre november colors of the surrounding hills though i passed over it as gently as possible the slight undulations produced by my boat extended almost as far as i could see and gave a ribbed appearance to the reflections but as i was looking over the surface i saw here and there at a distance a faint glimmer as if some skater insects which had escaped the frosts might be collected there or perchance the surface being so smooth betrayed where a spring welled up from the bottom paddling gently to one of these places i was surprised to find myself surrounded by myriads of small perch about five inches long of a rich bronze color in the green water sporting there and constantly rising to the surface and dimpling it sometimes leaving bubbles on it in such transparent and seemingly bottomless water reflecting the clouds i seemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon and their swimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering as if they were a compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level
135,each and all abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair sometimes he thought that i felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride alas my father said i how little do you know me human beings their feelings and passions would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as i felt pride justine poor unhappy justine was as innocent as i and she suffered the same charge she died for it and i am the cause of thisi murdered her william justine and henrythey all died by my hands my father had often during my imprisonment heard me make the same assertion when i thus accused myself he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium and that during my illness some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination the remembrance of which i
136,on the right or left their fins like sails set all around them there were many such schools in the pond apparently improving the short season before winter would draw an icy shutter over their broad skylight sometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight breeze struck it or a few raindrops fell there when i approached carelessly and alarmed them they made a sudden splash and rippling with their tails as if one had struck the water with a brushy bough and instantly took refuge in the depths at length the wind rose the mist increased and the waves began to run and the perch leaped much higher than before half out of water a hundred black points three inches long at once above the surface even as late as the fifth of december one year i saw some dimples on the surface and thinking it was going to rain hard immediately the air being full of mist i made haste to take my place at the oars and row homeward already the rain seemed rapidly increasing though i felt none on my cheek and i anticipated a thorough soaking but suddenly the dimples ceased for
137,preserved in my convalescence i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch i had created i had a persuasion that i should be supposed mad and this in itself would forever have chained my tongue but besides i could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast i checked therefore my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when i would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret yet still words like those i have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me i could offer no explanation of them but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe upon this occasion my father said with an expression of unbounded wonder my dearest victor what infatuation is this my dear son i entreat you never to make such an assertion again i am not mad i cried energetically the sun and the heavens who have viewed my operations can bear witness of my truth i am the assassin of those most innocent victims they died by my machinations a thousand times would i have shed my
138,they were produced by the perch which the noise of my oars had seared into the depths and i saw their schools dimly disappearing so i spent a dry afternoon after all an old man who used to frequent this pond nearly sixty years ago when it was dark with surrounding forests tells me that in those days he sometimes saw it all alive with ducks and other waterfowl and that there were many eagles about it he came here afishing and used an old log canoe which he found on the shore it was made of two white pine logs dug out and pinned together and was cut off square at the ends it was very clumsy but lasted a great many years before it became waterlogged and perhaps sank to the bottom he did not know whose it was it belonged to the pond he used to make a cable for his anchor of strips of hickory bark tied together an old man a potter who lived by the pond before the revolution told him once that there was an iron chest at the bottom and that he had seen it sometimes it would come floating up to
139,own blood drop by drop to have saved their lives but i could not my father indeed i could not sacrifice the whole human race the conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts he wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes as time passed away i became more calm misery had her dwelling in my heart but i no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes sufficient for me was the consciousness of them by the utmost selfviolence i curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice a few days before we left paris on our way to switzerland i received the following letter from elizabeth my dear friend it gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from

141,my uncle dated at paris you are no longer at a formidable distance and i may hope to see you in less than a fortnight my poor cousin how much you must have suffered i expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted geneva this winter has been passed most miserably tortured as i have been by anxious suspense yet i hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity yet i fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago even perhaps augmented by time i would not disturb you at this period when so many misfortunes weigh upon you but a conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet explanation you may possibly say what can elizabeth have to explain if you really say this my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied but you are distant from me and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation and in a probability of this being the case i dare
142,amphitheatre for some land of sylvan spectacle i have spent many an hour when i was younger floating over its surface as the zephyr willed having paddled my boat to the middle and lying on my back across the seats in a summer forenoon dreaming awake until i was aroused by the boat touching the sand and i arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to days when idleness was the most attractive and productive industry many a forenoon have i stolen away preferring to spend thus the most valued part of the day for i was rich if not in money in sunny hours and summer days and spent them lavishly nor do i regret that i did not waste more of them in the workshop or the teacher's desk but since i left those shores the woodchoppers have still further laid them waste and now for many a year there will be no more rambling through the aisles of the wood with occasional vistas through which you see the water my muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth how can you expect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down now

173,only did i lose recollection i fell senseless on the ground when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn their countenances expressed a breathless terror but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her and now as she lay her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck i might have supposed her asleep i rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished the murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips while i still hung over her in the agony of despair i happened to look up the windows of the room had before been darkened and i felt

219,progress as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me became every moment more ominous and terrific i pressed on but in vain the wind arose the sea roared and as with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work was soon finished in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death in this manner many appalling hours passed several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship i had determined if you were going southwards still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose
220,coarsely also but to tell the truth i find myself at present somewhat less particular in these respects i carry less religion to the table ask no blessing not because i am wiser than i was but i am obliged to confess because however much it is to be regretted with years i have grown more coarse and indifferent perhaps these questions are entertained only in youth as most believe of poetry my practice is nowhere my opinion is here nevertheless i am far from regarding myself as one of those privileged ones to whom the ved refers when it says that he who has true faith in the omnipresent supreme being may eat all that exists that is is not bound to inquire what is his food or who prepares it and even in their case it is to be observed as a hindoo commentator has remarked that the vedant limits this privilege to the time of distress who has not sometimes derived an inexpressible satisfaction from his food in which appetite had no share i have been thrilled to think that i owed a mental perception to the commonly gross sense of taste that i have been inspired
221,i hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which i could pursue my enemy but your direction was northwards you took me on board when my vigour was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the daemon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no i am not so selfish yet when i am dead if he should appear if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you swear that he shall not liveswear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes he is eloquent and persuasive and once his words had even power over my heart but trust him not his soul is as
222,through the palate that some berries which i had eaten on a hillside had fed my genius the soul not being mistress of herself says thsengtseu one looks and one does not see one listens and one does not hear one eats and one does not know the savor of food he who distinguishes the true savor of his food can never be a glutton he who does not cannot be otherwise a puritan may go to his brownbread crust with as gross an appetite as ever an alderman to his turtle not that food which entereth into the mouth defileth a man but the appetite with which it is eaten it is neither the quality nor the quantity but the devotion to sensual savors when that which is eaten is not a viand to sustain our animal or inspire our spiritual life but food for the worms that possess us if the hunter has a taste for mudturtles muskrats and other such savage tidbits the fine lady indulges a taste for jelly made of a calf's foot or for sardines from over the sea and they are even he goes to the millpond she to her preservepot the wonder

224,is how they how you and i can live this slimy beastly life eating and drinking our whole life is startlingly moral there is never an instant's truce between virtue and vice goodness is the only investment that never fails in the music of the harp which trembles round the world it is the insisting on this which thrills us the harp is the travelling patterer for the universe's insurance company recommending its laws and our little goodness is all the assessment that we pay though the youth at last grows indifferent the laws of the universe are not indifferent but are forever on the side of the most sensitive listen to every zephyr for some reproof for it is surely there and he is unfortunate who does not hear it we cannot touch a string or move a stop but the charming moral transfixes us many an irksome noise go a long way off is heard as music a proud sweet satire on the meanness of our lives we are conscious of an animal in us which awakens in proportion as our higher nature slumbers it is reptile and sensual and perhaps cannot be wholly expelled like the worms

256,sit still long enough in some attractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit themselves to you by turns i was witness to events of a less peaceful character one day when i went out to my woodpile or rather my pile of stumps i observed two large ants the one red the other much larger nearly half an inch long and black fiercely contending with one another having once got hold they never let go but struggled and wrestled and rolled on the chips incessantly looking farther i was surprised to find that the chips were covered with such combatants that it was not a duellum but a bellum a war between two races of ants the red always pitted against the black and frequently two red ones to one black the legions of these myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my woodyard and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying both red and black it was the only battle which i have ever witnessed the only battlefield i ever trod while the battle was raging internecine war the red republicans on the one hand and the black imperialists on the
257,without this final and wonderful catastrophe i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my illfated and admirable friend over him hung a form which i cannot find words to describegigantic in stature yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions as he hung over the coffin his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair but one vast hand was extended in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy when he heard the sound of my approach he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness i shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer i called on him to stay he paused looking on me with wonder and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator he seemed to forget my presence and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion that is also my victim he exclaimed in his murder my crimes are consummated the miserable series of my being is wound to its close oh
258,other on every side they were engaged in deadly combat yet without any noise that i could hear and human soldiers never fought so resolutely i watched a couple that were fast locked in each other's embraces in a little sunny valley amid the chips now at noonday prepared to fight till the sun went down or life went out the smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his adversary's front and through all the tumblings on that field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root having already caused the other to go by the board while the stronger black one dashed him from side to side and as i saw on looking nearer had already divested him of several of his members they fought with more pertinacity than bulldogs neither manifested the least disposition to retreat it was evident that their battlecry was conquer or die in the meanwhile there came along a single red ant on the hillside of this valley evidently full of excitement who either had despatched his foe or had not yet taken part in the battle probably the latter for he had lost
259,generous and selfdevoted being what does it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me i who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst alas he is cold he cannot answer me his voice seemed suffocated and my first impulses which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion i approached this tremendous being i dared not again raise my eyes to his face there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness i attempted to speak but the words died away on my lips the monster continued to utter wild and incoherent selfreproaches at length i gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion your repentance i said is now superfluous if you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity would yet have lived and do you dream said the daemon do you think that i was then dead to agony and remorse he he continued pointing to the corpse he suffered not in
260,none of his limbs whose mother had charged him to return with his shield or upon it or perchance he was some achilles who had nourished his wrath apart and had now come to avenge or rescue his patroclus he saw this unequal combat from afarfor the blacks were nearly twice the size of the redhe drew near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half an inch of the combatants then watching his opportunity he sprang upon the black warrior and commenced his operations near the root of his right fore leg leaving the foe to select among his own members and so there were three united for life as if a new kind of attraction had been invented which put all other locks and cements to shame i should not have wondered by this time to find that they had their respective musical bands stationed on some eminent chip and playing their national airs the while to excite the slow and cheer the dying combatants i was myself excited somewhat even as if they had been men the more you think of it the less the difference and certainly there is not the fight recorded
261,the consummation of the deed oh not the tenthousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution a frightful selfishness hurried me on while my heart was poisoned with remorse think you that the groans of clerval were music to my ears my heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland heartbroken and overcome i pitied my pity amounted to horror i abhorred myself but when i discovered that he the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments dared to hope for happiness that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which i was forever barred then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance i recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished i knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture but i was the slave not the
262,in concord history at least if in the history of america that will bear a moment's comparison with this whether for the numbers engaged in it or for the patriotism and heroism displayed for numbers and for carnage it was an austerlitz or dresden concord fight two killed on the patriots side and luther blanchard wounded why here every ant was a buttrickfire for god's sake fireand thousands shared the fate of davis and hosmer there was not one hireling there i have no doubt that it was a principle they fought for as much as our ancestors and not to avoid a threepenny tax on their tea and the results of this battle will be as important and memorable to those whom it concerns as those of the battle of bunker hill at least i took up the chip on which the three i have particularly described were struggling carried it into my house and placed it under a tumbler on my windowsill in order to see the issue holding a microscope to the firstmentioned red ant i saw that though he was assiduously gnawing at the near fore leg of his enemy having severed his remaining feeler his
263,master of an impulse which i detested yet could not disobey yet when she died nay then i was not miserable i had cast off all feeling subdued all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair evil thenceforth became my good urged thus far i had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly chosen the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion and now it is ended there is my last victim i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery yet when i called to mind what had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend indignation was rekindled within me wretch i said it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made you throw a torch into a pile of buildings and when they are consumed you sit among the ruins and lament the fall hypocritical fiend if he whom you mourn still lived still would he be the object again would he become the prey of your accursed vengeance it is not pity

273,or seen though his foes sweep the pond with spyglasses and make the woods resound with their discharges the waves generously rise and dash angrily taking sides with all waterfowl and our sportsmen must beat a retreat to town and shop and unfinished jobs but they were too often successful when i went to get a pail of water early in the morning i frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few rods if i endeavored to overtake him in a boat in order to see how he would manoeuvre he would dive and be completely lost so that i did not discover him again sometimes till the latter part of the day but i was more than a match for him on the surface he commonly went off in a rain as i was paddling along the north shore one very calm october afternoon for such days especially they settle on to the lakes like the milkweed down having looked in vain over the pond for a loon suddenly one sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods in front of me set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself i
274,pursued with a paddle and he dived but when he came up i was nearer than before he dived again but i miscalculated the direction he would take and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this time for i had helped to widen the interval and again he laughed long and loud and with more reason than before he manoeuvred so cunningly that i could not get within half a dozen rods of him each time when he came to the surface turning his head this way and that he cooly surveyed the water and the land and apparently chose his course so that he might come up where there was the widest expanse of water and at the greatest distance from the boat it was surprising how quickly he made up his mind and put his resolve into execution he led me at once to the widest part of the pond and could not be driven from it while he was thinking one thing in his brain i was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine it was a pretty game played on the smooth surface of the pond a man against a loon
275,suddenly your adversary's checker disappears beneath the board and the problem is to place yours nearest to where his will appear again sometimes he would come up unexpectedly on the opposite side of me having apparently passed directly under the boat so longwinded was he and so unweariable that when he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge again nevertheless and then no wit could divine where in the deep pond beneath the smooth surface he might be speeding his way like a fish for he had time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its deepest part it is said that loons have been caught in the new york lakes eighty feet beneath the surface with hooks set for troutthough is deeper than that how surprised must the fishes be to see this ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their schools yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on the surface and swam much faster there once or twice i saw a ripple where he approached the surface just put his head out to reconnoitre and instantly dived again i found that it was as well for me
276,to rest on my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where he would rise for again and again when i was straining my eyes over the surface one way i would suddenly be startled by his unearthly laugh behind me but why after displaying so much cunning did he invariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh did not his white breast enough betray him he was indeed a silly loon i thought i could commonly hear the splash of the water when he came up and so also detected him but after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever dived as willingly and swam yet farther than at first it was surprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast when he came to the surface doing all the work with his webbed feet beneath his usual note was this demoniac laughter yet somewhat like that of a waterfowl but occasionally when he had balked me most successfully and come up a long way off he uttered a longdrawn unearthly howl probably more like that of a wolf than any bird as when a beast puts his muzzle
277,to the ground and deliberately howls this was his looningperhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here making the woods ring far and wide i concluded that he laughed in derision of my efforts confident of his own resources though the sky was by this time overcast the pond was so smooth that i could see where he broke the surface when i did not hear him his white breast the stillness of the air and the smoothness of the water were all against him at length having come up fifty rods off he uttered one of those prolonged howls as if calling on the god of loons to aid him and immediately there came a wind from the east and rippled the surface and filled the whole air with misty rain and i was impressed as if it were the prayer of the loon answered and his god was angry with me and so i left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous surface for hours in fall days i watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer and hold the middle of the pond far from the sportsman tricks which they will have less need to practise in
278,louisiana bayous when compelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and over the pond at a considerable height from which they could easily see to other ponds and the river like black motes in the sky and when i thought they had gone off thither long since they would settle down by a slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which was left free but what beside safety they got by sailing in the middle of i do not know unless they love its water for the same reason that i do housewarming in october i went agraping to the river meadows and loaded myself with clusters more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for food there too i admired though i did not gather the cranberries small waxen gems pendants of the meadow grass pearly and red which the farmer plucks with an ugly rake leaving the smooth meadow in a snarl heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only and sells the spoils of the meads to boston and new york destined to be jammed to satisfy the tastes of lovers of nature there so butchers
279,rake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass regardless of the torn and drooping plant the barberry's brilliant fruit was likewise food for my eyes merely but i collected a small store of wild apples for coddling which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked when chestnuts were ripe i laid up half a bushel for winter it was very exciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of lincolnthey now sleep their long sleep under the railroadwith a bag on my shoulder and a stick to open burs with in my hand for i did not always wait for the frost amid the rustling of leaves and the loud reproofs of the red squirrels and the jays whose halfconsumed nuts i sometimes stole for the burs which they had selected were sure to contain sound ones occasionally i climbed and shook the trees they grew also behind my house and one large tree which almost overshadowed it was when in flower a bouquet which scented the whole neighborhood but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit the last coming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out of the
280,burs before they fell i relinquished these trees to them and visited the more distant woods composed wholly of chestnut these nuts as far as they went were a good substitute for bread many other substitutes might perhaps be found digging one day for fishworms i discovered the groundnut apios tuberosa on its string the potato of the aborigines a sort of fabulous fruit which i had begun to doubt if i had ever dug and eaten in childhood as i had told and had not dreamed it i had often since seen its crumpled red velvety blossom supported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be the same cultivation has wellnigh exterminated it it has a sweetish taste much like that of a frostbitten potato and i found it better boiled than roasted this tuber seemed like a faint promise of nature to rear her own children and feed them simply here at some future period in these days of fatted cattle and waving grainfields this humble root which was once the totem of an indian tribe is quite forgotten or known only by its flowering vine but let wild nature reign here once more and

282,distinguished by more brilliant or harmonious coloring for the old upon the walls the wasps came by thousands to my lodge in october as to winter quarters and settled on my windows within and on the walls overhead sometimes deterring visitors from entering each morning when they were numbed with cold i swept some of them out but i did not trouble myself much to get rid of them i even felt complimented by their regarding my house as a desirable shelter they never molested me seriously though they bedded with me and they gradually disappeared into what crevices i do not know avoiding winter and unspeakable cold like the wasps before i finally went into winter quarters in november i used to resort to the northeast side of which the sun reflected from the pitch pine woods and the stony shore made the fireside of the pond it is so much pleasanter and wholesomer to be warmed by the sun while you can be than by an artificial fire i thus warmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer like a departed hunter had left when i came to build my chimney i studied masonry my bricks
283,being secondhand ones required to be cleaned with a trowel so that i learned more than usual of the qualities of bricks and trowels the mortar on them was fifty years old and was said to be still growing harder but this is one of those sayings which men love to repeat whether they are true or not such sayings themselves grow harder and adhere more firmly with age and it would take many blows with a trowel to clean an old wiseacre of them many of the villages of mesopotamia are built of secondhand bricks of a very good quality obtained from the ruins of babylon and the cement on them is older and probably harder still however that may be i was struck by the peculiar toughness of the steel which bore so many violent blows without being worn out as my bricks had been in a chimney before though i did not read the name of nebuchadnezzar on them i picked out as many fireplace bricks as i could find to save work and waste and i filled the spaces between the bricks about the fireplace with stones from the pond shore and also made my mortar
284,with the white sand from the same place i lingered most about the fireplace as the most vital part of the house indeed i worked so deliberately that though i commenced at the ground in the morning a course of bricks raised a few inches above the floor served for my pillow at night yet i did not get a stiff neck for it that i remember my stiff neck is of older date i took a poet to board for a fortnight about those times which caused me to be put to it for room he brought his own knife though i had two and we used to scour them by thrusting them into the earth he shared with me the labors of cooking i was pleased to see my work rising so square and solid by degrees and reflected that if it proceeded slowly it was calculated to endure a long time the chimney is to some extent an independent structure standing on the ground and rising through the house to the heavens even after the house is burned it still stands sometimes and its importance and independence are apparent this was toward the end of summer it
285,was now november the north wind had already begun to cool the pond though it took many weeks of steady blowing to accomplish it it is so deep when i began to have a fire at evening before i plastered my house the chimney carried smoke particularly well because of the numerous chinks between the boards yet i passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy apartment surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots and rafters with the bark on high overhead my house never pleased my eye so much after it was plastered though i was obliged to confess that it was more comfortable should not every apartment in which man dwells be lofty enough to create some obscurity overhead where flickering shadows may play at evening about the rafters these forms are more agreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other the most expensive furniture i now first began to inhabit my house i may say when i began to use it for warmth as well as shelter i had got a couple of old firedogs to keep the wood from the hearth and it did me good to see the soot
286,form on the back of the chimney which i had built and i poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction than usual my dwelling was small and i could hardly entertain an echo in it but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from neighbors all the attractions of a house were concentrated in one room it was kitchen chamber parlor and keepingroom and whatever satisfaction parent or child master or servant derive from living in a house i enjoyed it all cato says the master of a family patremfamilias must have in his rustic villa cellam oleariam vinariam dolia multa uti lubeat caritatem expectare et rei et virtuti et gloriae erit that is an oil and wine cellar many casks so that it may be pleasant to expect hard times it will be for his advantage and virtue and glory i had in my cellar a firkin of potatoes about two quarts of peas with the weevil in them and on my shelf a little rice a jug of molasses and of rye and indian meal a peck each i sometimes dream of a larger and more populous house standing in a golden age

290,the parable of a dinner commonly as if only the savage dwelt near enough to nature and truth to borrow a trope from them how can the scholar who dwells away in the north west territory or the isle of man tell what is parliamentary in the kitchen however only one or two of my guests were ever bold enough to stay and eat a hastypudding with me but when they saw that crisis approaching they beat a hasty retreat rather as if it would shake the house to its foundations nevertheless it stood through a great many hastypuddings i did not plaster till it was freezing weather i brought over some whiter and cleaner sand for this purpose from the opposite shore of the pond in a boat a sort of conveyance which would have tempted me to go much farther if necessary my house had in the meanwhile been shingled down to the ground on every side in lathing i was pleased to be able to send home each nail with a single blow of the hammer and it was my ambition to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatly and rapidly i remembered the
291,story of a conceited fellow who in fine clothes was wont to lounge about the village once giving advice to workmen venturing one day to substitute deeds for words he turned up his cuffs seized a plasterer's board and having loaded his trowel without mishap with a complacent look toward the lathing overhead made a bold gesture thitherward and straightway to his complete discomfiture received the whole contents in his ruffled bosom i admired anew the economy and convenience of plastering which so effectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome finish and i learned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable i was surprised to see how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all the moisture in my plaster before i had smoothed it and how many pailfuls of water it takes to christen a new hearth i had the previous winter made a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the unio fluviatilis which our river affords for the sake of the experiment so that i knew where my materials came from i might have got good limestone within a mile or two and burned it myself if i had cared to
292,do so the pond had in the meanwhile skimmed over in the shadiest and shallowest coves some days or even weeks before the general freezing the first ice is especially interesting and perfect being hard dark and transparent and affords the best opportunity that ever offers for examining the bottom where it is shallow for you can lie at your length on ice only an inch thick like a skater insect on the surface of the water and study the bottom at your leisure only two or three inches distant like a picture behind a glass and the water is necessarily always smooth then there are many furrows in the sand where some creature has travelled about and doubled on its tracks and for wrecks it is strewn with the cases of caddisworms made of minute grains of white quartz perhaps these have creased it for you find some of their cases in the furrows though they are deep and broad for them to make but the ice itself is the object of most interest though you must improve the earliest opportunity to study it if you examine it closely the morning after it freezes you find that the greater
293,part of the bubbles which at first appeared to be within it are against its under surface and that more are continually rising from the bottom while the ice is as yet comparatively solid and dark that is you see the water through it these bubbles are from an eightieth to an eighth of an inch in diameter very clear and beautiful and you see your face reflected in them through the ice there may be thirty or forty of them to a square inch there are also already within the ice narrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long sharp cones with the apex upward or oftener if the ice is quite fresh minute spherical bubbles one directly above another like a string of beads but these within the ice are not so numerous nor obvious as those beneath i sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength of the ice and those which broke through carried in air with them which formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath one day when i came to the same place fortyeight hours afterward i found that those large bubbles were still perfect though an inch more of
294,ice had formed as i could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake but as the last two days had been very warm like an indian summer the ice was not now transparent showing the dark green color of the water and the bottom but opaque and whitish or gray and though twice as thick was hardly stronger than before for the air bubbles had greatly expanded under this heat and run together and lost their regularity they were no longer one directly over another but often like silvery coins poured from a bag one overlapping another or in thin flakes as if occupying slight cleavages the beauty of the ice was gone and it was too late to study the bottom being curious to know what position my great bubbles occupied with regard to the new ice i broke out a cake containing a middling sized one and turned it bottom upward the new ice had formed around and under the bubble so that it was included between the two ices it was wholly in the lower ice but close against the upper and was flattish or perhaps slightly lenticular with a rounded edge a
295,quarter of an inch deep by four inches in diameter and i was surprised to find that directly under the bubble the ice was melted with great regularity in the form of a saucer reversed to the height of five eighths of an inch in the middle leaving a thin partition there between the water and the bubble hardly an eighth of an inch thick and in many places the small bubbles in this partition had burst out downward and probably there was no ice at all under the largest bubbles which were a foot in diameter i inferred that the infinite number of minute bubbles which i had first seen against the under surface of the ice were now frozen in likewise and that each in its degree had operated like a burningglass on the ice beneath to melt and rot it these are the little airguns which contribute to make the ice crack and whoop at length the winter set in good earnest just as i had finished plastering and the wind began to howl around the house as if it had not had permission to do so till then night after night the geese came lumbering in
296,the dark with a clangor and a whistling of wings even after the ground was covered with snow some to alight in and some flying low over the woods toward fair haven bound for mexico several times when returning from the village at ten or eleven o'clock at night i heard the tread of a flock of geese or else ducks on the dry leaves in the woods by a pondhole behind my dwelling where they had come up to feed and the faint honk or quack of their leader as they hurried off in froze entirely over for the first time on the night of the 22d of december flint's and other shallower ponds and the river having been frozen ten days or more in the 16th in about the 31st and in about the 27th of december in the 5th of january in the 31st of december the snow had already covered the ground since the 25th of november and surrounded me suddenly with the scenery of winter i withdrew yet farther into my shell and endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and within my breast my employment out of doors now was to
297,collect the dead wood in the forest bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders or sometimes trailing a dead pine tree under each arm to my shed an old forest fence which had seen its best days was a great haul for me i sacrificed it to vulcan for it was past serving the god terminus how much more interesting an event is that man's supper who has just been forth in the snow to hunt nay you might say steal the fuel to cook it with his bread and meat are sweet there are enough fagots and waste wood of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns to support many fires but which at present warm none and some think hinder the growth of the young wood there was also the driftwood of the pond in the course of the summer i had discovered a raft of pitch pine logs with the bark on pinned together by the irish when the railroad was built this i hauled up partly on the shore after soaking two years and then lying high six months it was perfectly sound though waterlogged past drying i amused myself one
298,winter day with sliding this piecemeal across the pond nearly half a mile skating behind with one end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder and the other on the ice or i tied several logs together with a birch withe and then with a longer birch or alder which had a hook at the end dragged them across though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead they not only burned long but made a very hot fire nay i thought that they burned better for the soaking as if the pitch being confined by the water burned longer as in a lamp gilpin in his account of the forest borderers of england says that the encroachments of trespassers and the houses and fences thus raised on the borders of the forest were considered as great nuisances by the old forest law and were severely punished under the name of purprestures as tending ad terrorem ferarumad nocumentum forestae etc to the frightening of the game and the detriment of the forest but i was interested in the preservation of the venison and the vert more than the hunters or woodchoppers and as much as though i had
299,been the lord warden himself and if any part was burned though i burned it myself by accident i grieved with a grief that lasted longer and was more inconsolable than that of the proprietors nay i grieved when it was cut down by the proprietors themselves i would that our farmers when they cut down a forest felt some of that awe which the old romans did when they came to thin or let in the light to a consecrated grove lucum conlucare that is would believe that it is sacred to some god the roman made an expiatory offering and prayed whatever god or goddess thou art to whom this grove is sacred be propitious to me my family and children etc it is remarkable what a value is still put upon wood even in this age and in this new country a value more permanent and universal than that of gold after all our discoveries and inventions no man will go by a pile of wood it is as precious to us as it was to our saxon and norman ancestors if they made their bows of it we make our gunstocks of it michaux more than
300,thirty years ago says that the price of wood for fuel in new york and philadelphia nearly equals and sometimes exceeds that of the best wood in paris though this immense capital annually requires more than three hundred thousand cords and is surrounded to the distance of three hundred miles by cultivated plains in this town the price of wood rises almost steadily and the only question is how much higher it is to be this year than it was the last mechanics and tradesmen who come in person to the forest on no other errand are sure to attend the wood auction and even pay a high price for the privilege of gleaning after the woodchopper it is now many years that men have resorted to the forest for fuel and the materials of the arts the new englander and the new hollander the parisian and the celt the farmer and robin hood goody blake and harry gill in most parts of the world the prince and the peasant the scholar and the savage equally require still a few sticks from the forest to warm them and cook their food neither could i do without them every man looks
301,at his woodpile with a kind of affection i love to have mine before my window and the more chips the better to remind me of my pleasing work i had an old axe which nobody claimed with which by spells in winter days on the sunny side of the house i played about the stumps which i had got out of my beanfield as my driver prophesied when i was plowing they warmed me twiceonce while i was splitting them and again when they were on the fire so that no fuel could give out more heat as for the axe i was advised to get the village blacksmith to jump it but i jumped him and putting a hickory helve from the woods into it made it do if it was dull it was at least hung true a few pieces of fat pine were a great treasure it is interesting to remember how much of this food for fire is still concealed in the bowels of the earth in previous years i had often gone prospecting over some bare hillside where a pitch pine wood had formerly stood and got out the fat pine roots they are
302,almost indestructible stumps thirty or forty years old at least will still be sound at the core though the sapwood has all become vegetable mould as appears by the scales of the thick bark forming a ring level with the earth four or five inches distant from the heart with axe and shovel you explore this mine and follow the marrowy store yellow as beef tallow or as if you had struck on a vein of gold deep into the earth but commonly i kindled my fire with the dry leaves of the forest which i had stored up in my shed before the snow came green hickory finely split makes the woodchopper's kindlings when he has a camp in the woods once in a while i got a little of this when the villagers were lighting their fires beyond the horizon i too gave notice to the various wild inhabitants of vale by a smoky streamer from my chimney that i was awake lightwinged smoke icarian bird melting thy pinions in thy upward flight lark without song and messenger of dawn circling above the hamlets as thy nest or else departing dream and shadowy form of midnight vision gathering
303,up thy skirts by night starveiling and by day darkening the light and blotting out the sun go thou my incense upward from this hearth and ask the gods to pardon this clear flame hard green wood just cut though i used but little of that answered my purpose better than any other i sometimes left a good fire when i went to take a walk in a winter afternoon and when i returned three or four hours afterward it would be still alive and glowing my house was not empty though i was gone it was as if i had left a cheerful housekeeper behind it was i and fire that lived there and commonly my housekeeper proved trustworthy one day however as i was splitting wood i thought that i would just look in at the window and see if the house was not on fire it was the only time i remember to have been particularly anxious on this score so i looked and saw that a spark had caught my bed and i went in and extinguished it when it had burned a place as big as my hand but my house occupied so sunny and
304,sheltered a position and its roof was so low that i could afford to let the fire go out in the middle of almost any winter day the moles nested in my cellar nibbling every third potato and making a snug bed even there of some hair left after plastering and of brown paper for even the wildest animals love comfort and warmth as well as man and they survive the winter only because they are so careful to secure them some of my friends spoke as if i was coming to the woods on purpose to freeze myself the animal merely makes a bed which he warms with his body in a sheltered place but man having discovered fire boxes up some air in a spacious apartment and warms that instead of robbing himself makes that his bed in which he can move about divested of more cumbrous clothing maintain a kind of summer in the midst of winter and by means of windows even admit the light and with a lamp lengthen out the day thus he goes a step or two beyond instinct and saves a little time for the fine arts though when i had been
305,exposed to the rudest blasts a long time my whole body began to grow torpid when i reached the genial atmosphere of my house i soon recovered my faculties and prolonged my life but the most luxuriously housed has little to boast of in this respect nor need we trouble ourselves to speculate how the human race may be at last destroyed it would be easy to cut their threads any time with a little sharper blast from the north we go on dating from cold fridays and great snows but a little colder friday or greater snow would put a period to man's existence on the globe the next winter i used a small cookingstove for economy since i did not own the forest but it did not keep fire so well as the open fireplace cooking was then for the most part no longer a poetic but merely a chemic process it will soon be forgotten in these days of stoves that we used to roast potatoes in the ashes after the indian fashion the stove not only took up room and scented the house but it concealed the fire and i felt as if i had lost
306,a companion you can always see a face in the fire the laborer looking into it at evening purifies his thoughts of the dross and earthiness which they have accumulated during the day but i could no longer sit and look into the fire and the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me with new force never bright flame may be denied to me thy dear life imaging close sympathy what but my hopes shot upward e'er so bright what but my fortunes sunk so low in night why art thou banished from our hearth and hall thou who art welcomed and beloved by all was thy existence then too fanciful for our life's common light who are so dull did thy bright gleam mysterious converse hold with our congenial souls secrets too bold well we are safe and strong for now we sit beside a hearth where no dim shadows flit where nothing cheers nor saddens but a fire warms feet and handsnor does to more aspire by whose compact utilitarian heap the present may sit down and go to sleep nor fear the ghosts who from the dim past walked and with us by the unequal light
307,of the old wood fire talked former inhabitants and winter visitors i weathered some merry snowstorms and spent some cheerful winter evenings by my fireside while the snow whirled wildly without and even the hooting of the owl was hushed for many weeks i met no one in my walks but those who came occasionally to cut wood and sled it to the village the elements however abetted me in making a path through the deepest snow in the woods for when i had once gone through the wind blew the oak leaves into my tracks where they lodged and by absorbing the rays of the sun melted the snow and so not only made a my bed for my feet but in the night their dark line was my guide for human society i was obliged to conjure up the former occupants of these woods within the memory of many of my townsmen the road near which my house stands resounded with the laugh and gossip of inhabitants and the woods which border it were notched and dotted here and there with their little gardens and dwellings though it was then much more shut in by the forest than
308,now in some places within my own remembrance the pines would scrape both sides of a chaise at once and women and children who were compelled to go this way to lincoln alone and on foot did it with fear and often ran a good part of the distance though mainly but a humble route to neighboring villages or for the woodman's team it once amused the traveller more than now by its variety and lingered longer in his memory where now firm open fields stretch from the village to the woods it then ran through a maple swamp on a foundation of logs the remnants of which doubtless still underlie the present dusty highway from the stratton now the almshouse farm to brister's hill east of my beanfield across the road lived cato ingraham slave of duncan ingraham esquire gentleman of concord village who built his slave a house and gave him permission to live in woodscato not uticensis but concordiensis some say that he was a guinea negro there are a few who remember his little patch among the walnuts which he let grow up till he should be old and need them but a younger and whiter

310,oncethere where grow still the apple trees which brister planted and tended large old trees now but their fruit still wild and ciderish to my taste not long since i read his epitaph in the old lincoln buryingground a little on one side near the unmarked graves of some british grenadiers who fell in the retreat from concordwhere he is styled sippio bristerscipio africanus he had some title to be calleda man of color as if he were discolored it also told me with staring emphasis when he died which was but an indirect way of informing me that he ever lived with him dwelt fenda his hospitable wife who told fortunes yet pleasantlylarge round and black blacker than any of the children of night such a dusky orb as never rose on concord before or since farther down the hill on the left on the old road in the woods are marks of some homestead of the stratton family whose orchard once covered all the slope of brister's hill but was long since killed out by pitch pines excepting a few stumps whose old roots furnish still the wild stocks of many a thrifty village tree nearer yet to
311,town you come to breed's location on the other side of the way just on the edge of the wood ground famous for the pranks of a demon not distinctly named in old mythology who has acted a prominent and astounding part in our new england life and deserves as much as any mythological character to have his biography written one day who first comes in the guise of a friend or hired man and then robs and murders the whole familynewengland rum but history must not yet tell the tragedies enacted here let time intervene in some measure to assuage and lend an azure tint to them here the most indistinct and dubious tradition says that once a tavern stood the well the same which tempered the traveller's beverage and refreshed his steed here then men saluted one another and heard and told the news and went their ways again breed's hut was standing only a dozen years ago though it had long been unoccupied it was about the size of mine it was set on fire by mischievous boys one election night if i do not mistake i lived on the edge of the village then and had
312,just lost myself over davenant's gondibert that winter that i labored with a lethargywhich by the way i never knew whether to regard as a family complaint having an uncle who goes to sleep shaving himself and is obliged to sprout potatoes in a cellar sundays in order to keep awake and keep the sabbath or as the consequence of my attempt to read chalmers collection of english poetry without skipping it fairly overcame my nervii i had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung fire and in hot haste the engines rolled that way led by a straggling troop of men and boys and i among the foremost for i had leaped the brook we thought it was far south over the woodswe who had run to fires beforebarn shop or dwellinghouse or all together it's baker's barn cried one it is the codman place affirmed another and then fresh sparks went up above the wood as if the roof fell in and we all shouted concord to the rescue wagons shot past with furious speed and crushing loads bearing perchance among the rest the agent of the insurance company who was bound to go however
313,far and ever and anon the engine bell tinkled behind more slow and sure and rearmost of all as it was afterward whispered came they who set the fire and gave the alarm thus we kept on like true idealists rejecting the evidence of our senses until at a turn in the road we heard the crackling and actually felt the heat of the fire from over the wall and realized alas that we were there the very nearness of the fire but cooled our ardor at first we thought to throw a frogpond on to it but concluded to let it burn it was so far gone and so worthless so we stood round our engine jostled one another expressed our sentiments through speakingtrumpets or in lower tone referred to the great conflagrations which the world has witnessed including bascom's shop and between ourselves we thought that were we there in season with our tub and a full frogpond by we could turn that threatened last and universal one into another flood we finally retreated without doing any mischiefreturned to sleep and gondibert but as for gondibert i would except that passage in the preface about wit being the
314,soul's powderbut most of mankind are strangers to wit as indians are to powder it chanced that i walked that way across the fields the following night about the same hour and hearing a low moaning at this spot i drew near in the dark and discovered the only survivor of the family that i know the heir of both its virtues and its vices who alone was interested in this burning lying on his stomach and looking over the cellar wall at the still smouldering cinders beneath muttering to himself as is his wont he had been working far off in the river meadows all day and had improved the first moments that he could call his own to visit the home of his fathers and his youth he gazed into the cellar from all sides and points of view by turns always lying down to it as if there was some treasure which he remembered concealed between the stones where there was absolutely nothing but a heap of bricks and ashes the house being gone he looked at what there was left he was soothed by the sympathy which my mere presence implied and showed me as well
315,as the darkness permitted where the well was covered up which thank heaven could never be burned and he groped long about the wall to find the wellsweep which his father had cut and mounted feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a burden had been fastened to the heavy endall that he could now cling toto convince me that it was no common rider i felt it and still remark it almost daily in my walks for by it hangs the history of a family once more on the left where are seen the well and lilac bushes by the wall in the now open field lived nutting and le grosse but to return toward lincoln farther in the woods than any of these where the road approaches nearest to the pond wyman the potter squatted and furnished his townsmen with earthenware and left descendants to succeed him neither were they rich in worldly goods holding the land by sufferance while they lived and there often the sheriff came in vain to collect the taxes and attached a chip for form's sake as i have read in his accounts there being nothing else that he could lay
316,his hands on one day in midsummer when i was hoeing a man who was carrying a load of pottery to market stopped his horse against my field and inquired concerning wyman the younger he had long ago bought a potter's wheel of him and wished to know what had become of him i had read of the potter's clay and wheel in scripture but it had never occurred to me that the pots we use were not such as had come down unbroken from those days or grown on trees like gourds somewhere and i was pleased to hear that so fictile an art was ever practiced in my neighborhood the last inhabitant of these woods before me was an irishman hugh quoil if i have spelt his name with coil enough who occupied wyman's tenementcol quoil he was called rumor said that he had been a soldier at waterloo if he had lived i should have made him fight his battles over again his trade here was that of a ditcher napoleon went to st helena quoil came to woods all i know of him is tragic he was a man of manners like one who had seen
317,the world and was capable of more civil speech than you could well attend to he wore a greatcoat in midsummer being affected with the trembling delirium and his face was the color of carmine he died in the road at the foot of brister's hill shortly after i came to the woods so that i have not remembered him as a neighbor before his house was pulled down when his comrades avoided it as an unlucky castle i visited it there lay his old clothes curled up by use as if they were himself upon his raised plank bed his pipe lay broken on the hearth instead of a bowl broken at the fountain the last could never have been the symbol of his death for he confessed to me that though he had heard of brister's spring he had never seen it and soiled cards kings of diamonds spades and hearts were scattered over the floor one black chicken which the administrator could not catch black as night and as silent not even croaking awaiting reynard still went to roost in the next apartment in the rear there was the dim outline of a garden which had been
318,planted but had never received its first hoeing owing to those terrible shaking fits though it was now harvest time it was overrun with roman wormwood and beggarticks which last stuck to my clothes for all fruit the skin of a woodchuck was freshly stretched upon the back of the house a trophy of his last waterloo but no warm cap or mittens would he want more now only a dent in the earth marks the site of these dwellings with buried cellar stones and strawberries raspberries thimbleberries hazelbushes and sumachs growing in the sunny sward there some pitch pine or gnarled oak occupies what was the chimney nook and a sweetscented black birch perhaps waves where the doorstone was sometimes the well dent is visible where once a spring oozed now dry and tearless grass or it was covered deepnot to be discovered till some late daywith a flat stone under the sod when the last of the race departed what a sorrowful act must that bethe covering up of wells coincident with the opening of wells of tears these cellar dents like deserted fox burrows old holes are all that is left where once were the stir and
319,bustle of human life and fate free will foreknowledge absolute in some form and dialect or other were by turns discussed but all i can learn of their conclusions amounts to just this that cato and brister pulled wool which is about as edifying as the history of more famous schools of philosophy still grows the vivacious lilac a generation after the door and lintel and the sill are gone unfolding its sweetscented flowers each spring to be plucked by the musing traveller planted and tended once by children's hands in frontyard plotsnow standing by wallsides in retired pastures and giving place to newrising foreststhe last of that stirp sole survivor of that family little did the dusky children think that the puny slip with its two eyes only which they stuck in the ground in the shadow of the house and daily watered would root itself so and outlive them and house itself in the rear that shaded it and grown man's garden and orchard and tell their story faintly to the lone wanderer a halfcentury after they had grown up and diedblossoming as fair and smelling as sweet as in that first spring i mark its still tender

321,be destroyed with such reminiscences i repeopled the woods and lulled myself asleep at this season i seldom had a visitor when the snow lay deepest no wanderer ventured near my house for a week or fortnight at a time but there i lived as snug as a meadow mouse or as cattle and poultry which are said to have survived for a long time buried in drifts even without food or like that early settler's family in the town of sutton in this state whose cottage was completely covered by the great snow of 1717 when he was absent and an indian found it only by the hole which the chimney's breath made in the drift and so relieved the family but no friendly indian concerned himself about me nor needed he for the master of the house was at home the great snow how cheerful it is to hear of when the farmers could not get to the woods and swamps with their teams and were obliged to cut down the shade trees before their houses and when the crust was harder cut off the trees in the swamps ten feet from the ground as it appeared the
322,next spring in the deepest snows the path which i used from the highway to my house about half a mile long might have been represented by a meandering dotted line with wide intervals between the dots for a week of even weather i took exactly the same number of steps and of the same length coming and going stepping deliberately and with the precision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracksto such routine the winter reduces usyet often they were filled with heaven's own blue but no weather interfered fatally with my walks or rather my going abroad for i frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech tree or a yellow birch or an old acquaintance among the pines when the ice and snow causing their limbs to droop and so sharpening their tops had changed the pines into fir trees wading to the tops of the highest hills when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level and shaking down another snowstorm on my head at every step or sometimes creeping and floundering thither on my hands and knees when the hunters had
323,gone into winter quarters one afternoon i amused myself by watching a barred owl strix nebulosa sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of a white pine close to the trunk in broad daylight i standing within a rod of him he could hear me when i moved and cronched the snow with my feet but could not plainly see me when i made most noise he would stretch out his neck and erect his neck feathers and open his eyes wide but their lids soon fell again and he began to nod i too felt a slumberous influence after watching him half an hour as he sat thus with his eyes half open like a cat winged brother of the cat there was only a narrow slit left between their lids by which he preserved a peninsular relation to me thus with halfshut eyes looking out from the land of dreams and endeavoring to realize me vague object or mote that interrupted his visions at length on some louder noise or my nearer approach he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his perch as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed and when he launched himself
324,off and flapped through the pines spreading his wings to unexpected breadth i could not hear the slightest sound from them thus guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their neighborhood than by sight feeling his twilight way as it were with his sensitive pinions he found a new perch where he might in peace await the dawning of his day as i walked over the long causeway made for the railroad through the meadows i encountered many a blustering and nipping wind for nowhere has it freer play and when the frost had smitten me on one cheek heathen as i was i turned to it the other also nor was it much better by the carriage road from brister's hill for i came to town still like a friendly indian when the contents of the broad open fields were all piled up between the walls of the road and half an hour sufficed to obliterate the tracks of the last traveller and when i returned new drifts would have formed through which i floundered where the busy northwest wind had been depositing the powdery snow round a sharp angle in the road and not
325,a rabbit's track nor even the fine print the small type of a meadow mouse was to be seen yet i rarely failed to find even in midwinter some warm and springly swamp where the grass and the skunkcabbage still put forth with perennial verdure and some hardier bird occasionally awaited the return of spring sometimes notwithstanding the snow when i returned from my walk at evening i crossed the deep tracks of a woodchopper leading from my door and found his pile of whittlings on the hearth and my house filled with the odor of his pipe or on a sunday afternoon if i chanced to be at home i heard the cronching of the snow made by the step of a longheaded farmer who from far through the woods sought my house to have a social crack one of the few of his vocation who are men on their farms who donned a frock instead of a professor's gown and is as ready to extract the moral out of church or state as to haul a load of manure from his barnyard we talked of rude and simple times when men sat about large fires in cold bracing
326,weather with clear heads and when other dessert failed we tried our teeth on many a nut which wise squirrels have long since abandoned for those which have the thickest shells are commonly empty the one who came from farthest to my lodge through deepest snows and most dismal tempests was a poet a farmer a hunter a soldier a reporter even a philosopher may be daunted but nothing can deter a poet for he is actuated by pure love who can predict his comings and goings his business calls him out at all hours even when doctors sleep we made that small house ring with boisterous mirth and resound with the murmur of much sober talk making amends then to vale for the long silences broadway was still and deserted in comparison at suitable intervals there were regular salutes of laughter which might have been referred indifferently to the lastuttered or the forthcoming jest we made many a bran new theory of life over a thin dish of gruel which combined the advantages of conviviality with the clearheadedness which philosophy requires i should not forget that during my last winter at the pond there was another welcome visitor who
327,at one time came through the village through snow and rain and darkness till he saw my lamp through the trees and shared with me some long winter evenings one of the last of the philosophersconnecticut gave him to the worldhe peddled first her wares afterwards as he declares his brains these he peddles still prompting god and disgracing man bearing for fruit his brain only like the nut its kernel i think that he must be the man of the most faith of any alive his words and attitude always suppose a better state of things than other men are acquainted with and he will be the last man to be disappointed as the ages revolve he has no venture in the present but though comparatively disregarded now when his day comes laws unsuspected by most will take effect and masters of families and rulers will come to him for advice how blind that cannot see serenity a true friend of man almost the only friend of human progress an old mortality say rather an immortality with unwearied patience and faith making plain the image engraven in men's bodies the god of whom they are but defaced and leaning
328,monuments with his hospitable intellect he embraces children beggars insane and scholars and entertains the thought of all adding to it commonly some breadth and elegance i think that he should keep a caravansary on the world's highway where philosophers of all nations might put up and on his sign should be printed entertainment for man but not for his beast enter ye that have leisure and a quiet mind who earnestly seek the right road he is perhaps the sanest man and has the fewest crotchets of any i chance to know the same yesterday and tomorrow of yore we had sauntered and talked and effectually put the world behind us for he was pledged to no institution in it freeborn ingenuus whichever way we turned it seemed that the heavens and the earth had met together since he enhanced the beauty of the landscape a bluerobed man whose fittest roof is the overarching sky which reflects his serenity i do not see how he can ever die nature cannot spare him having each some shingles of thought well dried we sat and whittled them trying our knives and admiring the clear yellowish grain of the pumpkin pine we
329,waded so gently and reverently or we pulled together so smoothly that the fishes of thought were not scared from the stream nor feared any angler on the bank but came and went grandly like the clouds which float through the western sky and the mothero'pearl flocks which sometimes form and dissolve there there we worked revising mythology rounding a fable here and there and building castles in the air for which earth offered no worthy foundation great looker great expecter to converse with whom was a new england night's entertainment ah such discourse we had hermit and philosopher and the old settler i have spoken ofwe threeit expanded and racked my little house i should not dare to say how many pounds weight there was above the atmospheric pressure on every circular inch it opened its seams so that they had to be calked with much dulness thereafter to stop the consequent leakbut i had enough of that kind of oakum already picked there was one other with whom i had solid seasons long to be remembered at his house in the village and who looked in upon me from time to time but i had no more for
330,society there there too as everywhere i sometimes expected the visitor who never comes the vishnu purana says the householder is to remain at eventide in his courtyard as long as it takes to milk a cow or longer if he pleases to await the arrival of a guest i often performed this duty of hospitality waited long enough to milk a whole herd of cows but did not see the man approaching from the town winter animals when the ponds were firmly frozen they afforded not only new and shorter routes to many points but new views from their surfaces of the familiar landscape around them when i crossed flint's pond after it was covered with snow though i had often paddled about and skated over it it was so unexpectedly wide and so strange that i could think of nothing but baffin's bay the lincoln hills rose up around me at the extremity of a snowy plain in which i did not remember to have stood before and the fishermen at an indeterminable distance over the ice moving slowly about with their wolfish dogs passed for sealers or esquimaux or in misty weather loomed like fabulous creatures and
331,i did not know whether they were giants or pygmies i took this course when i went to lecture in lincoln in the evening travelling in no road and passing no house between my own hut and the lecture room in goose pond which lay in my way a colony of muskrats dwelt and raised their cabins high above the ice though none could be seen abroad when i crossed it being like the rest usually bare of snow or with only shallow and interrupted drifts on it was my yard where i could walk freely when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level elsewhere and the villagers were confined to their streets there far from the village street and except at very long intervals from the jingle of sleighbells i slid and skated as in a vast mooseyard well trodden overhung by oak woods and solemn pines bent down with snow or bristling with icicles for sounds in winter nights and often in winter days i heard the forlorn but melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far such a sound as the frozen earth would yield if struck with a suitable plectrum the very lingua
332,vernacula of wood and quite familiar to me at last though i never saw the bird while it was making it i seldom opened my door in a winter evening without hearing it hoo hoo hoo hoorer hoo sounded sonorously and the first three syllables accented somewhat like how der do or sometimes hoo hoo only one night in the beginning of winter before the pond froze over about nine o'clock i was startled by the loud honking of a goose and stepping to the door heard the sound of their wings like a tempest in the woods as they flew low over my house they passed over the pond toward fair haven seemingly deterred from settling by my light their commodore honking all the while with a regular beat suddenly an unmistakable catowl from very near me with the most harsh and tremendous voice i ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods responded at regular intervals to the goose as if determined to expose and disgrace this intruder from hudson's bay by exhibiting a greater compass and volume of voice in a native and boohoo him out of concord horizon what do you mean by alarming the citadel
333,at this time of night consecrated to me do you think i am ever caught napping at such an hour and that i have not got lungs and a larynx as well as yourself boohoo boohoo boohoo it was one of the most thrilling discords i ever heard and yet if you had a discriminating ear there were in it the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw nor heard i also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond my great bedfellow in that part of concord as if it were restless in its bed and would fain turn over were troubled with flatulency and had dreams or i was waked by the cracking of the ground by the frost as if some one had driven a team against my door and in the morning would find a crack in the earth a quarter of a mile long and a third of an inch wide sometimes i heard the foxes as they ranged over the snowcrust in moonlight nights in search of a partridge or other game barking raggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs as if laboring with some anxiety or seeking expression struggling for
334,light and to be dogs outright and run freely in the streets for if we take the ages into our account may there not be a civilization going on among brutes as well as men they seemed to me to be rudimental burrowing men still standing on their defence awaiting their transformation sometimes one came near to my window attracted by my light barked a vulpine curse at me and then retreated usually the red squirrel sciurus hudsonius waked me in the dawn coursing over the roof and up and down the sides of the house as if sent out of the woods for this purpose in the course of the winter i threw out half a bushel of ears of sweet corn which had not got ripe on to the snowcrust by my door and was amused by watching the motions of the various animals which were baited by it in the twilight and the night the rabbits came regularly and made a hearty meal all day long the red squirrels came and went and afforded me much entertainment by their manoeuvres one would approach at first warily through the shrub oaks running over the snowcrust by fits and
335,starts like a leaf blown by the wind now a few paces this way with wonderful speed and waste of energy making inconceivable haste with his trotters as if it were for a wager and now as many paces that way but never getting on more than half a rod at a time and then suddenly pausing with a ludicrous expression and a gratuitous somerset as if all the eyes in the universe were eyed on himfor all the motions of a squirrel even in the most solitary recesses of the forest imply spectators as much as those of a dancing girlwasting more time in delay and circumspection than would have sufficed to walk the whole distancei never saw one walkand then suddenly before you could say jack robinson he would be in the top of a young pitch pine winding up his clock and chiding all imaginary spectators soliloquizing and talking to all the universe at the same timefor no reason that i could ever detect or he himself was aware of i suspect at length he would reach the corn and selecting a suitable ear frisk about in the same uncertain trigonometrical way to the topmost stick of
336,my woodpile before my window where he looked me in the face and there sit for hours supplying himself with a new ear from time to time nibbling at first voraciously and throwing the halfnaked cobs about till at length he grew more dainty still and played with his food tasting only the inside of the kernel and the ear which was held balanced over the stick by one paw slipped from his careless grasp and fell to the ground when he would look over at it with a ludicrous expression of uncertainty as if suspecting that it had life with a mind not made up whether to get it again or a new one or be off now thinking of corn then listening to hear what was in the wind so the little impudent fellow would waste many an ear in a forenoon till at last seizing some longer and plumper one considerably bigger than himself and skilfully balancing it he would set out with it to the woods like a tiger with a buffalo by the same zigzag course and frequent pauses scratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and falling all the
337,while making its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular and horizontal being determined to put it through at any ratea singularly frivolous and whimsical fellowand so he would get off with it to where he lived perhaps carry it to the top of a pine tree forty or fifty rods distant and i would afterwards find the cobs strewn about the woods in various directions at length the jays arrive whose discordant screams were heard long before as they were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile off and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree nearer and nearer and pick up the kernels which the squirrels have dropped then sitting on a pitch pine bough they attempt to swallow in their haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokes them and after great labor they disgorge it and spend an hour in the endeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills they were manifestly thieves and i had not much respect for them but the squirrels though at first shy went to work as if they were taking what was their own meanwhile also came the
338,chickadees in flocks which picking up the crumbs the squirrels had dropped flew to the nearest twig and placing them under their claws hammered away at them with their little bills as if it were an insect in the bark till they were sufficiently reduced for their slender throats a little flock of these titmice came daily to pick a dinner out of my woodpile or the crumbs at my door with faint flitting lisping notes like the tinkling of icicles in the grass or else with sprightly day day day or more rarely in springlike days a wiry summery phebe from the woodside they were so familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which i was carrying in and pecked at the sticks without fear i once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while i was hoeing in a village garden and i felt that i was more distinguished by that circumstance than i should have been by any epaulet i could have worn the squirrels also grew at last to be quite familiar and occasionally stepped upon my shoe when that was the nearest way when the ground was not
339,yet quite covered and again near the end of winter when the snow was melted on my south hillside and about my woodpile the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to feed there whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge bursts away on whirring wings jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs on high which comes sifting down in the sunbeams like golden dust for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter it is frequently covered up by drifts and it is said sometimes plunges from on wing into the soft snow where it remains concealed for a day or two i used to start them in the open land also where they had come out of the woods at sunset to bud the wild apple trees they will come regularly every evening to particular trees where the cunning sportsman lies in wait for them and the distant orchards next the woods suffer thus not a little i am glad that the partridge gets fed at any rate it is nature's own bird which lives on buds and diet drink in dark winter mornings or in short winter afternoons i
340,sometimes heard a pack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and yelp unable to resist the instinct of the chase and the note of the huntinghorn at intervals proving that man was in the rear the woods ring again and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level of the pond nor following pack pursuing their acton and perhaps at evening i see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from their sleigh for a trophy seeking their inn they tell me that if the fox would remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would be safe or if he would run in a straight line away no foxhound could overtake him but having left his pursuers far behind he stops to rest and listen till they come up and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts where the hunters await him sometimes however he will run upon a wall many rods and then leap off far to one side and he appears to know that water will not retain his scent a hunter told me that he once saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to
341,when the ice was covered with shallow puddles run part way across and then return to the same shore ere long the hounds arrived but here they lost the scent sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my door and circle round my house and yelp and hound without regarding me as if afflicted by a species of madness so that nothing could divert them from the pursuit thus they circle until they fall upon the recent trail of a fox for a wise hound will forsake everything else for this one day a man came to my hut from lexington to inquire after his hound that made a large track and had been hunting for a week by himself but i fear that he was not the wiser for all i told him for every time i attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me by asking what do you do here he had lost a dog but found a man one old hunter who has a dry tongue who used to come to bathe in once every year when the water was warmest and at such times looked in upon me told me that many years ago
342,he took his gun one afternoon and went out for a cruise in wood and as he walked the wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching and ere long a fox leaped the wall into the road and as quick as thought leaped the other wall out of the road and his swift bullet had not touched him some way behind came an old hound and her three pups in full pursuit hunting on their own account and disappeared again in the woods late in the afternoon as he was resting in the thick woods south of he heard the voice of the hounds far over toward fair haven still pursuing the fox and on they came their hounding cry which made all the woods ring sounding nearer and nearer now from well meadow now from the baker farm for a long time he stood still and listened to their music so sweet to a hunter's ear when suddenly the fox appeared threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace whose sound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves swift and still keeping the round leaving his pursuers far behind and leaping upon a rock
343,city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was saul and they stoned stephen calling upon and saying lord receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria except the apostles and devout men carried stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him as for saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prison therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached unto them and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken
344,amid the woods he sat erect and listening with his back to the hunter for a moment compassion restrained the latter's arm but that was a shortlived mood and as quick as thought can follow thought his piece was levelled and whangthe fox rolling over the rock lay dead on the ground the hunter still kept his place and listened to the hounds still on they came and now the near woods resounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry at length the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground and snapping the air as if possessed and ran directly to the rock but spying the dead fox she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb with amazement and walked round and round him in silence and one by one her pups arrived and like their mother were sobered into silence by the mystery then the hunter came forward and stood in their midst and the mystery was solved they waited in silence while he skinned the fox then followed the brush a while and at length turned off into the woods again that evening a weston squire came to the concord hunter's cottage to
345,with palsies and that were lame were healed and there was great joy in that city but there was a certain man called simon which beforetime in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of and the name of they were baptized both men and women then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of they sent unto them peter and who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy
346,inquire for his hounds and told how for a week they had been hunting on their own account from weston woods the concord hunter told him what he knew and offered him the skin but the other declined it and departed he did not find his hounds that night but the next day learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farmhouse for the night whence having been well fed they took their departure early in the morning the hunter who told me this could remember one sam nutting who used to hunt bears on fair haven ledges and exchange their skins for rum in concord village who told him even that he had seen a moose there nutting had a famous foxhound named burgoynehe pronounced it buginewhich my informant used to borrow in the wast book of an old trader of this town who was also a captain townclerk and representative i find the following entry jan 18th john melven cr by grey fox they are not now found here and in his ledger feb 7th hezekiah stratton has credit by a catt skin of course a wildcat for stratton was a sergeant in the
347,ghost and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the holy ghost was given he offered them money saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of may be purchased with money thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity then answered simon and said pray ye to the lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me and they when they had testified and preached the word of the lord returned to jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans and the angel of the lord spake unto philip saying arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza which is desert and he arose

360,tell much less than they have done the things which they practice are said not yet to be known here is one fishing for pickerel with grown perch for bait you look into his pail with wonder as into a summer pond as if he kept summer locked up at home or knew where she had retreated how pray did he get these in midwinter oh he got worms out of rotten logs since the ground froze and so he caught them his life itself passes deeper in nature than the studies of the naturalist penetrate himself a subject for the naturalist the latter raises the moss and bark gently with his knife in search of insects the former lays open logs to their core with his axe and moss and bark fly far and wide he gets his living by barking trees such a man has some right to fish and i love to see nature carried out in him the perch swallows the grubworm the pickerel swallows the perch and the fisherman swallows the pickerel and so all the chinks in the scale of being are filled when i strolled around the pond in misty weather i was
361,her in an upper chamber and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppa and the disciples had heard that peter was there they sent unto him two men desiring him that he would not delay to come to them then peter arose and went with them when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made while she was with them but peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turning him to the body said tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw peter she sat up and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the saints and widows presented her alive and it was known throughout all joppa and many believed in the lord and it came to pass that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tanner 1there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurion of the band called the italian band 1a devout man and one that feared with all his house which gave much alms to the people
362,sometimes amused by the primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted he would perhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice which were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from the shore and having fastened the end of the line to a stick to prevent its being pulled through have passed the slack line over a twig of the alder a foot or more above the ice and tied a dry oak leaf to it which being pulled down would show when he had a bite these alders loomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked half way round the pond ah the pickerel of when i see them lying on the ice or in the well which the fisherman cuts in the ice making a little hole to admit the water i am always surprised by their rare beauty as if they were fabulous fishes they are so foreign to the streets even to the woods foreign as arabia to our concord life they possess a quite dazzling and transcendent beauty which separates them by a wide interval from the cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is trumpeted in
363,and prayed to alway 1he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of coming in to him and saying unto him cornelius 1and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before 1and now send men to joppa and call for one simon whose surname is peter 1he lodgeth with one simon a tanner whose house is by the sea side he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do 1and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually 1and when he had declared all these things unto them he sent them to joppa 1on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh unto the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance and saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending upon him as
364,our streets they are not green like the pines nor gray like the stones nor blue like the sky but they have to my eyes if possible yet rarer colors like flowers and precious stones as if they were the pearls the animalized nuclei or crystals of the water they of course are all over and all through are themselves small s in the animal kingdom ses it is surprising that they are caught herethat in this deep and capacious spring far beneath the rattling teams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the road this great gold and emerald fish swims i never chanced to see its kind in any market it would be the cynosure of all eyes there easily with a few convulsive quirks they give up their watery ghosts like a mortal translated before his time to the thin air of heaven as i was desirous to recover the long lost bottom of pond i surveyed it carefully before the ice broke up early in with compass and chain and sounding line there have been many stories told about the bottom or rather no bottom of this pond which certainly had no foundation for themselves it
365,it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air and there came a voice to him rise peter kill and eat but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean and the voice spake unto him again the second time what hath cleansed that call not thou common this was done thrice and the vessel was received up again into heaven now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from cornelius had made enquiry for simon's house and stood before the gate and called and asked whether simon which was surnamed peter were lodged there while peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto him behold three men seek thee arise therefore and get thee down and go with them doubting nothing for i have sent them then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius and said behold i am he whom
366,is remarkable how long men will believe in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound it i have visited two such bottomless ponds in one walk in this neighborhood many have believed that reached quite through to the other side of the globe some who have lain flat on the ice for a long time looking down through the illusive medium perchance with watery eyes into the bargain and driven to hasty conclusions by the fear of catching cold in their breasts have seen vast holes into which a load of hay might be driven if there were anybody to drive it the undoubted source of the styx and entrance to the infernal regions from these parts others have gone down from the village with a fiftysix and a wagon load of inch rope but yet have failed to find any bottom for while the fiftysix was resting by the way they were paying out the rope in the vain attempt to fathom their truly immeasurable capacity for marvellousness but i can assure my readers that has a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable though at an unusual depth i fathomed it easily with a
367,ye seek what is the cause wherefore ye are come and they said cornelius the centurion a just man and one that feareth and of good report among all the nation of the jews was warned from by an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee then called he them in and lodged them and on the morrow peter went away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him and the morrow after they entered into caesarea and cornelius waited for them and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends and as peter was coming in cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come together and he said unto them ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation but hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean therefore came i unto you without

369,gainsaying as soon as i was sent for i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me and cornelius said four days ago i was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing and said cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of send therefore to joppa and call hither simon whose surname is peter he is lodged in the house of one simon a tanner by the sea side who when he cometh shall speak unto thee immediately therefore i sent to thee and thou hast well done that thou art come now therefore are we all here present before to hear all things that are commanded thee of then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him the word which sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by he is lord of all that word i say ye know which was published throughout all judaea and began

372,a horrid chasm from which the waters have receded though it requires the insight and the far sight of the geologist to convince the unsuspecting inhabitants of this fact often an inquisitive eye may detect the shores of a primitive lake in the low horizon hills and no subsequent elevation of the plain have been necessary to conceal their history but it is easiest as they who work on the highways know to find the hollows by the puddles after a shower the amount of it is the imagination give it the least license dives deeper and soars higher than nature goes so probably the depth of the ocean will be found to be very inconsiderable compared with its breadth as i sounded through the ice i could determine the shape of the bottom with greater accuracy than is possible in surveying harbors which do not freeze over and i was surprised at its general regularity in the deepest part there are several acres more level than almost any field which is exposed to the sun wind and plow in one instance on a line arbitrarily chosen the depth did not vary more than one foot in thirty rods and
373,with tongues and magnify then answered peter can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord then prayed they him to tarry certain days 1and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of 1and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with him 1saying thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them 1but peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it by order unto them saying 1i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision a certain vessel descend as it had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and it came even to me 1upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes i considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air 1and i heard a voice saying unto me arise peter slay and eat 1but i said not so
374,generally near the middle i could calculate the variation for each one hundred feet in any direction beforehand within three or four inches some are accustomed to speak of deep and dangerous holes even in quiet sandy ponds like this but the effect of water under these circumstances is to level all inequalities the regularity of the bottom and its conformity to the shores and the range of the neighboring hills were so perfect that a distant promontory betrayed itself in the soundings quite across the pond and its direction could be determined by observing the opposite shore cape becomes bar and plain shoal and valley and gorge deep water and channel when i had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch and put down the soundings more than a hundred in all i observed this remarkable coincidence having noticed that the number indicating the greatest depth was apparently in the centre of the map i laid a rule on the map lengthwise and then breadthwise and found to my surprise that the line of greatest length intersected the line of greatest breadth exactly at the point of greatest depth notwithstanding that the middle is
375,lord for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth 1but the voice answered me again from heaven what hath cleansed that call not thou common and this was done three times and all were drawn up again into heaven and behold immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was sent from caesarea unto me and the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting moreover these six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the man's house and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house which stood and said unto him send men to joppa and call for simon whose surname is peter who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost forasmuch then as gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord what was i that i could withstand
376,so nearly level the outline of the pond far from regular and the extreme length and breadth were got by measuring into the coves and i said to myself who knows but this hint would conduct to the deepest part of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddle is not this the rule also for the height of mountains regarded as the opposite of valleys we know that a hill is not highest at its narrowest part of five coves three or all which had been sounded were observed to have a bar quite across their mouths and deeper water within so that the bay tended to be an expansion of water within the land not only horizontally but vertically and to form a basin or independent pond the direction of the two capes showing the course of the bar every harbor on the seacoast also has its bar at its entrance in proportion as the mouth of the cove was wider compared with its length the water over the bar was deeper compared with that in the basin given then the length and breadth of the cove and the character of the surrounding shore and you
377,when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified saying then hath also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice and cyprus and antioch preaching the word to none but unto the jews only and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene which when they were come to antioch spake unto the grecians preaching the lord and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the lord then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas that he should go as far as antioch who when he came and had seen the grace of was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord for he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faith and much people was added unto the lord then departed barnabas to tarsus for to seek saul and when he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came to
378,have almost elements enough to make out a formula for all cases in order to see how nearly i could guess with this experience at the deepest point in a pond by observing the outlines of a surface and the character of its shores alone i made a plan of white pond which contains about fortyone acres and like this has no island in it nor any visible inlet or outlet and as the line of greatest breadth fell very near the line of least breadth where two opposite capes approached each other and two opposite bays receded i ventured to mark a point a short distance from the latter line but still on the line of greatest length as the deepest the deepest part was found to be within one hundred feet of this still farther in the direction to which i had inclined and was only one foot deeper namely sixty feet of course a stream running through or an island in the pond would make the problem much more complicated if we knew all the laws of nature we should need only one fact or the description of one actual phenomenon to infer all the particular results
379,pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called ians first in antioch and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar then the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul 1now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church 1and he killed the brother of with the sword 1and because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further to take peter also then were the days of unleavened bread 1and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people 1peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church
380,at that point now we know only a few laws and our result is vitiated not of course by any confusion or irregularity in nature but by our ignorance of essential elements in the calculation our notions of law and harmony are commonly confined to those instances which we detect but the harmony which results from a far greater number of seemingly conflicting but really concurring laws which we have not detected is still more wonderful the particular laws are as our points of view as to the traveller a mountain outline varies with every step and it has an infinite number of profiles though absolutely but one form even when cleft or bored through it is not comprehended in its entireness what i have observed of the pond is no less true in ethics it is the law of average such a rule of the two diameters not only guides us toward the sun in the system and the heart in man but draws lines through the length and breadth of the aggregate of a man's particular daily behaviors and waves of life into his coves and inlets and where they intersect will be the height or depth of

382,his character perhaps we need only to know how his shores trend and his adjacent country or circumstances to infer his depth and concealed bottom if he is surrounded by mountainous circumstances an achillean shore whose peaks overshadow and are reflected in his bosom they suggest a corresponding depth in him but a low and smooth shore proves him shallow on that side in our bodies a bold projecting brow falls off to and indicates a corresponding depth of thought also there is a bar across the entrance of our every cove or particular inclination each is our harbor for a season in which we are detained and partially landlocked these inclinations are not whimsical usually but their form size and direction are determined by the promontories of the shore the ancient axes of elevation when this bar is gradually increased by storms tides or currents or there is a subsidence of the waters so that it reaches to the surface that which was at first but an inclination in the shore in which a thought was harbored becomes an individual lake cut off from the ocean wherein the thought secures its own conditionschanges perhaps from salt to fresh becomes

384,a sweet sea dead sea or a marsh at the advent of each individual into this life may we not suppose that such a bar has risen to the surface somewhere it is true we are such poor navigators that our thoughts for the most part stand off and on upon a harborless coast are conversant only with the bights of the bays of poesy or steer for the public ports of entry and go into the dry docks of science where they merely refit for this world and no natural currents concur to individualize them as for the inlet or outlet of i have not discovered any but rain and snow and evaporation though perhaps with a thermometer and a line such places may be found for where the water flows into the pond it will probably be coldest in summer and warmest in winter when the icemen were at work here in the cakes sent to the shore were one day rejected by those who were stacking them up there not being thick enough to lie side by side with the rest and the cutters thus discovered that the ice over a small space was two or three

388,an inch though the ice appeared firmly attached to the shore it was probably greater in the middle who knows but if our instruments were delicate enough we might detect an undulation in the crust of the earth when two legs of my level were on the shore and the third on the ice and the sights were directed over the latter a rise or fall of the ice of an almost infinitesimal amount made a difference of several feet on a tree across the pond when i began to cut holes for sounding there were three or four inches of water on the ice under a deep snow which had sunk it thus far but the water began immediately to run into these holes and continued to run for two days in deep streams which wore away the ice on every side and contributed essentially if not mainly to dry the surface of the pond for as the water ran in it raised and floated the ice this was somewhat like cutting a hole in the bottom of a ship to let the water out when such holes freeze and a rain succeeds and finally a new freezing forms

394,in the midst of a hard winter they went to work at once plowing barrowing rolling furrowing in admirable order as if they were bent on making this a model farm but when i was looking sharp to see what kind of seed they dropped into the furrow a gang of fellows by my side suddenly began to hook up the virgin mould itself with a peculiar jerk clean down to the sand or rather the waterfor it was a very springy soilindeed all the terra firma there wasand haul it away on sleds and then i guessed that they must be cutting peat in a bog so they came and went every day with a peculiar shriek from the locomotive from and to some point of the polar regions as it seemed to me like a flock of arctic snowbirds but sometimes squaw had her revenge and a hired man walking behind his team slipped through a crack in the ground down toward tartarus and he who was so brave before suddenly became but the ninth part of a man almost gave up his animal heat and was glad to take refuge in my house and acknowledged that there

397,of and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against paul and barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto iconium and

399,the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy ghost 1and it came to pass in iconium that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews and so spake that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed 1but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made their minds evil affected against the brethren 1long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord which gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands 1but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the jews and part with the apostles 1and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them 1they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about 1and there they preached the gospel 1and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a cripple from his mother's womb who never had walked 1the same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and

401,perceiving that he had faith to be healed said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked and when the people saw what paul had done they lifted up their voices saying in the speech of lycaonia the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he was the chief speaker then the priest of jupiter which was before their city brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with the people which when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out and saying sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are therein who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and

524,nogovernment men i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect and that will be one step toward obtaining it after all the practical reason why when the power is once in the hands of the people a majority are permitted and for a long period continue to rule is not because they are most likely to be in the right nor because this seems fairest to the minority but because they are physically the strongest but a government in which the majority rule in all cases cannot be based on justice even as far as men understand it can there not be a government in which majorities do not virtually decide right and wrong but consciencein which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency is applicable must the citizen ever for a moment or in the least degree resign his conscience to the legislator why has every man a conscience then i think that we should be men first and subjects afterward it is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law so much as for

532,the government when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable but almost all say that such is not the case now but such was the case they think in the revolution of if one were to tell me that this was a bad government because it taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports it is most probable that i should not make an ado about it for i can do without them all machines have their friction and possibly this does enough good to counterbalance the evil at any rate it is a great evil to make a stir about it but when the friction comes to have its machine and oppression and robbery are organized i say let us not have such a machine any longer in other words when a sixth of the population of a nation which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves and a whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army and subjected to military law i think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize what makes this duty the more urgent is the fact that the country so

534,overrun is not our own but ours is the invading army paley a common authority with many on moral questions in his chapter on the duty of submission to civil government resolves all civil obligation into expediency and he proceeds to say that so long as the interest of the whole society requires it that is so long as the established government cannot be resisted or changed without public inconveniency it is the will of god that the established government be obeyed and no longer this principle being admitted the justice of every particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of the quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side and of the probability and expense of redressing it on the other of this he says every man shall judge for himself but paley appears never to have contemplated those cases to which the rule of expediency does not apply in which a people as well as an individual must do justice cost what it may if i have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowning man i must restore it to him though i drown myself this according to paley would be inconvenient but he

536,that would save his life in such a case shall lose it this people must cease to hold slaves and to make war on mexico though it cost them their existence as a people in their practice nations agree with paley but does any one think that massachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis a drab of state a clotho'silver slut to have her train borne up and her soul trail in the dirt practically speaking the opponents to a reform in massachusetts are not a hundred thousand politicians at the south but a hundred thousand merchants and farmers here who are more interested in commerce and agriculture than they are in humanity and are not prepared to do justice to the slave and to mexico cost what it may i quarrel not with faroff foes but with those who near at home cooperate with and do the bidding of those far away and without whom the latter would be harmless we are accustomed to say that the mass of men are unprepared but improvement is slow because the few are not materially wiser or better than the many it is not so important that many should

538,be as good as you as that there be some absolute goodness somewhere for that will leaven the whole lump there are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and to the war who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them who esteeming themselves children of washington and franklin sit down with their hands in their pockets and say that they know not what to do and do nothing who even postpone the question of freedom to the question of freetrade and quietly read the pricescurrent along with the latest advices from mexico after dinner and it may be fall asleep over them both what is the pricecurrent of an honest man and patriot today they hesitate and they regret and sometimes they petition but they do nothing in earnest and with effect they will wait well disposed for others to remedy the evil that they may no longer have it to regret at most they give only a cheap vote and a feeble countenance and godspeed to the right as it goes by them there are nine hundred and ninetynine patrons of virtue to one virtuous man but it is easier to deal with

540,the real possessor of a thing than with the temporary guardian of it all voting is a sort of gaming like checkers or backgammon with a slight moral tinge to it a playing with right and wrong with moral questions and betting naturally accompanies it the character of the voters is not staked i cast my vote perchance as i think right but i am not vitally concerned that that right should prevail i am willing to leave it to the majority its obligation therefore never exceeds that of expediency even voting for the right is doing nothing for it it is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail a wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority there is but little virtue in the action of masses of men when the majority shall at length vote for the abolition of slavery it will be because they are indifferent to slavery or because there is but little slavery left to be abolished by their vote they will then be the only slaves only his vote can hasten the abolition of slavery

542,who asserts his own freedom by his vote i hear of a convention to be held at baltimore or elsewhere for the selection of a candidate for the presidency made up chiefly of editors and men who are politicians by profession but i think what is it to any independent intelligent and respectable man what decision they may come to shall we not have the advantage of his wisdom and honesty nevertheless can we not count upon some independent votes are there not many individuals in the country who do not attend conventions but no i find that the respectable man so called has immediately drifted from his position and despairs of his country when his country has more reason to despair of him he forthwith adopts one of the candidates thus selected as the only available one thus proving that he is himself available for any purposes of the demagogue his vote is of no more worth than that of any unprincipled foreigner or hireling native who may have been bought oh for a man who is a man and as my neighbor says has a bone in his back which you cannot pass your hand through our statistics
543,is counted for righteousness even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which

545,are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also

549,blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in through our lord by whom we have now received the atonement wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come but not as the offence so also is the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of and the gift by grace which is by one man hath abounded unto many and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offences

551,unto justification for if by one man's offence death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered that the offence might abound but where sin abounded grace did much more abound that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by our lord what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness
552,anticipate and provide for reform why does it not cherish its wise minority why does it cry and resist before it is hurt why does it not encourage its citizens to be on the alert to point out its faults and do better than it would have them why does it always crucify christ and excommunicate copernicus and luther and pronounce washington and franklin rebels one would think that a deliberate and practical denial of its authority was the only offence never contemplated by government else why has it not assigned its definite its suitable and proportionate penalty if a man who has no property refuses but once to earn nine shillings for the state he is put in prison for a period unlimited by any law that i know and determined only by the discretion of those who placed him there but if he should steal ninety times nine shillings from the state he is soon permitted to go at large again if the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government let it go let it go perchance it will wear smoothcertainly the machine will wear out if the injustice has a spring or

555,are not under the law but under grace forbid know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousness what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin and become servants to ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of is eternal life through our lord know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know
556,they should not hear my petition what should i do then but in this case the state has provided no way its very constitution is the evil this may seem to be harsh and stubborn and unconciliatory but it is to treat with the utmost kindness and consideration the only spirit that can appreciate or deserves it so is any change for the better like birth and death which convulse the body i do not hesitate to say that those who call themselves abolitionists should at once effectually withdraw their support both in person and property from the government of massachusetts and not wait till they constitute a majority of one before they suffer the right to prevail through them i think that it is enough if they have god on their side without waiting for that other one moreover any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already i meet this american government or its representative the state government directly and face to face once a yearno morein the person of its taxgatherer this is the only mode in which a man situated as i am necessarily meets it and it then says distinctly recognize
557,the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter what shall we say then is the law sin
558,me and the simplest the most effectual and in the present posture of affairs the indispensablest mode of treating with it on this head of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it is to deny it then my civil neighbor the taxgatherer is the very man i have to deal withfor it is after all with men and not with parchment that i quarreland he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government how shall he ever know well what he is and does as an officer of the government or as a man until he is obliged to consider whether he shall treat me his neighbor for whom he has respect as a neighbor and welldisposed man or as a maniac and disturber of the peace and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action i know this well that if one thousand if one hundred if ten men whom i could nameif ten honest men onlyay if one honest man in this state of massachusetts ceasing to hold slaves were actually to withdraw from this copartnership and be
559,forbid nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence for without the law sin was dead for i was alive without the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and i died and the commandment which was ordained to life i found to be unto death for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good was then that which is good made death unto me forbid but sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good now then
560,locked up in the county jail therefor it would be the abolition of slavery in america for it matters not how small the beginning may seem to be what is once well done is done forever but we love better to talk about it that we say is our mission reform keeps many scores of newspapers in its service but not one man if my esteemed neighbor the state's ambassador who will devote his days to the settlement of the question of human rights in the council chamber instead of being threatened with the prisons of carolina were to sit down the prisoner of massachusetts that state which is so anxious to foist the sin of slavery upon her sisterthough at present she can discover only an act of inhospitality to be the ground of a quarrel with herthe legislature would not wholly waive the subject the following winter under a government which imprisons any unjustly the true place for a just man is also a prison the proper place today the only place which massachusetts has provided for her freer and less desponding spirits is in her prisons to be put out and locked out of the state by
561,it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank through our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of but with the flesh the law of sin there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in who walk not after
562,her own act as they have already put themselves out by their principles it is there that the fugitive slave and the mexican prisoner on parole and the indian come to plead the wrongs of his race should find them on that separate but more free and honorable ground where the state places those who are not with her but against herthe only house in a slave state in which a free man can abide with honor if any think that their influence would be lost there and their voices no longer afflict the ear of the state that they would not be as an enemy within its walls they do not know by how much truth is stronger than error nor how much more eloquently and effectively he can combat injustice who has experienced a little in his own person cast your whole vote not a strip of paper merely but your whole influence a minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority it is not even a minority then but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight if the alternative is to keep all just men in prison or give up war and slavery
563,the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against for it is not subject to the law of neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of he is none of his and if be in you the body is dead because of sin but
564,the state will not hesitate which to choose if a thousand men were not to pay their taxbills this year that would not be a violent and bloody measure as it would be to pay them and enable the state to commit violence and shed innocent blood this is in fact the definition of a peaceable revolution if any such is possible if the taxgatherer or any other public officer asks me as one has done but what shall i do my answer is if you really wish to do anything resign your office when the subject has refused allegiance and the officer has resigned his office then the revolution is accomplished but even suppose blood should flow is there not a sort of blood shed when the conscience is wounded through this wound a man's real manhood and immortality flow out and he bleeds to an everlasting death i see this blood flowing now i have contemplated the imprisonment of the offender rather than the seizure of his goodsthough both will serve the same purposebecause they who assert the purest right and consequently are most dangerous to a corrupt state commonly have not spent much time in accumulating property
565,the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up from the dead dwell in you he that raised up from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of they are the sons of for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of and if children then heirs heirs of and jointheirs with if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons
566,to such the state renders comparatively small service and a slight tax is wont to appear exorbitant particularly if they are obliged to earn it by special labor with their hands if there were one who lived wholly without the use of money the state itself would hesitate to demand it of him but the rich mannot to make any invidious comparisonis always sold to the institution which makes him rich absolutely speaking the more money the less virtue for money comes between a man and his objects and obtains them for him and it was certainly no great virtue to obtain it it puts to rest many questions which he would otherwise be taxed to answer while the only new question which it puts is the hard but superfluous one how to spend it thus his moral ground is taken from under his feet the opportunities of living are diminished in proportion as what are called the means are increased the best thing a man can do for his culture when he is rich is to endeavor to carry out those schemes which he entertained when he was poor christ answered the herodians according to their condition show me
567,of for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of and we know that all things work together for

571,all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of which is in our lord i say the truth in i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for i could wish that myself were accursed from for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh came who is over all blessed for ever amen not as though the word of hath taken none effect for they are not all israel which are of israel neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of
572,life it costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty of disobedience to the state than it would to obey i should feel as if i were worth less in that case some years ago the state met me in behalf of the church and commanded me to pay a certain sum toward the support of a clergyman whose preaching my father attended but never i myself pay it said or be locked up in the jail i declined to pay but unfortunately another man saw fit to pay it i did not see why the schoolmaster should be taxed to support the priest and not the priest the schoolmaster for i was not the state's schoolmaster but i supported myself by voluntary subscription i did not see why the lyceum should not present its taxbill and have the state to back its demand as well as the church however at the request of the selectmen i condescended to make some such statement as this in writingknow all men by these presents that i do not wish to be regarded as a member of any incorporated society which i have not joined this i gave to the town

574,clerk and he has it the state having thus learned that i did not wish to be regarded as a member of that church has never made a like demand on me since though it said that it must adhere to its original presumption that time if i had known how to name them i should then have signed off in detail from all the societies which i never signed on to but i did not know where to find a complete list i have paid no polltax for six years i was put into a jail once on this account for one night and as i stood considering the walls of solid stone two or three feet thick the door of wood and iron a foot thick and the iron grating which strained the light i could not help being struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated me as if i were mere flesh and blood and bones to be locked up i wondered that it should have concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way i saw
575,therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth thou wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will nay but o man who art thou that repliest against shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour what if willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles as he saith also in osee i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the living
576,that if there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen there was a still more difficult one to climb or break through before they could get to be as free as i was i did not for a moment feel confined and the walls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar i felt as if i alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax they plainly did not know how to treat me but behaved like persons who are underbred in every threat and in every compliment there was a blunder for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other side of that stone wall i could not but smile to see how industriously they locked the door on my meditations which followed them out again without let or hindrance and they were really all that was dangerous as they could not reach me they had resolved to punish my body just as boys if they cannot come at some person against whom they have a spite will abuse his dog i saw that the state was halfwitted that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons and that
577,esaias also crieth concerning israel though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth and as esaias said before except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha what shall we say then that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumblingstone as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed 1brethren my heart's desire and prayer to for israel is that they might be saved 1for i bear them record that they have a zeal of but not according to knowledge 1for they being ignorant of s
578,it did not know its friends from its foes and i lost all my remaining respect for it and pitied it thus the state never intentionally confronts a man's sense intellectual or moral but only his body his senses it is not armed with superior wit or honesty but with superior physical strength i was not born to be forced i will breathe after my own fashion let us see who is the strongest what force has a multitude they only can force me who obey a higher law than i they force me to become like themselves i do not hear of men being forced to have this way or that by masses of men what sort of life were that to live when i meet a government which says to me your money or your life why should i be in haste to give it my money it may be in a great strait and not know what to do i cannot help that it must help itself do as i do it is not worth the while to snivel about it i am not responsible for the successful working of the machinery of society i am not

580,the son of the engineer i perceive that when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side the one does not remain inert to make way for the other but both obey their own laws and spring and grow and flourish as best they can till one perchance overshadows and destroys the other if a plant cannot live according to its nature it dies and so a man the night in prison was novel and interesting enough the prisoners in their shirtsleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in the doorway when i entered but the jailer said come boys it is time to lock up and so they dispersed and i heard the sound of their steps returning into the hollow apartments my roommate was introduced to me by the jailer as a firstrate fellow and a clever man when the door was locked he showed me where to hang my hat and how he managed matters there the rooms were whitewashed once a month and this one at least was the whitest most simply furnished and probably the neatest apartment in the town he naturally wanted to know where i came from and what brought

582,me there and when i had told him i asked him in my turn how he came there presuming him to be an honest man of course and as the world goes i believe he was why said he they accuse me of burning a barn but i never did it as near as i could discover he had probably gone to bed in a barn when drunk and smoked his pipe there and so a barn was burnt he had the reputation of being a clever man had been there some three months waiting for his trial to come on and would have to wait as much longer but he was quite domesticated and contented since he got his board for nothing and thought that he was well treated he occupied one window and i the other and i saw that if one stayed there long his principal business would be to look out the window i had soon read all the tracts that were left there and examined where former prisoners had broken out and where a grate had been sawed off and heard the history of the various occupants of that room for i found that even
583,all day long i have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people 1i say then hath cast away his people forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin 1 hath not cast away his people which he foreknew wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to against israel saying 1lord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life 1but what saith the answer of unto him i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal 1even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace 1and if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise work is no more work 1what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded 1according as it is written hath given them the spirit
584,here there was a history and a gossip which never circulated beyond the walls of the jail probably this is the only house in the town where verses are composed which are afterward printed in a circular form but not published i was shown quite a long list of verses which were composed by some young men who had been detected in an attempt to escape who avenged themselves by singing them i pumped my fellowprisoner as dry as i could for fear i should never see him again but at length he showed me which was my bed and left me to blow out the lamp it was like travelling into a far country such as i had never expected to behold to lie there for one night it seemed to me that i never had heard the townclock strike before nor the evening sounds of the village for we slept with the windows open which were inside the grating it was to see my native village in the light of the middle ages and our concord was turned into a rhine stream and visions of knights and castles passed before me they were the voices of old burghers

586,that i heard in the streets i was an involuntary spectator and auditor of whatever was done and said in the kitchen of the adjacent villageinna wholly new and rare experience to me it was a closer view of my native town i was fairly inside of it i never had seen its institutions before this is one of its peculiar institutions for it is a shire town i began to comprehend what its inhabitants were about in the morning our breakfasts were put through the hole in the door in small oblongsquare tin pans made to fit and holding a pint of chocolate with brown bread and an iron spoon when they called for the vessels again i was green enough to return what bread i had left but my comrade seized it and said that i should lay that up for lunch or dinner soon after he was let out to work at haying in a neighboring field whither he went every day and would not be back till noon so he bade me goodday saying that he doubted if he should see me again when i came out of prisonfor some one interfered and paid that taxi
587,branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i might be graffed in well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not highminded but fear for if spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and severity of on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for is able to graff them in again for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffed into their own olive tree for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of
588,did not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common such as he observed who went in a youth and emerged a tottering and grayheaded man and yet a change had to my eyes come over the scenethe town and state and countrygreater than any that mere time could effect i saw yet more distinctly the state in which i lived i saw to what extent the people among whom i lived could be trusted as good neighbors and friends that their friendship was for summer weather only that they did not greatly propose to do right that they were a distinct race from me by their prejudices and superstitions as the chinamen and malays are that in their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risks not even to their property that after all they were not so noble but they treated the thief as he had treated them and hoped by a certain outward observance and a few prayers and by walking in a particular straight though useless path from time to time to save their souls this may be to judge my neighbors harshly for i believe that many of them are not aware that they

590,have such an institution as the jail in their village it was formerly the custom in our village when a poor debtor came out of jail for his acquaintances to salute him looking through their fingers which were crossed to represent the grating of a jail window how do ye do my neighbors did not thus salute me but first looked at me and then at one another as if i had returned from a long journey i was put into jail as i was going to the shoemaker's to get a shoe which was mended when i was let out the next morning i proceeded to finish my errand and having put on my mended shoe joined a huckleberry party who were impatient to put themselves under my conduct and in half an hourfor the horse was soon tackledwas in the midst of a huckleberry field on one of our highest hills two miles off and then the state was nowhere to be seen this is the whole history of my prisons i have never declined paying the highway tax because i am as desirous of being a good neighbor as i am of being a bad subject and

592,as for supporting schools i am doing my part to educate my fellowcountrymen now it is for no particular item in the taxbill that i refuse to pay it i simply wish to refuse allegiance to the state to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually i do not care to trace the course of my dollar if i could till it buys a man or a musket to shoot one withthe dollar is innocentbut i am concerned to trace the effects of my allegiance in fact i quietly declare war with the state after my fashion though i will still make what use and get what advantage of her i can as is usual in such cases if others pay the tax which is demanded of me from a sympathy with the state they do but what they have already done in their own case or rather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the state requires if they pay the tax from a mistaken interest in the individual taxed to save his property or prevent his going to jail it is because they have not considered wisely how far they let their private feelings interfere with the

594,public good this then is my position at present but one cannot be too much on his guard in such a case lest his action be biased by obstinacy or an undue regard for the opinions of men let him see that he does only what belongs to himself and to the hour i think sometimes why this people mean well they are only ignorant they would do better if they knew how why give your neighbors this pain to treat you as they are not inclined to but i think again this is no reason why i should do as they do or permit others to suffer much greater pain of a different kind again i sometimes say to myself when many millions of men without heat without illwill without personal feeling of any kind demand of you a few shillings only without the possibility such is their constitution of retracting or altering their present demand and without the possibility on your side of appeal to any other millions why expose yourself to this overwhelming brute force you do not resist cold and hunger the winds and the waves thus obstinately you quietly submit to a thousand similar necessities
595,his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good 1let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of the powers that be are ordained of 1whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation 1for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same 1for he is the minister of to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil 1wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake 1for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are s ministers attending continually upon this very thing 1render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour 1owe no man any thing but to love one another
596,you do not put your head into the fire but just in proportion as i regard this as not wholly a brute force but partly a human force and consider that i have relations to those millions as to so many millions of men and not of mere brute or inanimate things i see that appeal is possible first and instantaneously from them to the maker of them and secondly from them to themselves but if i put my head deliberately into the fire there is no appeal to fire or to the maker of fire and i have only myself to blame if i could convince myself that i have any right to be satisfied with men as they are and to treat them accordingly and not according in some respects to my requisitions and expectations of what they and i ought to be then like a good mussulman and fatalist i should endeavor to be satisfied with things as they are and say it is the will of god and above all there is this difference between resisting this and a purely brute or natural force that i can resist this with some effect but i cannot expect
597,for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law 1for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the law and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying but put ye on the lord and make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof 1him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations 1for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs 1let not him that eateth
598,like orpheus to change the nature of the rocks and trees and beasts i do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation i do not wish to split hairs to make fine distinctions or set myself up as better than my neighbors i seek rather i may say even an excuse for conforming to the laws of the land i am but too ready to conform to them indeed i have reason to suspect myself on this head and each year as the taxgatherer comes round i find myself disposed to review the acts and position of the general and state governments and the spirit of the people to discover a pretext for conformity we must affect our country as our parents and if at any time we alienate our love or industry from doing it honor we must respect effects and teach the soul matter of conscience and religion and not desire of rule or benefit i believe that the state will soon be able to take all my work of this sort out of my hands and then i shall be no better a patriot than my fellowcountrymen seen from a lower point of view the

600,constitution with all its faults is very good the law and the courts are very respectable even this state and this american government are in many respects very admirable and rare things to be thankful for such as a great many have described them but seen from a point of view a little higher they are what i have described them seen from a higher still and the highest who shall say what they are or that they are worth looking at or thinking of at all however the government does not concern me much and i shall bestow the fewest possible thoughts on it it is not many moments that i live under a government even in this world if a man is thoughtfree fancyfree imaginationfree that which is not never for a long time appearing to be to him unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally interrupt him i know that most men think differently from myself but those whose lives are by profession devoted to the study of these or kindred subjects content me as little as any statesmen and legislators standing so completely within the institution never distinctly and nakedly behold it they speak of moving society
601,we shall all stand before the judgment seat of for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to so then every one of us shall give account of himself to let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way i know and am persuaded by the lord that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom died let not then your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost for he that in these things serveth is acceptable to and approved of men let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another for meat destroy not the work of all things indeed are pure but it is evil
602,but have no restingplace without it they may be men of a certain experience and discrimination and have no doubt invented ingenious and even useful systems for which we sincerely thank them but all their wit and usefulness lie within certain not very wide limits they are wont to forget that the world is not governed by policy and expediency webster never goes behind government and so cannot speak with authority about it his words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate no essential reform in the existing government but for thinkers and those who legislate for all time he never once glances at the subject i know of those whose serene and wise speculations on this theme would soon reveal the limits of his mind's range and hospitality yet compared with the cheap professions of most reformers and the still cheaper wisdom and eloquence of politicians in general his are almost the only sensible and valuable words and we thank heaven for him comparatively he is always strong original and above all practical still his quality is not wisdom but prudence the lawyer's truth is not truth but consistency or a consistent expediency truth is always in harmony with
603,for that man who eateth with offence it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak hast thou faith have it to thyself before happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth and he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin 1we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves 1let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification 1for even pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me 1for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope 1now the of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to 1that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify even the father of our lord 1wherefore receive ye one another as also received us to the glory of 1now i say that was
604,herself and is not concerned chiefly to reveal the justice that may consist with wrongdoing he well deserves to be called as he has been called the defender of the constitution there are really no blows to be given by him but defensive ones he is not a leader but a follower his leaders are the men of i have never made an effort he says and never propose to make an effort i have never countenanced an effort and never mean to countenance an effort to disturb the arrangement as originally made by which the various states came into the union still thinking of the sanction which the constitution gives to slavery he says because it was a part of the original compactlet it stand notwithstanding his special acuteness and ability he is unable to take a fact out of its merely political relations and behold it as it lies absolutely to be disposed of by the intellectwhat for instance it behooves a man to do here in america today with regard to slavery but ventures or is driven to make some such desperate answer as the following while professing to speak absolutely and as a private manfrom which
605,a minister of the circumcision for the truth of to confirm the promises made unto the fathers 1and that the gentiles might glorify for his mercy as it is written for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles and sing unto thy name and again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people and again praise the lord all ye gentiles and laud him all ye people and again esaias saith there shall be a root of jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles in him shall the gentiles trust now the of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of that i should be the minister of to the gentiles ministering the gospel of that the offering up of the gentiles might
606,what new and singular code of social duties might be inferred the manner says he in which the governments of those states where slavery exists are to regulate it is for their own consideration under their responsibility to their constituents to the general laws of propriety humanity and justice and to god associations formed elsewhere springing from a feeling of humanity or any other cause have nothing whatever to do with it they have never received any encouragement from me and they never will they who know of no purer sources of truth who have traced up its stream no higher stand and wisely stand by the bible and the constitution and drink at it there with reverence and humility but they who behold where it comes trickling into this lake or that pool gird up their loins once more and continue their pilgrimage toward its fountainhead no man with a genius for legislation has appeared in america they are rare in the history of the world there are orators politicians and eloquent men by the thousand but the speaker has not yet opened his mouth to speak who is capable of settling the muchvexed questions of the day we
607,be acceptable being sanctified by the holy ghost i have therefore whereof i may glory through in those things which pertain to for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which hath not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word and deed through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of yea so have i strived to preach the gospel not where was named lest i should build upon another man's foundation but as it is written to whom he was not spoken of they shall see and they that have not heard shall understand for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming to you but now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you whensoever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be somewhat filled with your company but now i go unto
608,love eloquence for its own sake and not for any truth which it may utter or any heroism it may inspire our legislators have not yet learned the comparative value of freetrade and of freedom of union and of rectitude to a nation they have no genius or talent for comparatively humble questions of taxation and finance commerce and manufacturers and agriculture if we were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in congress for our guidance uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people america would not long retain her rank among the nations for eighteen hundred years though perchance i have no right to say it the new testament has been written yet where is the legislator who has wisdom and practical talent enough to avail himself of the light which it sheds on the science of legislation the authority of government even such as i am willing to submit tofor i will cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than i and in many things even those who neither know nor can do so wellis still an impure one to be strictly just it must have the sanction and consent
609,jerusalem to minister unto the saints for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem it hath pleased them verily and their debtors they are for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain and i am sure that when i come unto you i shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of now i beseech you brethren for the lord s sake and for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in your prayers to for me that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea and that my service which i have for jerusalem may be accepted of the saints that i may come unto you with joy by the will of and may with you be refreshed now the of peace be with you all amen 1i commend unto you phebe our sister which is a servant of
610,of the governed it can have no pure right over my person and property but what i concede to it the progress from an absolute to a limited monarchy from a limited monarchy to a democracy is a progress toward a true respect for the individual even the chinese philosopher was wise enough to regard the individual as the basis of the empire is a democracy such as we know it the last improvement possible in government is it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man there will never be a really free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power from which all its own power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly i please myself with imagining a state at least which can afford to be just to all men and to treat the individual with respect as a neighbor which even would not think it inconsistent with its own repose if a few were to live aloof from it not meddling with it nor embraced by it who fulfilled all the duties of neighbors and fellowmen a state which

614,blameless in the day of our lord is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son our lord now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of is divided was paul crucified for you or were ye baptized in the name of paul i thank that i baptized none of you but crispus and gaius lest any should say that i had baptized in mine own name and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other for sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of should be made of none effect for the
615,preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of the world by wisdom knew not it pleased by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both jews and greeks the power of and the wisdom of because the foolishness of is wiser than men and the weakness of is stronger than men for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things
616,which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are ye in who of is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of for i determined not to know any thing among you save and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought but we speak the wisdom of in a mystery even the hidden
617,wisdom which ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which hath prepared for them that love him but hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of knoweth no man but the spirit of now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of that we might know the things that are freely given to us of which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all
618,things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men for while one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye not carnal who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man i have planted apollos watered but gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour for we are labourers together with ye are s husbandry ye are
619,s building according to the grace of which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire know ye not that ye are the temple of and that the spirit of dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of him shall destroy for the temple of is holy which temple ye are let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise for the wisdom
620,of this world is foolishness with for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain therefore let no man glory in men for all things are your's whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are your's and ye are s and is s let a man so account of us as of the ministers of and stewards of the mysteries of moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of man's judgment yea i judge not mine own self for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to
621,myself and to apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another for who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou that thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it now ye are full now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would to ye did reign that we also might reign with you for i think that hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men we are fools for s sake but ye are wise in we are weak but ye are strong ye are honourable but we are despised even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace and labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we intreat we are made as
622,the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto this day i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you for though ye have ten thousand instructers in yet have ye not many fathers for in i have begotten you through the gospel wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in as i teach every where in every church now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power for the kingdom of is not in word but in power what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his
623,father's wife and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though i were present concerning him that hath so done this deed in the name of our lord when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord your glorying is not good know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye
624,needs go out of the world but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat for what have i to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within but them that are without judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church i speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between
625,his brethren but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord and by the spirit of our all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any meats for the belly and the belly for meats but shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body and hath both raised up the
626,lord and will also raise up us by his own power know ye not that your bodies are the members of shall i then take the members of and make them the members of an harlot forbid what know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify in your body and in your spirit which are s now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband the wife hath not
627,power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency but i speak this by permission and not of commandment for i would that all men were even as i myself but every man hath his proper gift of one after this manner and another after that i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with
628,him let him not put her away and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but hath called us to peace for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife but as hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called every one so let him walk and so ordain i in all churches is any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised is any called in uncircumcision let him not be circumcised circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it
629,rather for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lord's freeman likewise also he that is called being free is s servant ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed art thou loosed from a wife seek not a wife but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you but this i say brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they
630,possessed not and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away but i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife there is difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband and this i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power over
631,his own will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know but if any man love the same is known of him as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other but one for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords many but to
632,us there is but one the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord by whom are all things and we by him howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled but meat commendeth us not to for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse but take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom died but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend am i not an apostle am
633,i not free have i not seen our lord are not ye my work in the lord if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord mine answer to them that do examine me is this have we not power to eat and to drink have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas or i only and barnabas have not we power to forbear working who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock say i these things as a man or saith not the law the same also for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn doth take care for oxen or saith he it altogether for our sakes for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope
634,and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather nevertheless we have not used this power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel
635,is committed unto me what is my reward then verily that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel of without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law to them that are without law as without law being not without law to but under the law to that i might gain them that are without law to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some and this i do for the gospel's sake that i might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things
636,now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway 1moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea 1and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea 1and did all eat the same spiritual meat 1and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was 1but with many of them was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness 1now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted 1neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play 1neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell
637,in one day three and twenty thousand 1neither let us tempt as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of
638,the sacrifices partakers of the altar what say i then that the idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing but i say that the things which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lord's table and of the table of devils do we provoke the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth whatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no question for conscience sake for the earth is the lord's and the fulness thereof if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for
639,his sake that shewed it and for conscience sake for the earth is the lord's and the fulness thereof conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience for if i by grace be a partaker why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of even as i please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved 1be ye followers of me even as i also am of 1now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you 1but i would have you know that the head of every man is and the head of the woman is the man and the head of is 1every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoureth his head 1but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth
640,her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven 1for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered 1for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of but the woman is the glory of the man 1for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man 1neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto uncovered doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her
641,hair is given her for a covering but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you when ye come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the lord's supper for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken what have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of and shame them that have not what shall i say to you shall i praise you in this i praise you not for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake
642,it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man
643,hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come 1now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant 1ye know that ye were gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols even as ye were led 1wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of calleth accursed and that no man can say that is the lord but by the holy ghost 1now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit 1and there are differences of administrations but the same lord 1and there are diversities of operations but it is the same which worketh all in all 1but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal 1for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit 1to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all
644,these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand
645,i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness for our comely parts have no need but hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it now ye are the body of and members in particular and hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet
646,shew i unto you a more excellent way 1though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal 1and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing 1and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing 1charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up 1doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil 1rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth 1beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things 1charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away 1for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall
647,be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity 1follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy 1for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries 1but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort 1he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church 1i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying 1now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to
648,you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine 1and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped 1for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle 1so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful what is it then i will pray with the spirit and i will
649,pray with the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understanding also else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest for thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edified i thank my i speak with tongues more than ye all yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be men in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the lord wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with
650,tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship and report that is in you of a truth how is it then brethren when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by let the first hold his peace for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be
651,comforted and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets for is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church what came the word of out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues let all things be done decently and in order 1moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand 1by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed
652,in vain 1for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that died for our sins according to the scriptures 1and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures 1and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve 1after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep 1after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles 1and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time 1for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of but by the grace of i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of which was with me therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye believed now if be preached that he rose from the dead how say some
653,among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is not risen and if be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain yea and we are found false witnesses of because we have testified of that he raised up whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not raised and if be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in are perished if in this life only we have hope in we are of all men most miserable but now is risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead for as in adam all die even so in shall all be made alive but every man in his own order the firstfruits afterward they that are s at his coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to even the father when he shall
654,have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that may be all in all else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead and why stand we in jeopardy every hour i protest by your rejoicing which i have in our lord i die daily if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for to morrow we die be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of i speak this
655,to your shame but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it
656,is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall
657,have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to which giveth us the victory through our lord therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord 1now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye 1upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come 1and when i come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem 1and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me 1now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia for i do pass through macedonia
658,1and it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go 1for i will not see you now by the way but i trust to tarry a while with you if the lord permit 1but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost 1for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brethren as touching our brother apollos i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong let all your things be done with charity i beseech you brethren ye know the house of stephanas that it is the firstfruits of achaia and that they
659,have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints that ye submit yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with us and laboureth i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied for they have refreshed my spirit and your's therefore acknowledge ye them that are such the churches of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord with the church that is in their house all the brethren greet you greet ye one another with an holy kiss the salutation of me paul with mine own hand if any man love not the lord let him be anathema maranatha the grace of our lord be with you my love be with you all in amen paul an apostle of by the will of and timothy our brother unto the church of which is at corinth with all the saints which are in all achaia grace be to you and peace from our father and from the lord blessed be even the father of our lord the father of mercies and the of all comfort who comforteth us in all
660,our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of for as the sufferings of abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation and our hope of you is stedfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so shall ye be also of the consolation for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength insomuch that we despaired even of life but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in which raiseth the dead who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us ye also helping together by prayer for us that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be
661,given by many on our behalf for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to youward for we write none other things unto you than what ye read or acknowledge and i trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end as also ye have acknowledged us in part that we are your rejoicing even as ye also are our's in the day of the lord and in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before that ye might have a second benefit and to pass by you into macedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you to be brought on my way toward judaea when i therefore was thus minded did i use lightness or the things that i purpose do i purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be yea yea and nay nay but as is true our word toward you was not yea and nay for the son of who was preached among you by us even by me
662,and silvanus and timotheus was not yea and nay but in him was yea for all the promises of in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of by us now he which stablisheth us with you in and hath anointed us is who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts moreover i call for a record upon my soul that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth not for that we have dominion over your faith but are helpers of your joy for by faith ye stand but i determined this with myself that i would not come again to you in heaviness for if i make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by me and i wrote this same unto you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be grieved but
663,that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you but if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part that i may not overcharge you all sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether ye be obedient in all things to whom ye forgive any thing i forgive also for if i forgave any thing to whom i forgave it for your sakes forgave i it in the person of lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices furthermore when i came to troas to preach s gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord i had no rest in my spirit because i found not my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia now thanks be
664,unto which always causeth us to triumph in and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place for we are unto a sweet savour of in them that are saved and in them that perish to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life and who is sufficient for these things for we are not as many which corrupt the word of but as of sincerity but as of in the sight of speak we in do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart and such trust have we through to ward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of who also hath made us able
665,ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in but even unto this
666,day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of who is the image of should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but the lord and ourselves your servants for sake for who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts
667,to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of in the face of but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord that the life also of might be made manifest in our body for we which live are alway delivered unto death for sake that the life also of might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord shall raise up us also by and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward
668,man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by
669,sight we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for we must all appear before the judgment seat of that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart for whether we be beside ourselves it is to or whether we be sober it is for your cause for the love of constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we no man after
670,the flesh yea though we have known after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore if any man be in he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of who hath reconciled us to himself by and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that was in reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for as though did beseech you by us we pray you in s stead be ye reconciled to for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of in him we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of in vain for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation giving no offence in any thing that the ministry be not blamed but in
671,all things approving ourselves as the ministers of in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned by the word of truth by the power of by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet alway rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own bowels now for a recompence in the same i speak as unto my children be ye also enlarged be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what concord hath with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and
672,what agreement hath the temple of with idols for ye are the temple of the living as hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no man i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears nevertheless
673,that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoiced the more for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter wherefore though i wrote unto you i did it not for
674,his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of might appear unto you therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of because his spirit was refreshed by you all for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which i made before is found a truth and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all things moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of bestowed on the churches of macedonia how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon
675,us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of insomuch that we desired that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love for ye know the grace of our lord that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich and herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago now therefore perform the doing of it that as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted
676,according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not for i mean not that other men be eased and ye burdened but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want that there may be equality as it is written he that had gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had no lack but thanks be to which put the same earnest care into the heart of for you for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward of his own accord he went unto you and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches and not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and declaration of your ready mind avoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us providing for honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also
677,in the sight of men and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which i have in you whether any do enquire of he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be enquired of they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf for as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you for i know the forwardness of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago and your zeal hath provoked very many yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as i said ye may be ready lest haply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boasting therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they
678,would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for loveth a cheerful giver and is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify for your professed subjection unto the gospel of and
679,for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of in you thanks be unto for his unspeakable gift 1now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward you 1but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh 1for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh 1for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through to the pulling down of strong holds 1casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of 1and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled 1do ye look on things after the outward appearance if any man trust to himself that he is s let him of himself think this again that as he is s even
680,so are we s 1for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord hath given us for edification and not for your destruction i should not be ashamed 1that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by letters for his letters say they are weighty and powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible let such an one think this that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we are present for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise but we will not boast of things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which hath distributed to us a measure to reach even unto you for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of not boasting of things without our measure that is of other men's labours but having
681,hope when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth 1would to ye could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me 1for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to 1but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in 1for if he that cometh preacheth another whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him 1for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles 1but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have
682,been throughly made manifest among you in all things 1have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted because i have preached to you the gospel of freely 1i robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service 1and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied and in all things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you and so will i keep myself as the truth of is in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of achaia wherefore because i love you not knoweth but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even as we for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
683,i say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that i may boast myself a little that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak howbeit whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly i am bold also are they so am i are they israelites so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i are they ministers of i speak as a fool i am more in labours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths oft of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a
684,day i have been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak and i am not weak who is offended and i burn not if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities the and father of our lord which is blessed for evermore knoweth that i lie not in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands 1it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord 1i knew a man in above fourteen years ago whether in
685,the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven 1and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell knoweth 1how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter 1of such an one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine infirmities 1for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me 1and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure 1for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me 1and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly
686,therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for s sake for when i am weak then am i strong i am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for i ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles though i be nothing truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you forgive me this wrong behold the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be burdensome to you for i seek not your's but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless being crafty
687,i caught you with guile did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you i desired and with him i sent a brother did make a gain of you walked we not in the same spirit walked we not in the same steps again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you we speak before in but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest there be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumults and lest when i come again my will humble me among you and that i shall bewail many which have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed 1this is the third time i am coming to you in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established 1i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned
688,and to all other that if i come again i will not spare 1since ye seek a proof of speaking in me which to youward is not weak but is mighty in you 1for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of toward you 1examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your own selves how that is in you except ye be reprobates 1but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates 1now i pray to that ye do no evil not that we should appear approved but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as reprobates 1for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth 1for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfection therefore i write these things being absent lest being present i should use sharpness according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction finally brethren farewell be
689,perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the of love and peace shall be with you greet one another with an holy kiss all the saints salute you the grace of the lord and the love of and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all amen paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by and the father who raised him from the dead and all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia grace be to you and peace from the father and from our lord who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of and our father to whom be glory for ever and ever amen i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said
690,before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed for do i now persuade men or or do i seek to please men for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of and wasted it and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus then after three
691,years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days but other of the apostles saw i none save the lord's brother now the things which i write unto you behold before i lie not afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed and they glorified in me then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and took with me also and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain but neither who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that
692,the truth of the gospel might continue with you but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me accepteth no man's person for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles and when james cephas and who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision only they would that we should remember the poor the same which i also was forward to do but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision and the other
693,jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews we who are jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of even we have believed in that we might be justified by the faith of and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified but if while we seek to be justified by we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore the minister of sin forbid for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto i am crucified with neverthless i live yet not i but liveth in me and the life which
694,i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of who loved me and gave himself for me i do not frustrate the grace of for if righteousness come by the law then is dead in vain o foolish who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh have ye suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith even as abraham believed and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham and the scripture foreseeing that would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be
695,blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of it is evident for the just shall live by faith and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is and
696,this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of in the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but gave it to abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator now a mediator is not a mediator of one but is one is the law then against the promises of forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of might be given to them that believe but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto that we might be justified by faith but after that faith is come we are no longer under a
697,schoolmaster for ye are all the children of by faith in for as many of you as have been baptized into have put on there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in and if ye be s then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fulness of the time was come sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of through howbeit then when ye knew not ye did
698,service unto them which by nature are no gods but now after that ye have known or rather are known of how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage ye observe days and months and times and years i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain brethren i beseech you be as i am for i am as ye are ye have not injured me at all ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of even as where is then the blessedness ye spake of for i bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth they zealously affect you but not well yea they would exclude you that ye might affect them but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing and not only
699,when i am present with you my little children of whom i travail in birth again until be formed in you i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for i stand in doubt of you tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was by promise which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is agar for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise but as
700,then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised shall profit you nothing for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump i have
701,confidence in you through the lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be and i brethren if i yet preach circumcision why do i yet suffer persecution then is the offence of the cross ceased i would they were even cut off which trouble you for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred
702,variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him
703,that teacheth in all good things be not deceived is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh but forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world for in neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but a new creature and as many as
704,walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord brethren the grace of our lord be with your spirit amen paul an apostle of by the will of to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in grace be to you and peace from our father and from the lord blessed be the and father of our lord who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his
705,will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the of our lord the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being
706,enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh
707,and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others but who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in unto good works which hath before ordained that we should walk in them wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without in the world but now in ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the
708,blood of for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets himself being the chief corner stone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of through the spirit for this cause i paul the prisoner of for you gentiles if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of which is given me to youward how that by revelation he made known
709,unto me the mystery as i wrote afore in few words whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in by the gospel whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in who created all things by to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him wherefore i
710,desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fulness of now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him be glory in the church by throughout all ages world without end amen i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
711,there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of
712,doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but ye have not so learned if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which
713,after is created in righteousness and true holiness wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbour for we are members one of another be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as for s sake hath forgiven you be ye therefore followers of as dear children and walk in love as also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to for a sweetsmelling savour but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness
714,let it not be once named among you as becometh saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of and of let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of upon the children of disobedience be not ye therefore partakers with them for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as
715,wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord giving thanks always for all things unto and the father in the name of our lord submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the body therefore as the church is subject unto so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing husbands love your wives even as also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to
716,love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honour thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the
717,servants of doing the will of from the heart with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free and ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench
718,all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak but that ye also may know my affairs and how i do tychicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known to you all things whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts peace be to the brethren and love with faith from the father and the lord grace be with all them that love our lord in sincerity amen paul and timotheus the servants of to all the saints in which are at philippi with the bishops and deacons grace be unto you and peace from our father and from the
719,lord i thank my upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of even as it is meet for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all are partakers of my grace for is my record how greatly i long after you all in the bowels of and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that ye may approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by unto the glory and praise of but i would ye should understand brethren that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in are manifest
720,in all the palace and in all other places and many of the brethren in the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear some indeed preach even of envy and strife and some also of good will the one preach of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth is preached and i therein do rejoice yea and will rejoice for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me to live is and to die is gain but if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labour yet what i shall choose i wot not for i am in a strait betwixt two having a
721,desire to depart and to be with which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you and having this confidence i know that i shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith that your rejoicing may be more abundant in for me by my coming to you again only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of that whether i come and see you or else be absent i may hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel and in nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of for unto you it is given in the behalf of not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me if there be therefore any consolation in if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded
722,having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in who being in the form of thought it not robbery to be equal with but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that is lord to the glory of the father wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling
723,for it is which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputings that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of that i have not run in vain neither laboured in vain yea and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me but i trust in the lord to send timotheus shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state for i have no man likeminded who will naturally care for your state for all seek their own not the things which are s but ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father he hath served with me in the gospel him therefore i hope to send presently so soon as i shall see how it will go
724,with me but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but your messenger and he that ministered to my wants for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that ye had heard that he had been sick for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also lest i should have sorrow upon sorrow i sent him therefore the more carefully that when ye see him again ye may rejoice and that i may be the less sorrowful receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness and hold such in reputation because for the work of he was nigh unto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward me finally my brethren rejoice in the lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision for we are the circumcision which worship in the spirit
725,and rejoice in and have no confidence in the flesh though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin an hebrew of the as touching the law a pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gain to me those i counted loss for yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of the righteousness which is of by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either were already
726,perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of in let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded shall reveal even this unto you nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of whose end is destruction whose is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour the lord who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious
727,body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and crown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved i beseech euodias and beseech syntyche that they be of the same mind in the lord and i intreat thee also true yokefellow help those women which laboured with me in the gospel with clement also and with other my fellowlabourers whose names are in the book of life rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto and the peace of which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and
728,seen in me do and the of peace shall be with you but i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again wherein ye were also careful but ye lacked opportunity not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content i know both how to be abased and i know how to abound every where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need i can do all things through which strengtheneth me notwithstanding ye have well done that ye did communicate with my affliction now ye know also that in the beginning of the gospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye only for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity not because i desire a gift but i desire fruit that may abound to your account but i have all and abound i am full having received of epaphroditus the things which were sent from you an odour of a
729,sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable wellpleasing to but my shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by now unto and our father be glory for ever and ever amen salute every saint in the brethren which are with me greet you all the saints salute you chiefly they that are of caesar's household the grace of our lord be with you all amen paul an apostle of by the will of and timotheus our brother to the saints and faithful brethren in which are at colosse grace be unto you and peace from our father and the lord we give thanks to and the father of our lord praying always for you since we heard of your faith in and of the love which ye have to all the saints for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel which is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew the grace of in truth as ye also learned of epaphras

740,serve the living and true and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even which delivered us from the wrath to come for yourselves brethren know our entrance in unto you that it was not in vain but even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as ye know at philippi we were bold in our to speak unto you the gospel of with much contention for our exhortation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor in guile but as we were allowed of to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but which trieth our hearts for neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know nor a cloke of covetousness is witness nor of men sought we glory neither of you nor yet of others when we might have been burdensome as the apostles of but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherisheth her children so being affectionately desirous of you we were willing to have imparted unto you not the gospel of only but also our own souls because ye were dear unto us
741,for ye remember brethren our labour and travail for labouring night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of ye are witnesses and also how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his children that ye would walk worthy of who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory for this cause also thank we without ceasing because when ye received the word of which ye heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of which effectually worketh also in you that believe for ye brethren became followers of the churches of which in judaea are in for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen even as they have of the jews who both killed the lord and their own prophets and have persecuted us and they please not and are contrary to all men forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved to fill up their
742,sins alway for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost but we brethren being taken from you for a short time in presence not in heart endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire wherefore we would have come unto you even i paul once and again but satan hindered us for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our lord at his coming for ye are our glory and joy wherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to be left at athens alone and sent timotheus our brother and minister of and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith that no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto for verily when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass and ye know for this cause when i could no longer forbear i sent to know your faith lest by some means the tempter have tempted you and our labour be in
743,vain but now when timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance of us always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you therefore brethren we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith for now we live if ye stand fast in the lord for what thanks can we render to again for you for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith now himself and our father and our lord direct our way unto you and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before even our father at the coming of our lord with all his saints furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the lord that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please so
744,ye would abound more and more for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord for this is the will of even your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour not in the lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which know not that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because that the lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified for hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but who hath also given unto us his holy spirit but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of to love one another and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more and more and that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commanded you that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without
745,and that ye may have lack of nothing but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that died and rose again even so them also which sleep in will bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of and the dead in shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words but of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden
746,destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation for hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do and we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake and be at peace among yourselves now we exhort you
747,brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing in every thing give thanks for this is the will of in concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesyings prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the very of peace sanctify you wholly and i pray your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it brethren pray for us greet all the brethren with an holy kiss i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren the grace of our lord be with you amen paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians in our father and the lord grace unto you and peace from our father and the lord we are bound to thank always for you brethren as it is meet because that
748,your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of for which ye also suffer seeing it is a righteous thing with to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you and to you who are troubled rest with us when the lord shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not and that obey not the gospel of our lord who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day wherefore also we pray always for you that our would count you worthy of this calling and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of
749,faith with power that the name of our lord may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our and the lord now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called or that is worshipped so that he as sitteth in the temple of shewing himself that he is remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume
750,with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness but we are bound to give thanks alway to for you brethren beloved of the lord because hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or our epistle now our lord himself and even our father which hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and work finally brethren pray for us that the
751,word of the lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not faith but the lord is faithful who shall stablish you and keep you from evil and we have confidence in the lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which we command you and the lord direct your hearts into the love of and into the patient waiting for now we command you brethren in the name of our lord that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you neither did we eat any man's bread for nought but wrought with labour and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat
752,for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busybodies now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord that with quietness they work and eat their own bread but ye brethren be not weary in well doing and if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed yet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means the lord be with you all the salutation of paul with mine own hand which is the token in every epistle so i write the grace of our lord be with you all amen paul an apostle of by the commandment of our saviour and lord which is our hope unto timothy my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from our father and our lord as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine neither give heed to fables and
753,endless genealogies which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith so do now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm but we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but for the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners for unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers for manslayers for whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine according to the glorious gospel of the blessed which was committed to my trust and i thank our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but i obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief
754,and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise be honour and glory for ever and ever amen this charge i commit unto thee son timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest war a good warfare holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck of whom is hymenaeus and alexander whom i have delivered unto satan that they may learn not to blaspheme i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight
755,of our saviour who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth for there is one and one mediator between and men the man who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time whereunto i am ordained a preacher and an apostle i speak the truth in and lie not a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity i will therefore that men pray every where lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works let the woman learn in silence with all subjection but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety this is a true saying if a man desire the
756,office of a bishop he desireth a good work a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife vigilant sober of good behaviour given to hospitality apt to teach not given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucre but patient not a brawler not covetous one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil moreover he must have a good report of them which are without lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil likewise must the deacons be grave not doubletongued not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucre holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience and let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their
757,own houses well for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of which is the church of the living the pillar and ground of the truth and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth for every creature of is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving for it is sanctified by the word of and prayer if thou put
758,the brethren in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attained but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living who is the saviour of all men specially of those that believe these things command and teach let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery meditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them that thy profiting may appear to all take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in
759,doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee rebuke not an elder but intreat him as a father and the younger men as brethren the elder women as mothers the younger as sisters with all purity honour widows that are widows indeed but if any widow have children or nephews let them learn first to shew piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before now she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth and these things give in charge that they may be blameless but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old having been the wife of one man well reported of for good works if she have brought up children if she have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet if she have relieved the afflicted if she have diligently followed every
760,good work but the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to wax wanton against they will marry having damnation because they have cast off their first faith and withal they learn to be idle wandering about from house to house and not only idle but tattlers also and busybodies speaking things which they ought not i will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully for some are already turned aside after satan if any man or woman that believeth have widows let them relieve them and let not the church be charged that it may relieve them that are widows indeed let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour especially they who labour in the word and doctrine for the scripture saith thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn and the labourer is worthy of his reward against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear i charge thee before and the lord and the elect angels that thou observe these things
761,without preferring one before another doing nothing by partiality lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other men's sins keep thyself pure drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities some men's sins are open beforehand going before to judgment and some men they follow after likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand and they that are otherwise cannot be hid let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour that the name of and his doctrine be not blasphemed and they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit these things teach and exhort if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord and to the doctrine which is according to godliness he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is
762,godliness from such withdraw thyself but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be therewith content but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but thou o man of flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses i give thee charge in the sight of who quickeneth all things and before who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebukable until the appearing of our lord which in his times he shall shew who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in the
763,light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honour and power everlasting amen charge them that are rich in this world that they be not highminded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the living who giveth us richly all things to enjoy that they do good that they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicate laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life o timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called which some professing have erred concerning the faith grace be with thee amen paul an apostle of by the will of according to the promise of life which is in to timothy my dearly beloved son grace mercy and peace from the father and our lord i thank whom i serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that i may be filled
764,with joy when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded that in thee also wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel whereunto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom
765,i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us this thou knowest that all they which are in asia be turned away from me of whom are phygellus and hermogenes the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus for he oft refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain but when he was in rome he sought me out very diligently and found me the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in that day and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus thou knowest very well thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of no man that warreth entangleth
766,himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier and if a man also strive for masteries yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully the husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits consider what i say and the lord give thee understanding in all things remember that of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel wherein i suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds but the word of is not bound therefore i endure all things for the elect's sakes that they may also obtain the salvation which is in with eternal glory it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers study to shew thyself approved unto a
767,workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some nevertheless the foundation of standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let every one that nameth the name of depart from iniquity but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honour and some to dishonour if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honour sanctified and meet for the master's use and prepared unto every good work flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in
768,meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as jannes and jambres withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as their's also was but thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience
769,persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me yea and all that will live godly in shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in all scripture is given by inspiration of and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works i charge thee therefore before and the lord who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn
770,away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing do thy diligence to come shortly unto me for demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed unto thessalonica crescens to galatia unto dalmatia only is with me take and bring him with thee for he is profitable to me for the ministry and tychicus have i sent to ephesus the cloke that i left at troas with carpus when thou comest bring with thee and the books but especially the parchments alexander the coppersmith did me much evil the lord reward him according to his works of whom be thou ware also for
771,he hath greatly withstood our words at my first answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me i pray that it may not be laid to their charge notwithstanding the lord stood with me and strengthened me that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the gentiles might hear and i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen salute prisca and aquila and the household of onesiphorus erastus abode at corinth but trophimus have i left at miletum sick do thy diligence to come before winter eubulus greeteth thee and pudens and linus and claudia and all the brethren the lord be with thy spirit grace be with you amen paul a servant of and an apostle of according to the faith of s elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness in hope of eternal life which that cannot lie promised before the world began but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me
772,according to the commandment of our saviour to mine own son after the common faith grace mercy and peace from the father and the lord our saviour for this cause left i thee in crete that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as i had appointed thee if any be blameless the husband of one wife having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly for a bishop must be blameless as the steward of not selfwilled not soon angry not given to wine no striker not given to filthy lucre but a lover of hospitality a lover of good men sober just holy temperate holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers specially they of the circumcision whose mouths must be stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucre's sake one of themselves even a prophet of their own said the cretians are alway liars evil beasts slow bellies this witness is true wherefore rebuke
773,them sharply that they may be sound in the faith not giving heed to jewish fables and commandments of men that turn from the truth unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled they profess that they know but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine that the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patience the aged women likewise that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of be not blasphemed young men likewise exhort to be sober minded in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine shewing uncorruptness gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having
774,no evil thing to say of you exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again not purloining but shewing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of our saviour in all things for the grace of that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great and our saviour who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work to speak evil of no man to be no brawlers but gentle shewing all meekness unto all men for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another but after that the kindness and
775,love of our saviour toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost which he shed on us abundantly through our saviour that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life this is a faithful saying and these things i will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in might be careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable unto men but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth being condemned of himself when i shall send artemas unto thee or tychicus be diligent to come unto me to nicopolis for i have determined there to winter bring zenas the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently that nothing be wanting unto them and let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses that they be not unfruitful
776,all that are with me salute thee greet them that love us in the faith grace be with you all amen paul a prisoner of and timothy our brother unto our dearly beloved and fellowlabourer and to our beloved apphia and archippus our fellowsoldier and to the church in thy house grace to you and peace from our father and the lord i thank my making mention of thee always in my prayers hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the lord and toward all saints that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother wherefore though i might be much bold in to enjoin thee that which is convenient yet for love's sake i rather beseech thee being such an one as paul the aged and now also a prisoner of i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my bonds which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me whom i
777,have sent again thou therefore receive him that is mine own bowels whom i would have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel but without thy mind would i do nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou shouldest receive him for ever not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the lord if thou count me therefore a partner receive him as myself if he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine account i paul have written it with mine own hand i will repay it albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides yea brother let me have joy of thee in the lord refresh my bowels in the lord having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee knowing that thou wilt also do more than i say but withal prepare me also a lodging for i
778,trust that through your prayers i shall be given unto you there salute thee epaphras my fellowprisoner in marcus aristarchus demas lucas my fellowlabourers the grace of our lord be with your spirit amen who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of worship him
779,and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire but unto the son he saith thy throne o is for ever and ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore even thy hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows and thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was
780,stedfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he
781,by the grace of should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which hath given me forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and
782,faithful high priest in things pertaining to to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is and moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end wherefore as the holy ghost saith to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my
783,works forty years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do alway err in their heart and they have not known my ways so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living but exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end while it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us
784,of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief again he limiteth a certain day saying in david to day after so long a time as it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts for if had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of for he
785,that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as did from his let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens the son of let us hold fast our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in
786,things pertaining to that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity and by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins and no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called of as was aaron so also glorified not himself to be made an high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son to day have i begotten thee as he saith also in another place thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him called of an high priest after the order of melchisedec of whom we
787,have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this will we do if permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of and the powers of the world to come if
788,they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak for is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he sware by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained
789,the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife wherein willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil whither the forerunner is for us entered even made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of abideth a priest continually now consider how great
790,this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth and as i may so say levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithes in abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedec met him if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be called after the order of aaron for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law for he of whom these
791,things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest for those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec by so much was made a surety of a better testament and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of
792,death but this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the people's for this he did once when he offered up himself for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated for evermore now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer for if he were on earth
793,he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith
794,the lord i will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuary and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had manna and aaron's rod that budded and the tables of the covenant and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the
795,mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularly now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation but being come an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and
796,the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all
797,things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment so was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation 1for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered
798,year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect 1for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins 1but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year 1for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins 1wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me 1in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure 1then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o 1above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein which are offered by the law 1then said he lo i come to do thy will o he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of once for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
799,never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without
800,wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense saith the lord and again the lord shall judge his people it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight
801,of afflictions partly whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of ye might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul 1now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen 1for by it the elders obtained a good report 1through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear 1by faith
802,abel offered unto a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh 1by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased 1but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him 1by faith noah being warned of of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith 1by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went 1by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath
803,foundations whose builder and maker is through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is an heavenly wherefore is not ashamed to be called their for he hath prepared for them a city by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed
804,be called accounting that was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come by faith jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of joseph and worshipped leaning upon the top of his staff by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood
805,lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land which the egyptians assaying to do were drowned by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being
806,destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect 1wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us 1looking unto the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of 1for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds 1ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin 1and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him 1for whom the lord loveth he
807,chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth 1if ye endure chastening dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not 1but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons 1furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and
808,thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but ye are come unto mount sion and unto the city of the living the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made
809,perfect and to the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things that that of abel see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our is a consuming fire 1let brotherly love continue 1be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares 1remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body 1marriage is honourable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers will judge 1let your conversation be
810,without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee 1so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me 1remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation 1 the same yesterday and to day and for ever 1be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come by him therefore let

813,sooner risen with a burning heat but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of for cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death do not err my beloved brethren every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man
814,worketh not the righteousness of wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain pure religion and undefiled before and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world my brethren have not the faith of our lord the lord of glory with respect of persons for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in
815,goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit here under my footstool are ye not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts hearken my beloved brethren hath not chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him but ye have despised the poor do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ye do well but if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill now if thou commit no adultery yet
816,if thou kill thou art become a transgressor of the law so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works thou believest that there is one thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar seest thou how
817,faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body behold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whithersoever the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter
818,a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire of hell for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison therewith bless we even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter can the fig tree my brethren bear olive berries either a vine figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth
819,this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace from whence come wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask not ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to resist
820,the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up speak not evil one of another brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy who art thou that judgest another go to now ye that say to day or to morrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this
821,or that but now ye rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin go to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire ye have heaped treasure together for the last days behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud crieth and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter ye have condemned and killed the just and he doth not resist you be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latter
822,rain be ye also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh grudge not one against another brethren lest ye be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy but above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be yea and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnation is any among you afflicted let him pray is any merry let him sing psalms is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one
823,to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins peter an apostle of to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia elect according to the foreknowledge of the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of grace unto you and peace be multiplied blessed be the and father of our lord which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved
824,in heaven for you who are kept by the power of through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down
825,from heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for i am holy and if ye call on the father who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work pass the time of your sojourning here in fear forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in seeing ye have purified your souls
826,in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of which liveth and abideth for ever for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the lord endureth for ever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to by wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in sion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be
827,confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify in the day of visitation submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for
828,the praise of them that do well for so is the will of that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness but as the servants of honour all men love the brotherhood fear honour the king servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with for even hereunto were ye called because also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should
829,live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as sara obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of
830,the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile let him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil and who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled but sanctify the lord in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas
831,they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in for it is better if the will of be so that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing for also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometime were disobedient when once the longsuffering of waited in the days of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward by the resurrection of who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him forasmuch then as hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that he no longer
832,should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to in the spirit but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins use hospitality one to another without grudging as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of if any man minister
833,let him do it as of the ability which giveth that in all things may be glorified through to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever amen beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of s sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy if ye be reproached for the name of happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other men's matters yet if any man suffer as a ian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify on this behalf for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the
834,ungodly and the sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind neither as being lords over s heritage but being ensamples to the flock and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist
835,stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect stablish strengthen settle you to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen by silvanus a faithful brother unto you as i suppose i have written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of wherein ye stand the church that is at babylon elected together with you saluteth you and so doth marcus my son greet ye one another with a kiss of charity peace be with you all that are in amen 2 peter simon peter a servant and an apostle of to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of and our saviour 2 peter grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of and of our lord 2 peter according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue 2 peter whereby
836,are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust 2 peter and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge 2 peter and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness 2 peter and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity 2 peter for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord 2 peter but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins 2 peter wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall 2 peter for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour 2 peter wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the
837,present truth 2 peter yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance 2 peter knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord hath shewed me 2 peter moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance 2 peter for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord but were eyewitnesses of his majesty 2 peter for he received from the father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased 2 peter and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount 2 peter we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts 2 peter knowing this first that no prophecy of the
838,scripture is of any private interpretation 2 peter for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of spake as they were moved by the holy ghost 2 peter but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction 2 peter and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of 2 peter and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not 2 peter for if spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment 2 peter and spared not the old world but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly 2 peter and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an
839,ensample unto those that after should live ungodly 2 peter and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked 2 peter for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds 2 peter the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished 2 peter but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities 2 peter whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the lord 2 peter but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption 2 peter and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you 2 peter having eyes full of adultery and
840,that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children 2 peter which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness 2 peter but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet 2 peter these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever 2 peter for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error 2 peter while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage 2 peter for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning 2 peter for it had been better for them not
841,to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them 2 peter but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire 2 peter this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance 2 peter that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour 2 peter knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts 2 peter and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation 2 peter for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water 2 peter whereby the world that then was being overflowed
842,with water perished 2 peter but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men 2 peter but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day 2 peter the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance 2 peter but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up 2 peter seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness 2 peter looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent
843,heat 2 peter nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 2 peter wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless 2 peter and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you 2 peter as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction 2 peter ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness 2 peter but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour to him be glory both now and for ever amen that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of
844,the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of his son cleanseth us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have
845,not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for our's only but also for the sins of the whole world and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of perfected hereby know we that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked brethren i write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning again a new commandment i write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is past and the true light now shineth he that saith he is
846,in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one i write unto you little children because ye have known the father i have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
847,the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of abideth for ever little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us but ye have an unction from the holy one and ye know all things i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but because ye know it and that no lie is of the truth who is a liar but he that denieth that is the he is antichrist that denieth the father and the son whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if
848,that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming if ye know that he is righteous ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be
849,like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of in this the children of are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of neither he that loveth not his brother for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as cain who was of that wicked one
850,and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous marvel not my brethren if the world hate you we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive we the love of because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren but whoso hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of in him my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and
851,do those things that are pleasing in his sight and this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son and love one another as he gave us commandment and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of every spirit that confesseth that is come in the flesh is of and every spirit that confesseth not that is come in the flesh is not of and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world ye are of little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of he that knoweth heareth us he that is not of heareth not us hereby
852,know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error beloved let us love one another for love is of and every one that loveth is born of and knoweth he that loveth not knoweth not for is love in this was manifested the love of toward us because that sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we loved but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if so loved us we ought also to love one another no man hath seen at any time if we love one another dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world whosoever shall confess that is the son of dwelleth in him and he in and we have known and believed the love that hath to us is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in and in
853,him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say i love and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love whom he hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth love his brother also whosoever believeth that is the is born of and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of when we love and keep his commandments for this is the love of that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for whatsoever is born of overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that is
854,the son of this is he that came by water and blood even not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one if we receive the witness of men the witness of is greater for this is the witness of which he hath testified of his son he that believeth on the son of hath the witness in himself he that believeth not hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that gave of his son and this is the record that hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of hath not life these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of that ye may know that ye have eternal life and
855,that ye may believe on the name of the son of and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death there is a sin unto death i do not say that he shall pray for it all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death we know that whosoever is born of sinneth not but he that is begotten of keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not and we know that we are of and the whole world lieth in wickedness and we know that the son of is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son this is the true and eternal life little children keep yourselves from
856,idols amen the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not i only but also all they that have known the truth for the truth's sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever grace be with you mercy and peace from the father and from the lord the son of the father in truth and love i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truth as we have received a commandment from the father and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another and this is love that we walk after his commandments this is the commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of hath not
857,he that abideth in the doctrine of he hath both the father and the son if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him speed for he that biddeth him speed is partaker of his evil deeds having many things to write unto you i would not write with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full the children of thy elect sister greet thee amen the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius whom i love in the truth beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth for i rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers which have borne witness of thy charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort thou shalt do well because that
858,for his name's sake they went forth taking nothing of the gentiles we therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth i wrote unto the church but diotrephes who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us not wherefore if i come i will remember his deeds which he doeth prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith neither doth he himself receive the brethren and forbiddeth them that would and casteth them out of the church beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good he that doeth good is of but he that doeth evil hath not seen demetrius hath good report of all men and of the truth itself yea and we also bear record and ye know that our record is true i had many things to write but i will not with ink and pen write unto thee but i trust i shall shortly see thee and we shall speak face to face peace be to thee our friends salute thee greet the friends by name the servant of and brother of james to them that are sanctified by the father and preserved in
859,and called mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our into lasciviousness and denying the only lord and our lord i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day even as sodom and gomorrha and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities yet michael the
860,archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of core these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him
861,these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of advantage but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of looking for the mercy of our lord unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise our saviour be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen the of which gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his
862,angel unto his servant who bare record of the word of and of the testimony of and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto and his father to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to
863,come the almighty i who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of and for the testimony of i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto sardis and unto philadelphia and unto laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound
864,of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil

866,shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death and to the angel of the church in pergamos write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitanes which thing i hate repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them
867,with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it and unto the angel of the church in thyatira write these things saith the son of who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass i know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and i will kill her children with death and all
868,the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden but that which ye have already hold fast till i come and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father and i will give him the morning star he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and unto the angel of the church in sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of and the seven stars i know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die

871,that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spue thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches after
872,this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will shew thee things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald and round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion and the
873,second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord almighty which was and is and is to come and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven
874,nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for
875,thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and hast made us unto our kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honour and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of
876,the four beasts saying come and see and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and i looked and behold a pale
877,horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellowservants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she
878,is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither
879,the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our in their foreheads and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel of the tribe of juda were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of reuben were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of gad were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of aser were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of manasses were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of simeon were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of levi were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of issachar were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of zabulon were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of joseph were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of benjamin were sealed twelve thousand after this i beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands and cried with a loud voice
880,saying salvation to our which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb and all the angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might be unto our for ever and ever amen and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they and i said unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb therefore are they before the throne of and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
881,and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and i saw the seven angels which stood before and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before out of the angel's hand and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and
882,the third part of the sea became blood and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died and the third part of the ships were destroyed and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound and the fifth angel sounded
883,and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of in their foreheads and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads were as it were
884,crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle and they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months and they had a king over them which is the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon but in the greek tongue hath his name apollyon one woe is past and behold there come two woes more hereafter and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of
885,the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts 1and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and
886,a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire 1and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth 1and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices 1and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not 1and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven 1and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer 1but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of should be finished as he hath declared to his servants
887,the prophets 1and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth 1and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings 1and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of and the altar and them that worship therein 1but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two
888,months 1and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth 1these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the of the earth 1and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed 1these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will 1and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them 1and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord was crucified 1and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves and they
889,that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth and after three days and an half the spirit of life from entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them and the same hour was there a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the of heaven the second woe is past and behold the third woe cometh quickly and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his and he shall reign for ever and ever and the four and twenty elders which sat before on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped saying we give thee thanks o lord
890,almighty which art and wast and art to come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time of the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the saints and them that fear thy name small and great and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth and the temple of was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail 1and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars 1and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered 1and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads 1and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before
891,the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born 1and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto and to his throne 1and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days 1and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels 1and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven 1and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our and the power of his for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of
892,their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of and have the testimony of 1and i stood
893,upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy 1and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority 1and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast 1and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him 1and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months 1and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven 1and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and
894,power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations 1and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world 1if any man have an ear let him hear he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to
895,the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six 1and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion and with him an hundred forty and four thousand having his father's name written in their foreheads 1and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps 1and they sung as it
896,were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth 1these are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth these were redeemed from among men being the firstfruits unto and to the lamb 1and in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault before the throne of 1and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people 1saying with a loud voice fear and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters 1and there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication 1and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if
897,any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of and the faith of and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth yea saith the spirit that they may rest from their labours and their works do follow them and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle and another angel came out of the temple
898,crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time is come for thee to reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth and the earth was reaped and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle and another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs 1and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled
899,up the wrath of 1and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of 1and they sing the song of moses the servant of and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works lord almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints 1who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest 1and after that i looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened 1and the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed in pure and white linen and having their breasts girded with golden girdles 1and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of who liveth for ever and ever 1and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of
900,and from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled 1and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of upon the earth 1and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worshipped his image 1and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man and every living soul died in the sea 1and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood 1and i heard the angel of the waters say thou art righteous o lord which art and wast and shalt be because thou hast judged thus 1for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy 1and i heard another out of the altar say even so lord almighty
901,true and righteous are thy judgments 1and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire 1and men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of which hath power over these plagues and they repented not to give him glory and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast and his kingdom was full of darkness and they gnawed their tongues for pain and blasphemed the of heaven because of their pains and their sores and repented not of their deeds and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of almighty
902,behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath and every island fled away and the mountains were not found and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven every stone about the weight of a talent and men blasphemed because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great 1and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with
903,me saying unto me come hither i will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters 1with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication 1so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns 1and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication 1and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth 1and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration 1and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel i will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns
904,1the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is 1and here is the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth and there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with the beast these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the beast these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called
905,and chosen and faithful and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire for hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of shall be fulfilled and the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth 1and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory 1and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird 1for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through
906,the abundance of her delicacies 1and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues 1for her sins have reached unto heaven and hath remembered her iniquities 1reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double 1how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow 1therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the lord who judgeth her 1and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city babylon that mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come and the merchants of
907,the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise any more the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner vessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marble and cinnamon and odours and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing and saying alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls for in one hour so great riches is come to nought and every shipmaster and all the company in ships and sailors and as
908,many as trade by sea stood afar off and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like unto this great city and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great city wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness for in one hour is she made desolate rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets for hath avenged you on her and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all and the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall
909,be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth 1and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honour and power unto the lord our 1for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand 1and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up for ever and ever 1and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped that sat on the throne saying amen alleluia 1and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great 1and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord omnipotent reigneth
910,1let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready 1and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints 1and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of worship for the testimony of is the spirit of prophecy and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of and
911,the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army and the beast was taken and with him the
912,false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh 2and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand 2and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years 2and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season 2and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of and for the word of and which had not worshipped the beast neither his
913,image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with a thousand years 2but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection 2blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of and of and shall reign with him a thousand years 2and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison 2and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea 2and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city and fire came down from out of heaven and devoured them and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever and i saw
914,a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire 2and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea 2and i saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband 2and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold
915,the tabernacle of is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and himself shall be with them and be their 2and shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away 2and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful 2and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely 2he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his and he shall be my son 2but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death 2and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and
916,talked with me saying come hither i will shew thee the bride the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from having the glory of and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal and had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof and the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the breadth and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal
917,and he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty and four cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angel and the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolyte the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass and i saw no temple therein for the lord almighty and the lamb are the temple of it and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and
918,the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lamb's book of life 2and he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of and of the lamb 2in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations 2and there shall be no more curse but the throne of and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him 2and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads 2and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither
919,light of the sun for the lord giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever 2and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the lord of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done 2behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book 2and i saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things 2then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is

922,of actors of the shadows at the disposition of all underground tragedies they were in the habit of assembling at nightfall the hour when they woke up on the plains which adjoin the salpetriere there they held their conferences they had twelve black hours before them they regulated their employment accordingly patron minette such was the name which was bestowed in the subterranean circulation on the association of these four men in the fantastic ancient popular parlance which is vanishing day by day patron minette signifies the morning the same as entre chien et loup between dog and wolf signifies the evening this appellation patron minette was probably derived from the hour at which their work ended the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the separation of ruffians these four men were known under this title when the president of the assizes visited lacenaire in his prison and questioned him concerning a misdeed which lacenaire denied who did it demanded the president lacenaire made this response enigmatical so far as the magistrate was concerned but clear to the police perhaps it was patron minette a piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages in

924,in the abandoned quarries of montmatre or montrouge sometimes in the sewers they ran to earth what became of these men they still exist they have always existed horace speaks of them ambubaiarum collegia pharmacopolae mendici mimae and so long as society remains what it is they will remain what they are beneath the obscure roof of their cavern they are continually born again from the social ooze they return spectres but always identical only they no longer bear the same names and they are no longer in the same skins the individuals extirpated the tribe subsists they always have the same faculties from the vagrant to the tramp the race is maintained in its purity they divine purses in pockets they scent out watches in fobs gold and silver possess an odor for them there exist ingenuous bourgeois of whom it might be said that they have a stealable air these men patiently pursue these bourgeois they experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of a man from the country these men are terrible when one encounters them or catches a glimpse of them towards midnight on a deserted boulevard they do not
925,seem to be men but forms composed of living mists one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the shadows that they are in no wise distinct from them that they possess no other soul than the darkness and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living for a few minutes a monstrous life that they have separated from the night what is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish light light in floods not a single bat can resist the dawn light up society from below eighth the wicked poor man i marius while seeking a girl in a bonnet encounters a man in a cap summer passed then the autumn winter came neither m leblanc nor the young girl had again set foot in the luxembourg garden thenceforth marius had but one thought to gaze once more on that sweet and adorable face he sought constantly he sought everywhere he found nothing he was no longer marius the enthusiastic dreamer the firm resolute ardent man the bold defier of fate the brain which erected future on future the young spirit encumbered with plans with projects with pride with ideas and wishes he was
926,a lost dog he fell into a black melancholy all was over work disgusted him walking tired him vast nature formerly so filled with forms lights voices counsels perspectives horizons teachings now lay empty before him it seemed to him that everything had disappeared he thought incessantly for he could not do otherwise but he no longer took pleasure in his thoughts to everything that they proposed to him in a whisper he replied in his darkness what is the use he heaped a hundred reproaches on himself why did i follow her i was so happy at the mere sight of her she looked at me was not that immense she had the air of loving me was not that everything i wished to have what there was nothing after that i have been absurd it is my own fault etc etc courfeyrac to whom he confided nothing it was his nature but who made some little guess at everything that was his nature had begun by congratulating him on being in love though he was amazed at it then seeing marius fall into this melancholy state he ended by saying to him i see that you have been
927,simply an animal here come to the chaumiere once having confidence in a fine september sun marius had allowed himself to be taken to the ball at sceaux by courfeyrac bossuet and grantaire hoping what a dream that he might perhaps find her there of course he did not see the one he sought but this is the place all the same where all lost women are found grumbled grantaire in an aside marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot alone through the night weary feverish with sad and troubled eyes stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing creatures on their way home from the feast which passed close to him as he in his discouragement breathed in the acrid scent of the walnut trees along the road in order to refresh his head he took to living more and more alone utterly overwhelmed wholly given up to his inward anguish going and coming in his pain like the wolf in the trap seeking the absent one everywhere stupefied by love on another occasion he had an encounter which produced on him a singular effect he met in the
928,narrow streets in the vicinity of the boulevard des invalides a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a cap with a long visor which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white hair marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair and scrutinized the man who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation strange to say he thought that he recognized m leblanc the hair was the same also the profile so far as the cap permitted a view of it the mien identical only more depressed but why these workingman's clothes what was the meaning of this what signified that disguise marius was greatly astonished when he recovered himself his first impulse was to follow the man who knows whether he did not hold at last the clue which he was seeking in any case he must see the man near at hand and clear up the mystery but the idea occurred to him too late the man was no longer there he had turned into some little side street and marius could not find him this encounter occupied his mind for three days and then was effaced after all he said to
929,himself it was probably only a resemblance ii treasure trove marius had not left the gorbeau house he paid no attention to any one there at that epoch to tell the truth there were no other inhabitants in the house except himself and those jondrettes whose rent he had once paid without moreover ever having spoken to either father mother or daughters the other lodgers had moved away or had died or had been turned out in default of payment one day during that winter the sun had shown itself a little in the afternoon but it was the d of february that ancient candlemas day whose treacherous sun the precursor of a six weeks cold spell inspired mathieu laensberg with these two lines which have with justice remained classic qu'il luise ou qu'il luiserne l'ours rentre dans en sa caverne marius had just emerged from his night was falling it was the hour for his dinner for he had been obliged to take to dining again alas oh infirmities of ideal passions he had just crossed his threshold where ma'am bougon was sweeping at the moment as she uttered this memorable monologue what is there that is cheap now
930,everything is dear there is nothing in the world that is cheap except trouble you can get that for nothing the trouble of the world marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier in order to reach the rue saint jacques he was walking along with drooping head all at once he felt some one elbow him in the dusk he wheeled round and saw two young girls clad in rags the one tall and slim the other a little shorter who were passing rapidly all out of breath in terror and with the appearance of fleeing they had been coming to meet him had not seen him and had jostled him as they passed through the twilight marius could distinguish their livid faces their wild heads their dishevelled hair their hideous bonnets their ragged petticoats and their bare feet they were talking as they ran the taller said in a very low voice the bobbies have come they came near nabbing me at the half circle the other answered i saw them i bolted bolted bolted through this repulsive slang marius understood that gendarmes or the police had come near apprehending these two children and that the latter had
931,escaped they plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him and there created for a few minutes in the gloom a sort of vague white spot then disappeared marius had halted for a moment he was about to pursue his way when his eye lighted on a little grayish package lying on the ground at his feet he stooped and picked it up it was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers good he said to himself those unhappy girls dropped it he retraced his steps he called he did not find them he reflected that they must already be far away put the package in his pocket and went off to dine on the way he saw in an alley of the rue mouffetard a child's coffin covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs and illuminated by a candle the two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind poor mothers he thought there is one thing sadder than to see one's children die it is to see them leading an evil life then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his thoughts and he fell back once more into his habitual
932,preoccupations he fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness in the open air and the broad daylight beneath the beautiful trees of luxembourg how gloomy my life has become he said to himself young girls are always appearing to me only formerly they were angels and now they are ghouls iii quadrifrons that evening as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed his hand came in contact in the pocket of his coat with the packet which he had picked up on the boulevard he had forgotten it he thought that it would be well to open it and that this package might possibly contain the address of the young girls if it really belonged to them and in any case the information necessary to a restitution to the person who had lost it he opened the envelope it was not sealed and contained four letters also unsealed they bore addresses all four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco the first was addressed to madame madame la marquise de grucheray the place opposite the chamber of deputies no marius said to himself that he should probably find in it the information which he
933,sought and that moreover the letter being open it was probable that it could be read without impropriety it was conceived as follows madame la marquise the virtue of clemency and piety is that which most closely unites sosiety turn your christian spirit and cast a look of compassion on this unfortunate spanish victim of loyalty and attachment to the sacred cause of legitimacy who has given with his blood consecrated his fortune evverything to defend that cause and to day finds himself in the greatest missery he doubts not that your honorable person will grant succor to preserve an existence exteremely painful for a military man of education and honor full of wounds counts in advance on the humanity which animates you and on the interest which madame la marquise bears to a nation so unfortunate their prayer will not be in vain and their gratitude will preserve theirs charming souvenir my respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be madame don alvares spanish captain of cavalry a royalist who has take refuge in france who finds himself on travells for his country and the resources are lacking him to continue his travells no address was joined
934,to the signature marius hoped to find the address in the second letter whose superscription read a madame madame la comtesse de montvernet rue cassette no this is what marius read in it madame la comtesse it is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old i sick since my last confinement abandoned by my husband five months ago haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance in the hope of madame la comtesse she has the honor to be madame with profound respect mistress balizard marius turned to the third letter which was a petition like the preceding he read monsieur pabourgeot elector wholesale stocking merchant rue saint denis on the corner of the rue aux fers i permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me the pretious favor of your simpaties and to interest yourself in a man of letters who has just sent a drama to the theatre francais the subject is historical and the action takes place in auvergne in the time of the empire the style i think is natural laconic and may have some merit there are
935,couplets to be sung in four places the comic the serious the unexpected are mingled in a variety of characters and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue which proceeds misteriously and ends after striking altarations in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes my principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively animates the man of our century that is to say the fashion that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost every new wind in spite of these qualities i have reason to fear that jealousy the egotism of priviliged authors may obtaine my exclusion from the theatre for i am not ignorant of the mortifications with which new comers are treated monsiuer pabourgeot your just reputation as an enlightened protector of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will explain our indigant situation to you lacking bread and fire in this wynter season when i say to you that i beg you to accept the dedication of my drama which i desire to make to you and of all those that i shall make is to prove to you how great is my ambition to have
936,the honor of sheltering myself under your protection and of adorning my writings with your name if you deign to honor me with the most modest offering i shall immediately occupy myself in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude which i shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the drama and delivered on the stage to monsieur and madame pabourgeot my most respectful complements genflot man of letters p s even if it is only forty sous excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me alas to go out finally marius opened the fourth letter the address ran to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacquesdu haut pas it contained the following lines benevolent man if you deign to accompany my daughter you will behold a misserable calamity and i will show you my certificates at the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentiment of obvious benevolence for true philosophers always feel lively emotions admit compassionate man
937,that it is necessary to suffer the most cruel need and that it is very painful for the sake of obtaining a little relief to get oneself attested by the authorities as though one were not free to suffer and to die of inanition while waiting to have our misery relieved destinies are very fatal for several and too prodigal or too protecting for others i await your presence or your offering if you deign to make one and i beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be truly magnanimous man your very humble and very obedient servant p fabantou dramatic artist after perusing these four letters marius did not find himself much further advanced than before in the first place not one of the signers gave his address then they seemed to come from four different individuals don alveras mistress balizard the poet genflot and dramatic artist fabantou but the singular thing about these letters was that all four were written by the same hand what conclusion was to be drawn from this except that they all come from the same person moreover and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable
938,the coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four the odor of tobacco was the same and although an attempt had been made to vary the style the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity and the man of letters genflot was no more exempt from them than the spanish captain it was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery had it not been a chance find it would have borne the air of a mystification marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well and to lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous of playing with him it seemed to him that he was playing the part of the blind man in blind man's buff between the four letters and that they were making sport of him nothing however indicated that these letters belonged to the two young girls whom marius had met on the boulevard after all they were evidently papers of no value marius replaced them in their envelope flung the whole into a corner and went to bed about seven o'clock in the morning he had just risen and breakfasted and
939,was trying to settle down to work when there came a soft knock at his door as he owned nothing he never locked his door unless occasionally though very rarely when he was engaged in some pressing work even when absent he left his key in the lock you will be robbed said ma'am bougon of what said marius the truth is however that he had one day been robbed of an old pair of boots to the great triumph of ma'am bougon there came a second knock as gentle as the first come in said marius the door opened what do you want ma'am bougon asked marius without raising his eyes from the books and manuscripts on his table a voice which did not belong to ma'am bougon replied excuse me sir it was a dull broken hoarse strangled voice the voice of an old man roughened with brandy and liquor marius turned round hastily and beheld a young girl iv a rose in misery a very young girl was standing in the half open door the dormer window of the garret through which the light fell was precisely opposite the door and illuminated the figure with a wan
940,light she was a frail emaciated slender creature there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness her girdle was a string her head ribbon a string her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise a blond and lymphatic pallor earth colored collar bones red hands a half open and degraded mouth missing teeth dull bold base eyes she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth and the look of a corrupt old woman fifty years mingled with fifteen one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep marius had risen and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams the most heart breaking thing of all was that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely in her early childhood she must even have been pretty the grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty the remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen like the
941,pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winter's day that face was not wholly unknown to marius he thought he remembered having seen it somewhere what do you wish mademoiselle he asked the young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict here is a letter for you monsieur marius she called marius by his name he could not doubt that he was the person whom she wanted but who was this girl how did she know his name without waiting for him to tell her to advance she entered she entered resolutely staring with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed at the whole room and the unmade bed her feet were bare large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees she was shivering she held a letter in her hand which she presented to marius marius as he opened the letter noticed that the enormous wafer which sealed it was still moist the message could not have come from a distance he read my amiable neighbor young man i have learned of your goodness to me that you paid my rent six months
942,ago i bless you young man my eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days four persons and my spouse ill if i am not deseaved in my opinion i think i may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor i am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity jondrette p s my eldest daughter will await your orders dear monsieur marius this letter coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied marius thoughts ever since the preceding evening was like a candle in a cellar all was suddenly illuminated this letter came from the same place as the other four there was the same writing the same style the same orthography the same paper the same odor of tobacco there were five missives five histories five signatures and a single signer the spanish captain don alvares the unhappy mistress balizard the dramatic poet genflot the old comedian fabantou were all four named jondrette if indeed jondrette himself were
943,named jondrette marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time and he had had as we have said but very rare occasion to see to even catch a glimpse of his extremely mean neighbors his mind was elsewhere and where the mind is there the eyes are also he had been obliged more than once to pass the jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs but they were mere forms to him he had paid so little heed to them that on the preceding evening he had jostled the jondrette girls on the boulevard without recognizing them for it had evidently been they and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him in spite of disgust and pity a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere now he saw everything clearly he understood that his neighbor jondrette in his distress exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons that he procured addresses and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compassionate letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and peril for this father had
944,come to such a pass that he risked his daughters he was playing a game with fate and he used them as the stake marius understood that probably judging from their flight on the evening before from their breathless condition from their terror and from the words of slang which he had overheard these unfortunate creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession and that the result of the whole was in the midst of human society as it is now constituted two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women a species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery sad creatures without name or sex or age to whom neither good nor evil were any longer possible and who on emerging from childhood have already nothing in this world neither liberty nor virtue nor responsibility souls which blossomed out yesterday and are faded to day like those flowers let fall in the streets which are soiled with every sort of mire while waiting for some wheel to crush them nevertheless while marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity of a spectre she kicked
945,about without troubling herself as to her nakedness occasionally her chemise which was untied and torn fell almost to her waist she moved the chairs about she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode she handled marius clothes she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners hullo said she you have a mirror and she hummed scraps of vaudevilles as though she had been alone frolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious an indescribable constraint weariness and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood effrontery is a disgrace nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room and so to speak flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened by the daylight or which has broken its wing one felt that under other conditions of education and destiny the gay and over free mien of this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming never even among animals does the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey that is only to be seen among men marius reflected and allowed her to have her way she approached the table ah said she books a
946,flash pierced her glassy eye she resumed and her accent expressed the happiness which she felt in boasting of something to which no human creature is insensible i know how to read i do she eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table and read with tolerable fluency general bauduin received orders to take the chateau of hougomont which stands in the middle of the plain of waterloo with five battalions of his brigade she paused ah waterloo i know about that it was a battle long ago my father was there my father has served in the armies we are fine bonapartists in our house that we are waterloo was against the english she laid down the book caught up a pen and exclaimed and i know how to write too she dipped her pen in the ink and turning to marius do you want to see look here i'm going to write a word to show you and before he had time to answer she wrote on a sheet of white paper which lay in the middle of the table the bobbies are here then throwing down the pen there are no faults of orthography you
947,can look we have received an education my sister and i we have not always been as we are now we were not made here she paused fixed her dull eyes on marius and burst out laughing saying with an intonation which contained every form of anguish stifled by every form of cynicism bah and she began to hum these words to a gay air j'ai faim mon pere i am hungry father pas de fricot i have no food j'ai froid ma mere i am cold mother pas de tricot i have no clothes grelotte lolotte lolotte shiver sanglote sob jacquot jacquot she had hardly finished this couplet when she exclaimed do you ever go to the play monsieur marius i do i have a little brother who is a friend of the artists and who gives me tickets sometimes but i don't like the benches in the galleries one is cramped and uncomfortable there there are rough people there sometimes and people who smell bad then she scrutinized marius assumed a singular air and said do you know mr marius that you are a very handsome fellow and at the same moment the same idea occurred to them
948,both and made her smile and him blush she stepped up to him and laid her hand on his shoulder you pay no heed to me but i know you mr marius i meet you here on the staircase and then i often see you going to a person named father mabeuf who lives in the direction of austerlitz sometimes when i have been strolling in that quarter it is very becoming to you to have your hair tumbled thus she tried to render her voice soft but only succeeded in making it very deep a portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips as though on a piano where some notes are missing marius had retreated gently mademoiselle said he with his cool gravity i have here a package which belongs to you i think permit me to return it to you and he held out the envelope containing the four letters she clapped her hands and exclaimed we have been looking everywhere for that then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope saying as she did so dieu de dieu how my sister and i have hunted and it
949,was you who found it on the boulevard was it not it must have been on the boulevard you see we let it fall when we were running it was that brat of a sister of mine who was so stupid when we got home we could not find it anywhere as we did not wish to be beaten as that is useless as that is entirely useless as that is absolutely useless we said that we had carried the letters to the proper persons and that they had said to us nix so here they are those poor letters and how did you find out that they belonged to me ah yes the writing so it was you that we jostled as we passed last night we couldn't see i said to my sister is it a gentleman my sister said to me i think it is a gentleman in the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacquesdu haut pas here said she this is for that old fellow who goes to mass by the way this is his hour i'll go and carry it to him perhaps he
950,will give us something to breakfast on then she began to laugh again and added do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today it will mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday our breakfast of yesterday our dinner of to day and all that at once and this morning come parbleu if you are not satisfied dogs burst this reminded marius of the wretched girl's errand to himself he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and found nothing there the young girl went on and seemed to have no consciousness of marius presence i often go off in the evening sometimes i don't come home again last winter before we came here we lived under the arches of the bridges we huddled together to keep from freezing my little sister cried how melancholy the water is when i thought of drowning myself i said to myself no it's too cold i go out alone whenever i choose i sometimes sleep in the ditches do you know at night when i walk along the boulevard i see the trees like forks i see houses all black and as big as notre
951,dame i fancy that the white walls are the river i say to myself why there's water there the stars are like the lamps in illuminations one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out i am bewildered as though horses were breathing in my ears although it is night i hear hand organs and spinning machines and i don't know what all i think people are flinging stones at me i flee without knowing whither everything whirls and whirls you feel very queer when you have had no food and then she stared at him with a bewildered air by dint of searching and ransacking his pockets marius had finally collected five francs sixteen sous this was all he owned in the world for the moment at all events he thought there is my dinner for to day and to morrow we will see he kept the sixteen sous and handed the five francs to the young girl she seized the coin good said she the sun is shining and as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the avalanches of slang in her brain she went on five francs the shiner a
952,monarch in this hole ain't this fine you're a jolly thief i'm your humble servant bravo for the good fellows two days wine and meat and stew we'll have a royal feast and a good fill she pulled her chemise up on her shoulders made a low bow to marius then a familiar sign with her hand and went towards the door saying good morning sir it's all right i'll go and find my old man as she passed she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode which was moulding there amid the dust she flung herself upon it and bit into it muttering that's good it's hard it breaks my teeth then she departed v a providential peep hole marius had lived for five years in poverty in destitution even in distress but he now perceived that he had not known real misery true misery he had but just had a view of it was its spectre which had just passed before his eyes in fact he who has only beheld the misery of man has seen nothing the misery of woman is what he must see he who has seen only the misery of
953,woman has seen nothing he must see the misery of the child when a man has reached his last extremity he has reached his last resources at the same time woe to the defenceless beings who surround him work wages bread fire courage good will all fail him simultaneously the light of day seems extinguished without the moral light within in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of the woman and the child and bends them violently to ignominy then all horrors become possible despair is surrounded with fragile partitions which all open on either vice or crime health youth honor all the shy delicacies of the young body the heart virginity modesty that epidermis of the soul are manipulated in sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources which encounters opprobrium and which accommodates itself to it fathers mothers children brothers sisters men women daughters adhere and become incorporated almost like a mineral formation in that dusky promiscuousness of sexes relationships ages infamies and innocences they crouch back to back in a sort of hut of fate they exchange woe begone glances oh the unfortunate wretches how pale they are how cold they are it seems as though they
954,dwelt in a planet much further from the sun than ours this young girl was to marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad shadows she revealed to him a hideous side of the night marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revery and passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up to that day the payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement which any one would have yielded to but he marius should have done better than that what only a wall separated him from those abandoned beings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of the world he was elbow to elbow with them he was in some sort the last link of the human race which they touched he heard them live or rather rattle in the death agony beside him and he paid no heed to them every day every instant he heard them walking on the other side of the wall he heard them go and come and speak and he did not even lend an ear and groans lay in those words and he did not even listen to them
955,his thoughts were elsewhere given up to dreams to impossible radiances to loves in the air to follies and all the while human creatures his brothers in jesus christ his brothers in the people were agonizing in vain beside him he even formed a part of their misfortune and he aggravated it for if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive any ordinary and charitable man evidently their indigence would have been noticed their signals of distress would have been perceived and they would have been taken hold of and rescued they appeared very corrupt and very depraved no doubt very vile very odious even but those who fall without becoming degraded are rare besides there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word a fatal word the miserable whose fault is this and then should not the charity be all the more profound in proportion as the fall is great while reading himself this moral lesson for there were occasions on which marius like all truly honest hearts was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than he deserved he stared at the wall which
956,separated him from the jondrettes as though he were able to make his gaze full of pity penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people the wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams and as the reader had just learned it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished only a man as dreamy as marius could have failed to perceive this long before there was no paper pasted on the wall either on the side of the jondrettes or on that of marius the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness marius examined the partition almost unconsciously sometimes revery examines observes and scrutinizes as thought would all at once he sprang up he had just perceived near the top close to the ceiling a triangular hole which resulted from the space between three lathes the plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing and by mounting on the commode a view could be had through this aperture into the jondrettes attic commiseration has and should have its curiosity this aperture formed a sort of peep hole it is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor
957,it let us get some little idea of what these people are like thought marius and in what condition they are he climbed upon the commode put his eye to the crevice and looked vi the wild man in his lair cities like forests have their caverns in which all the most wicked and formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves only in cities that which thus conceals itself is ferocious unclean and petty that is to say ugly in forests that which conceals itself is ferocious savage and grand that is to say beautiful taking one lair with another the beast's is preferable to the man's caverns are better than hovels what marius now beheld was a hovel marius was poor and his chamber was poverty stricken but as his poverty was noble his garret was neat the den upon which his eye now rested was abject dirty fetid pestiferous mean sordid the only furniture consisted of a straw chair an infirm table some old bits of crockery and in two of the corners two indescribable pallets all the light was furnished by a dormer window of four panes draped with spiders webs through this aperture there penetrated just
958,enough light to make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom the walls had a leprous aspect and were covered with seams and scars like a visage disfigured by some horrible malady a repulsive moisture exuded from them obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon them the chamber which marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement this one was neither tiled nor planked its inhabitants stepped directly on the antique plaster of the hovel which had grown black under the long continued pressure of feet upon this uneven floor where the dirt seemed to be fairly incrusted and which possessed but one virginity that of the broom were capriciously grouped constellations of old shoes socks and repulsive rags however this room had a fireplace so it was let for forty francs a year there was every sort of thing in that fireplace a brazier a pot broken boards rags suspended from nails a bird cage ashes and even a little fire two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way one thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was that it was large it had projections and angles
959,and black holes the lower sides of roofs bays and promontories hence horrible unfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as one's fist wood lice as large as one's foot and perhaps even who knows some monstrous human beings must be hiding one of the pallets was near the door the other near the window one end of each touched the fireplace and faced marius in a corner near the aperture through which marius was gazing a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall and at its bottom in large letters was the inscription the dream this represented a sleeping woman and a child also asleep the child on the woman's lap an eagle in a cloud with a crown in his beak and the woman thrusting the crown away from the child's head without awaking the latter in the background napoleon in a glory leaning on a very blue column with a yellow capital ornamented with this inscription maringo austerlits iena wagramme elot beneath this frame a sort of wooden panel which was no longer than it was broad stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude
960,against the wall it had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to the wall of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side of some pier glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting to be rehung near the table upon which marius descried a pen ink and paper sat a man about sixty years of age small thin livid haggard with a cunning cruel and uneasy air a hideous scoundrel if lavater had studied this visage he would have found the vulture mingled with the attorney there the bird of prey and the pettifogger rendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other the pettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble the bird of prey making the pettifogger horrible this man had a long gray beard he was clad in a woman's chemise which allowed his hairy breast and his bare arms bristling with gray hair to be seen beneath this chemise muddy trousers and boots through which his toes projected were visible he had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking there was no bread in the hovel but there was still tobacco he was writing probably some more
961,letters like those which marius had read on the corner of the table lay an ancient dilapidated reddish volume and the size which was the antique mo of reading rooms betrayed a romance on the cover sprawled the following title printed in large capitals god the king honor and the ladies by ducray duminil as the man wrote he talked aloud and marius heard his words the idea that there is no equality even when you are dead just look at pere lachaise the great those who are rich are up above in the acacia alley which is paved they can reach it in a carriage the little people the poor the unhappy well what of them they are put down below where the mud is up to your knees in the damp places they are put there so that they will decay the sooner you cannot go to see them without sinking into the earth he paused smote the table with his fist and added as he ground his teeth oh i could eat the whole world a big woman who might be forty years of age or a hundred was crouching near the fireplace on her bare heels
962,she too was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched with bits of old cloth a coarse linen apron concealed the half of her petticoat although this woman was doubled up and bent together it could be seen that she was of very lofty stature she was a sort of giant beside her husband she had hideous hair of a reddish blond which was turning gray and which she thrust back from time to time with her enormous shining hands with their flat nails beside her on the floor wide open lay a book of the same form as the other and probably a volume of the same romance on one of the pallets marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale young girl who sat there half naked and with pendant feet and who did not seem to be listening or seeing or living no doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room she seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age on closer scrutiny it was evident that she really was fourteen she was the child who had said on the boulevard the evening before i bolted
963,bolted bolted she was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time then suddenly starts up rapidly it is indigence which produces these melancholy human plants these creatures have neither childhood nor youth at fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve at sixteen they seem twenty to day a little girl to morrow a woman one might say that they stride through life in order to get through with it the more speedily at this moment this being had the air of a child moreover no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling no handicraft no spinning wheel not a tool in one corner lay some ironmongery of dubious aspect it was the dull listlessness which follows despair and precedes the death agony marius gazed for a while at this gloomy interior more terrifying than the interior of a tomb for the human soul could be felt fluttering there and life was palpitating there the garret the cellar the lowly ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the social edifice is not exactly the sepulchre but only its antechamber but as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at the entrance
964,of their palaces it seems that death which stands directly side by side with them places its greatest miseries in that vestibule the man held his peace the woman spoke no word the young girl did not even seem to breathe the scratching of the pen on the paper was audible the man grumbled without pausing in his writing canaille canaille everybody is canaille this variation to solomon's exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman calm yourself my little friend she said don't hurt yourself my dear you are too good to write to all those people husband bodies press close to each other in misery as in cold but hearts draw apart this woman must have loved this man to all appearance judging from the amount of love within her but probably in the daily and reciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the whole group this had become extinct there no longer existed in her anything more than the ashes of affection for her husband nevertheless caressing appellations had survived as is often the case she called him my dear my little friend my good man etc with her mouth while her heart was silent the
965,man resumed his writing vii strategy and tactics marius with a load upon his breast was on the point of descending from the species of observatory which he had improvised when a sound attracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post the door of the attic had just burst open abruptly the eldest girl made her appearance on the threshold on her feet she had large coarse men's shoes bespattered with mud which had splashed even to her red ankles and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters marius had not seen it on her an hour previously but she had probably deposited it at his door in order that she might inspire the more pity and had picked it up again on emerging she entered pushed the door to behind her paused to take breath for she was completely breathless then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy he is coming the father turned his eyes towards her the woman turned her head the little sister did not stir who demanded her father the gentleman the philanthropist yes from the church of saint jacques yes that old fellow yes and he
966,is coming he is following me you are sure i am sure there truly he is coming he is coming in a fiacre in a fiacre he is rothschild the father rose how are you sure if he is coming in a fiacre how is it that you arrive before him you gave him our address at least did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the corridor on the right if he only does not make a mistake so you found him at the church did he read my letter what did he say to you ta ta ta said the girl how you do gallop on my good man see here i entered the church he was in his usual place i made him a reverence and i handed him the letter he read it and said to me where do you live my child i said monsieur i will show you he said to me no give me your address my daughter has some purchases to make i will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do i gave him the address when i mentioned
967,the house he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant then he said never mind i will come when the mass was finished i watched him leave the church with his daughter and i saw them enter a carriage i certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor on the right and what makes you think that he will come i have just seen the fiacre turn into the rue petit banquier that is what made me run so how do you know that it was the same fiacre because i took notice of the number so there what was the number good you are a clever girl the girl stared boldly at her father and showing the shoes which she had on her feet a clever girl possibly but i tell you i won't put these shoes on again and that i won't for the sake of my health in the first place and for the sake of cleanliness in the next i don't know anything more irritating than shoes that squelch and go ghi ghi ghi the whole time i prefer to go barefoot you are right said her father in a sweet tone which contrasted
968,with the young girl's rudeness but then you will not be allowed to enter churches for poor people must have shoes to do that one cannot go barefoot to the good god he added bitterly then returning to the subject which absorbed him so you are sure that he will come he is following on my heels said she the man started up a sort of illumination appeared on his countenance wife he exclaimed you hear here is the philanthropist extinguish the fire the stupefied mother did not stir the father with the agility of an acrobat seized a broken nosed jug which stood on the chimney and flung the water on the brands then addressing his eldest daughter here you pull the straw off that chair his daughter did not understand he seized the chair and with one kick he rendered it seatless his leg passed through it as he withdrew his leg he asked his daughter is it cold very cold it is snowing the father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the window and shouted to her in a thundering voice quick get off that bed you lazy thing will you never
969,do anything break a pane of glass the little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver break a pane he repeated the child stood still in bewilderment do you hear me repeated her father i tell you to break a pane the child with a sort of terrified obedience rose on tiptoe and struck a pane with her fist the glass broke and fell with a loud clatter good said the father he was grave and abrupt his glance swept rapidly over all the crannies of the garret one would have said that he was a general making the final preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of beginning the mother who had not said a word so far now rose and demanded in a dull slow languid voice whence her words seemed to emerge in a congealed state what do you mean to do my dear get into bed replied the man his intonation admitted of no deliberation the mother obeyed and threw herself heavily on one of the pallets in the meantime a sob became audible in one corner what's that cried the father the younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist without quitting
970,the corner in which she was cowering she had wounded herself while breaking the window she went off near her mother's pallet and wept silently it was now the mother's turn to start up and exclaim just see there what follies you commit she has cut herself breaking that pane for you so much the better said the man i foresaw that what so much the better retorted his wife peace replied the father i suppress the liberty of the press then tearing the woman's chemise which he was wearing he made a strip of cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl's bleeding wrist that done his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn chemise and the chemise too said he this has a good appearance an icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room the outer mist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers through the broken pane the snow could be seen falling the snow promised by the candlemas sun of the preceding day had actually come the father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had forgotten
971,nothing he seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet brands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them then drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney piece now said he we can receive the philanthropist viii the ray of light in the hovel the big girl approached and laid her hand in her father's feel how cold i am said she bah replied the father i am much colder than that the mother exclaimed impetuously you always have something better than any one else so you do even bad things down with you said the man the mother being eyed after a certain fashion held her tongue silence reigned for a moment in the hovel the elder girl was removing the mud from the bottom of her mantle with a careless air her younger sister continued to sob the mother had taken the latter's head between her hands and was covering it with kisses whispering to her the while my treasure i entreat you it is nothing of consequence don't cry you will anger your father no exclaimed the father quite the contrary sob sob that's right then turning to the elder there now he
972,is not coming what if he were not to come i shall have extinguished my fire wrecked my chair torn my shirt and broken my pane all for nothing and wounded the child murmured the mother do you know went on the father that it's beastly cold in this devil's garret what if that man should not come oh see there you he makes us wait he says to himself well they will wait for me that's what they're there for oh how i hate them and with what joy jubilation enthusiasm and satisfaction i could strangle all those rich folks all those rich folks these men who pretend to be charitable who put on airs who go to mass who make presents to the priesthood preachy preachy in their skullcaps and who think themselves above us and who come for the purpose of humiliating us and to bring us clothes as they say old duds that are not worth four sous and bread that's not what i want pack of rascals that they are it's money ah money never because they say that we would go off and drink it up and that we are drunkards and idlers and
973,they what are they then and what have they been in their time thieves they never could have become rich otherwise oh society ought to be grasped by the four corners of the cloth and tossed into the air all of it it would all be smashed very likely but at least no one would have anything and there would be that much gained but what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing will he come perhaps the animal has forgotten the address i'll bet that that old beast at that moment there came a light tap at the door the man rushed to it and opened it exclaiming amid profound bows and smiles of adoration enter sir deign to enter most respected benefactor and your charming young lady also a man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on the threshold of the attic marius had not quitted his post his feelings for the moment surpassed the powers of the human tongue it was she whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those three letters of that word she it was certainly she marius could hardly distinguish her through the luminous vapor
974,which had suddenly spread before his eyes it was that sweet absent being that star which had beamed upon him for six months it was those eyes that brow that mouth that lovely vanished face which had created night by its departure the vision had been eclipsed now it reappeared it reappeared in that gloom in that garret in that misshapen attic in all that horror marius shuddered in dismay what it was she the palpitations of his heart troubled his sight he felt that he was on the brink of bursting into tears what he beheld her again at last after having sought her so long it seemed to him that he had lost his soul and that he had just found it again she was the same as ever only a little pale her delicate face was framed in a bonnet of violet velvet her figure was concealed beneath a pelisse of black satin beneath her long dress a glimpse could be caught of her tiny foot shod in a silken boot she was still accompanied by m leblanc she had taken a few steps into the room and had deposited a tolerably bulky parcel on the table
975,the eldest jondrette girl had retired behind the door and was staring with sombre eyes at that velvet bonnet that silk mantle and that charming happy face ix jondrette comes near weeping the hovel was so dark that people coming from without felt on entering it the effect produced on entering a cellar the two new comers advanced therefore with a certain hesitation being hardly able to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them while they could be clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the garret who were accustomed to this twilight m leblanc approached with his sad but kindly look and said to jondrette the father monsieur in this package you will find some new clothes and some woollen stockings and blankets our angelic benefactor overwhelms us said jondrette bowing to the very earth then bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter while the two visitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior he added in a low and rapid voice hey what did i say duds no money they are all alike by the way how was the letter to that old blockhead signed fabantou replied the girl the dramatic artist good
976,it was lucky for jondrette that this had occurred to him for at the very moment m leblanc turned to him and said to him with the air of a person who is seeking to recall a name i see that you are greatly to be pitied monsieur fabantou replied jondrette quickly monsieur fabantou yes that is it i remember dramatic artist sir and one who has had some success here jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the philanthropist he exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same time of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs and the humility of the mendicant on the highway a pupil of talma sir i am a pupil of talma fortune formerly smiled on me alas now it is misfortune's turn you see my benefactor no bread no fire my poor babes have no fire my only chair has no seat a broken pane and in such weather my spouse in bed ill poor woman said m leblanc my child wounded added jondrette the child diverted by the arrival of the strangers had fallen to contemplating the young lady and had ceased to sob cry bawl said jondrette to her
977,in a low voice at the same time he pinched her sore hand all this was done with the talent of a juggler the little girl gave vent to loud shrieks the adorable young girl whom marius in his heart called his ursule approached her hastily poor dear child said she you see my beautiful young lady pursued jondrette her bleeding wrist it came through an accident while working at a machine to earn six sous a day it may be necessary to cut off her arm really said the old gentleman in alarm the little girl taking this seriously fell to sobbing more violently than ever alas yes my benefactor replied the father for several minutes jondrette had been scrutinizing the benefactor in a singular fashion as he spoke he seemed to be examining the other attentively as though seeking to summon up his recollections all at once profiting by a moment when the new comers were questioning the child with interest as to her injured hand he passed near his wife who lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air and said to her in a rapid but very low tone take a look at that
978,man then turning to m leblanc and continuing his lamentations you see sir all the clothing that i have is my wife's chemise and all torn at that in the depths of winter i can't go out for lack of a coat if i had a coat of any sort i would go and see mademoiselle mars who knows me and is very fond of me does she not still reside in the rue de la tour des dames do you know sir we played together in the provinces i shared her laurels celimene would come to my succor sir elmire would bestow alms on belisaire but no nothing and not a sou in the house my wife ill and not a sou my daughter dangerously injured not a sou my wife suffers from fits of suffocation it comes from her age and besides her nervous system is affected she ought to have assistance and my daughter also but the doctor but the apothecary how am i to pay them i would kneel to a penny sir such is the condition to which the arts are reduced and do you know my charming young lady and you my generous protector
979,do you know you who breathe forth virtue and goodness and who perfume that church where my daughter sees you every day when she says her prayers for i have brought up my children religiously sir i did not want them to take to the theatre ah the hussies if i catch them tripping i do not jest that i don't i read them lessons on honor on morality on virtue ask them they have got to walk straight they are none of your unhappy wretches who begin by having no family and end by espousing the public one is mamselle nobody and one becomes madame everybody deuce take it none of that in the fabantou family i mean to bring them up virtuously and they shall be honest and nice and believe in god by the sacred name well sir my worthy sir do you know what is going to happen to morrow to morrow is the fourth day of february the fatal day the last day of grace allowed me by my landlord if by this evening i have not paid my rent to morrow my oldest daughter my spouse with her fever my child with her wound
980,we shall all four be turned out of here and thrown into the street on the boulevard without shelter in the rain in the snow there sir i owe for four quarters a whole year that is to say sixty francs jondrette lied four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs and he could not owe four because six months had not elapsed since marius had paid for two m leblanc drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the table jondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter the scoundrel what does he think i can do with his five francs that won't pay me for my chair and pane of glass that's what comes of incurring expenses in the meanwhile m leblanc had removed the large brown great coat which he wore over his blue coat and had thrown it over the back of the chair monsieur fabantou he said these five francs are all that i have about me but i shall now take my daughter home and i will return this evening it is this evening that you must pay is it not jondrette's face lighted up with a
981,strange expression he replied vivaciously yes respected sir at eight o'clock i must be at my landlord's i will be here at six and i will fetch you the sixty francs my benefactor exclaimed jondrette overwhelmed and he added in a low tone take a good look at him wife m leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl once more and had turned towards the door farewell until this evening my friends said he six o'clock said jondrette six o'clock precisely at that moment the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the elder jondrette girl you are forgetting your coat sir said she jondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter accompanied by a formidable shrug of the shoulders m leblanc turned back and said with a smile i have not forgotten it i am leaving it o my protector said jondrette my august benefactor i melt into tears permit me to accompany you to your carriage if you come out answered m leblanc put on this coat it really is very cold jondrette did not need to be told twice he hastily donned the brown great coat and all three went out jondrette preceding
982,the two strangers x tariff of licensed cabs two francs an hour marius had lost nothing of this entire scene and yet in reality had seen nothing his eyes had remained fixed on the young girl his heart had so to speak seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of her very first step in that garret during her entire stay there he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and precipitates the whole soul on a single point he contemplated not that girl but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet the star sirius might have entered the room and he would not have been any more dazzled while the young girl was engaged in opening the package unfolding the clothing and the blankets questioning the sick mother kindly and the little injured girl tenderly he watched her every movement he sought to catch her words he knew her eyes her brow her beauty her form her walk he did not know the sound of her voice he had once fancied that he had caught a few words at the luxembourg but he was not absolutely sure of the fact
983,he would have given ten years of his life to hear it in order that he might bear away in his soul a little of that music but everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations and trumpet bursts of jondrette this added a touch of genuine wrath to marius ecstasy he devoured her with his eyes he could not believe that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of those vile creatures in that monstrous lair it seemed to him that he beheld a humming bird in the midst of toads when she took her departure he had but one thought to follow her to cling to her trace not to quit her until he learned where she lived not to lose her again at least after having so miraculously re discovered her he leaped down from the commode and seized his hat as he laid his hand on the lock of the door and was on the point of opening it a sudden reflection caused him to pause the corridor was long the staircase steep jondrette was talkative m leblanc had no doubt not yet regained his carriage if on turning round in the
984,corridor or on the staircase he were to catch sight of him marius in that house he would evidently take the alarm and find means to escape from him again and this time it would be final what was he to do should he wait a little but while he was waiting the carriage might drive off marius was perplexed at last he accepted the risk and quitted his room there was no one in the corridor he hastened to the stairs there was no one on the staircase he descended in all haste and reached the boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the rue du petit banquier on its way back to paris marius rushed headlong in that direction on arriving at the angle of the boulevard he caught sight of the fiacre again rapidly descending the rue mouffetard the carriage was already a long way off and there was no means of overtaking it what run after it impossible and besides the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre and the father would recognize him at that moment wonderful and unprecedented good
985,luck marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard there was but one thing to be done to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre that was sure efficacious and free from danger marius made the driver a sign to halt and called to him by the hour marius wore no cravat he had on his working coat which was destitute of buttons his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom the driver halted winked and held out his left hand to marius rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb what is it said marius pay in advance said the coachman marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him how much he demanded forty sous i will pay on my return the driver's only reply was to whistle the air of la palisse and to whip up his horse marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air for the lack of four and twenty sous he was losing his joy his happiness his love he had seen and he was becoming blind again he reflected bitterly and it must be confessed with profound regret on the five francs which he
986,had bestowed that very morning on that miserable girl if he had had those five francs he would have been saved he would have been born again he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness he would have made his escape from isolation and spleen from his widowed state he might have re knotted the black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden thread which had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same instant once more he returned to his hovel in despair he might have told himself that m leblanc had promised to return in the evening and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more skilfully so that he might follow him on that occasion but in his contemplation it is doubtful whether he had heard this as he was on the point of mounting the staircase he perceived on the other side of the boulevard near the deserted wall skirting the rue de la barriere des gobelins jondrette wrapped in the philanthropist's great coat engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting aspect who have been dubbed by common consent prowlers of the barriers
987,people of equivocal face of suspicious monologues who present the air of having evil minds and who generally sleep in the daytime which suggests the supposition that they work by night these two men standing there motionless and in conversation in the snow which was falling in whirlwinds formed a group that a policeman would surely have observed but which marius hardly noticed still in spite of his mournful preoccupation he could not refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom jondrette was talking resembled a certain panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille whom courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer this man's name the reader has learned in the preceding book this panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille figured later on in many criminal trials and became a notorious rascal he was at that time only a famous rascal to day he exists in the state of tradition among ruffians and assassins he was at the head of a school towards the end of the last reign and in the evening at nightfall at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers he was discussed at la force in
988,the fosse aux lions one might even in that prison precisely at the spot where the sewer which served the unprecedented escape in broad daylight of thirty prisoners in passes under the culvert read his name panchaud audaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of the sewer during one of his attempts at flight in the police already had their eye on him but he had not as yet made a serious beginning xi offers of service from misery to wretchedness marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps at the moment when he was about to re enter his cell he caught sight of the elder jondrette girl following him through the corridor the very sight of this girl was odious to him it was she who had his five francs it was too late to demand them back the cab was no longer there the fiacre was far away moreover she would not have given them back as for questioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been there that was useless it was evident that she did not know since the letter signed fabantou had been addressed to the benevolent
989,gentleman of the church of saint jacquesdu haut pas marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him it did not close he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door half open what is it he asked who is there it was the jondrette girl is it you resumed marius almost harshly still you what do you want with me she appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him she no longer had the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning she did not enter but held back in the darkness of the corridor where marius could see her through the half open door come now will you answer cried marius what do you want with me she raised her dull eyes in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely and said monsieur marius you look sad what is the matter with you with me said marius yes you there is nothing the matter with me yes there is no i tell you there is let me alone marius gave the door another push but she retained her hold on it stop said she you are in the wrong
990,although you are not rich you were kind this morning be so again now you gave me something to eat now tell me what ails you you are grieved that is plain i do not want you to be grieved what can be done for it can i be of any service employ me i do not ask for your secrets you need not tell them to me but i may be of use nevertheless i may be able to help you since i help my father when it is necessary to carry letters to go to houses to inquire from door to door to find out an address to follow any one i am of service well you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you and i will go and speak to the persons sometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons that suffices to let them understand matters and everything comes right make use of me an idea flashed across marius mind what branch does one disdain when one feels that one is falling he drew near to the jondrette girl listen he said to her she interrupted him with a gleam
991,of joy in her eyes oh yes do call me thou i like that better well he resumed thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and his daughter yes dost thou know their address no find it for me the jondrette's dull eyes had grown joyous and they now became gloomy is that what you want she demanded yes do you know them no that is to say she resumed quickly you do not know her but you wish to know her this them which had turned into her had something indescribably significant and bitter about it well can you do it said marius you shall have the beautiful lady's address there was still a shade in the words the beautiful lady which troubled marius he resumed never mind after all the address of the father and daughter their address indeed she gazed fixedly at him what will you give me anything you like anything i like yes you shall have the address she dropped her head then with a brusque movement she pulled to the door which closed behind her marius found himself alone he dropped into a chair with his head and both elbows on his bed absorbed
992,in thoughts which he could not grasp and as though a prey to vertigo all that had taken place since the morning the appearance of the angel her disappearance what that creature had just said to him a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair this was what filled his brain confusedly all at once he was violently aroused from his revery he heard the shrill hard voice of jondrette utter these words which were fraught with a strange interest for him i tell you that i am sure of it and that i recognized him of whom was jondrette speaking whom had he recognized m leblanc the father of his ursule what did jondrette know him was marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark to him was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved who that young girl was who her father was was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled was the veil about to be rent ah heavens he bounded rather than climbed upon his commode and resumed his post near the little
993,peep hole in the partition wall again he beheld the interior of jondrette's hovel xii the use made of m leblanc's five franc piece nothing in the aspect of the family was altered except that the wife and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and jackets two new blankets were thrown across the two beds jondrette had evidently just returned he still had the breathlessness of out of doors his daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace the elder engaged in dressing the younger's wounded hand his wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace with a face indicative of astonishment jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long strides his eyes were extraordinary the woman who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence of her husband turned to say what really you are sure sure eight years have passed but i recognize him ah i recognize him i knew him at once what didn't it force itself on you no but i told you pay attention why it is his figure it is his face only older there are people who do not grow old i
994,don't know how they manage it it is the very sound of his voice he is better dressed that is all ah you mysterious old devil i've got you that i have he paused and said to his daughters get out of here you it's queer that it didn't strike you they arose to obey the mother stammered with her injured hand the air will do it good said jondrette be off it was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to reply the two girls departed at the moment when they were about to pass through the door the father detained the elder by the arm and said to her with a peculiar accent you will be here at five o'clock precisely both of you i shall need you marius redoubled his attention on being left alone with his wife jondrette began to pace the room again and made the tour of it two or three times in silence then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman's chemise which he wore into his trousers all at once he turned to the female jondrette folded his arms and exclaimed
995,and would you like to have me tell you something the young lady well what retorted his wife the young lady marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking he listened with ardent anxiety his whole life was in his ears but jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper then he straightened himself up and concluded aloud it is she that one said his wife that very one said the husband no expression can reproduce the significance of the mother's words surprise rage hate wrath were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation the pronunciation of a few words the name no doubt which her husband had whispered in her ear had sufficed to rouse this huge somnolent woman and from being repulsive she became terrible it is not possible she cried when i think that my daughters are going barefoot and have not a gown to their backs what a satin pelisse a velvet bonnet boots and everything more than two hundred francs worth of clothes so that one would think she was a lady no you are mistaken why in the first place the other was hideous
996,and this one is not so bad looking she really is not bad looking it can't be she i tell you that it is she you will see at this absolute assertion the jondrette woman raised her large red blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression at that moment she seemed to marius even more to be feared than her husband she was a sow with the look of a tigress what she resumed that horrible beautiful young lady who gazed at my daughters with an air of pity she is that beggar brat oh i should like to kick her stomach in for her she sprang off of the bed and remained standing for a moment her hair in disorder her nostrils dilating her mouth half open her fists clenched and drawn back then she fell back on the bed once more the man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female after a silence lasting several minutes he approached the female jondrette and halted in front of her with folded arms as he had done a moment before and shall i tell you another thing what is it she asked he
997,answered in a low curt voice my fortune is made the woman stared at him with the look that signifies is the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad he went on thunder it was not so very long ago that i was a parishioner of the parish of die of hunger if you have a fire die of cold if you have bread i have had enough of misery my share and other people's share i am not joking any longer i don't find it comic any more i've had enough of puns good god no more farces eternal father i want to eat till i am full i want to drink my fill to gormandize to sleep to do nothing i want to have my turn so i do come now before i die i want to be a bit of a millionnaire he took a turn round the hovel and added like other people what do you mean by that asked the woman he shook his head winked screwed up one eye and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration what do i mean by that
998,listen hush muttered the woman not so loud these are matters which must not be overheard bah who's here our neighbor i saw him go out a little while ago besides he doesn't listen the big booby and i tell you that i saw him go out nevertheless by a sort of instinct jondrette lowered his voice although not sufficiently to prevent marius hearing his words one favorable circumstance which enabled marius not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard this is what marius heard listen carefully the croesus is caught or as good as caught that's all settled already everything is arranged i have seen some people he will come here this evening at six o'clock to bring sixty francs the rascal did you notice how i played that game on him my sixty francs my landlord my fourth of february i don't even owe for one quarter isn't he a fool so he will come at six o'clock that's the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner mother bougon is off washing dishes in the city there's not a soul in the house the
999,neighbor never comes home until eleven o'clock the children shall stand on watch you shall help us he will give in and what if he does not give in demanded his wife jondrette made a sinister gesture and said we'll fix him and he burst out laughing this was the first time marius had seen him laugh the laugh was cold and sweet and provoked a shudder jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace and drew from it an old cap which he placed on his head after brushing it with his sleeve now said he i'm going out i have some more people that i must see good ones you'll see how well the whole thing will work i shall be away as short a time as possible it's a fine stroke of business do you look after the house and with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers he stood for a moment in thought then exclaimed do you know it's mighty lucky by the way that he didn't recognize me if he had recognized me on his side he would not have come back again he would have slipped through our fingers it was my
1000,beard that saved us my romantic beard my pretty little romantic beard and again he broke into a laugh he stepped to the window the snow was still falling and streaking the gray of the sky what beastly weather said he then lapping his overcoat across his breast this rind is too large for me never mind he added he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me the old scoundrel if it hadn't been for that i couldn't have gone out and everything would have gone wrong what small points things hang on anyway and pulling his cap down over his eyes he quitted the room he had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door when the door opened again and his savage but intelligent face made its appearance once more in the opening i came near forgetting said he you are to have a brazier of charcoal ready and he flung into his wife's apron the five franc piece which the philanthropist had left with him a brazier of charcoal asked his wife yes how many bushels two good ones that will come to thirty sous with the rest i will
1001,buy something for dinner the devil no why don't go and spend the hundred sou piece why because i shall have to buy something too what something how much shall you need whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger's shop rue mouffetard ah yes at the corner of a street i can see the shop but tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase fifty sous three francs there won't be much left for dinner eating is not the point to day there's something better to be done that's enough my jewel at this word from his wife jondrette closed the door again and this time marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel and descend the staircase rapidly at that moment one o'clock struck from the church of saint medard xiii solus cum solo in loco remoto non cogitabuntur orare pater noster marius dreamer as he was was as we have said firm and energetic by nature his habits of solitary meditation while they had developed in him sympathy and compassion had perhaps diminished the faculty for irritation but had left intact the power of waxing indignant he had
1002,the kindliness of a brahmin and the severity of a judge he took pity upon a toad but he crushed a viper now it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes these wretches must be stamped upon said he not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been elucidated on the contrary all of them had been rendered more dense if anything he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the luxembourg and the man whom he called m leblanc except that jondrette was acquainted with them athwart the mysterious words which had been uttered the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course of preparation a dark but terrible trap that both of them were incurring great danger she probably her father certainly that they must be saved that the hideous plots of the jondrettes must be thwarted and the web of these spiders broken he scanned the female jondrette for a moment she had pulled an old sheet iron stove from a corner and
1003,she was rummaging among the old heap of iron he descended from the commode as softly as possible taking care not to make the least noise amid his terror as to what was in preparation and in the horror with which the jondrettes had inspired him he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved but how was it to be done how warn the persons threatened he did not know their address they had reappeared for an instant before his eyes and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of paris should he wait for m leblanc at the door that evening at six o'clock at the moment of his arrival and warn him of the trap but jondrette and his men would see him on the watch the spot was lonely they were stronger than he they would devise means to seize him or to get him away and the man whom marius was anxious to save would be lost one o'clock had just struck the trap was to be sprung at six marius had five hours before
1004,him there was but one thing to be done he put on his decent coat knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck took his hat and went out without making any more noise than if he had been treading on moss with bare feet moreover the jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron once outside of the house he made for the rue du petit banquier he had almost reached the middle of this street near a very low wall which a man can easily step over at certain points and which abuts on a waste space and was walking slowly in consequence of his preoccupied condition and the snow deadened the sound of his steps all at once he heard voices talking very close by he turned his head the street was deserted there was not a soul in it it was broad daylight and yet he distinctly heard voices it occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting there in fact sat two men flat on the snow with their backs against the wall talking together in subdued tones these two persons were strangers to him one was a bearded man in
1005,a blouse and the other a long haired individual in rags the bearded man had on a fez the other's head was bare and the snow had lodged in his hair by thrusting his head over the wall marius could hear their remarks the hairy one jogged the other man's elbow and said with the assistance of patron minette it can't fail do you think so said the bearded man and the long haired one began again it's as good as a warrant for each one of five hundred balls and the worst that can happen is five years six years ten years at the most the other replied with some hesitation and shivering beneath his fez that's a real thing you can't go against such things i tell you that the affair can't go wrong resumed the long haired man father what's his name's team will be already harnessed then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the preceding evening at the gaite theatre marius went his way it seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men so strangely hidden behind that wall and crouching in the snow could not but bear some
1006,relation to jondrette's abominable projects that must be the affair he directed his course towards the faubourg saint marceau and asked at the first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police he was directed to rue de pontoise no thither marius betook himself as he passed a baker's shop he bought a two penny roll and ate it foreseeing that he should not dine on the way he rendered justice to providence he reflected that had he not given his five francs to the jondrette girl in the morning he would have followed m leblanc's fiacre and consequently have remained ignorant of everything and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the jondrettes and that m leblanc would have been lost and his daughter with him no doubt xiv in which a police agent bestows two fistfuls on a lawyer on arriving at no rue de pontoise he ascended to the first floor and inquired for the commissary of police the commissary of police is not here said a clerk but there is an inspector who takes his place would you like to speak to him are you in haste yes
1007,said marius the clerk introduced him into the commissary's office there stood a tall man behind a grating leaning against a stove and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast topcoat with three collars his face was square with a thin firm mouth thick gray and very ferocious whiskers and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out of that glance it might have been well said not that it penetrated but that it searched this man's air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than jondrette's the dog is at times no less terrible to meet than the wolf what do you want he said to marius without adding monsieur is this monsieur le commissaire de police he is absent i am here in his stead the matter is very private then speak and great haste is required then speak quick this calm abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the same time he inspired fear and confidence marius related the adventure to him that a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening that as
1008,he occupied the room adjoining the den he marius pontmercy a lawyer had heard the whole plot through the partition that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain jondrette that there would be accomplices probably some prowlers of the barriers among others a certain panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille that jondrette's daughters were to lie in wait that there was no way of warning the threatened man since he did not even know his name and that finally all this was to be carried out at six o'clock that evening at the most deserted point of the boulevard de l'hopital in house no at the sound of this number the inspector raised his head and said coldly so it is in the room at the end of the corridor precisely answered marius and he added are you acquainted with that house the inspector remained silent for a moment then replied as he warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove apparently he went on muttering between his teeth and not addressing marius so much as his cravat patron minette must have had a hand in this this word struck marius patron minette said
1009,he i did hear that word pronounced in fact and he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long haired man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the rue du petit banquier the inspector muttered the long haired man must be brujon and the bearded one demi liard alias deux milliards he had dropped his eyelids again and became absorbed in thought as for father what's his name i think i recognize him here i've burned my coat they always have too much fire in these cursed stoves number former property of gorbeau then he glanced at marius you saw only that bearded and that long haired man and panchaud you didn't see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises no nor a big lump of matter resembling an elephant in the jardin des plantes no nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail no as for the fourth no one sees him not even his adjutants clerks and employees it is not surprising that you did not see him no who are all those persons asked marius the inspector answered besides this is not the time for
1010,them he relapsed into silence then resumed i know that barrack impossible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists seeing us and then they will get off simply by countermanding the vaudeville they are so modest an audience embarrasses them none of that none of that i want to hear them sing and make them dance this monologue concluded he turned to marius and demanded gazing at him intently the while are you afraid of what said marius of these men no more than yourself retorted marius rudely who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said monsieur to him the inspector stared still more intently at marius and continued with sententious solemnity there you speak like a brave man and like an honest man courage does not fear crime and honesty does not fear authority marius interrupted him that is well but what do you intend to do the inspector contented himself with the remark the lodgers have pass keys with which to get in at night you must have one yes said marius have you it about you yes give it to me said the inspector marius took his key from his waistcoat
1011,pocket handed it to the inspector and added if you will take my advice you will come in force the inspector cast on marius such a glance as voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him with one movement he plunged his hands which were enormous into the two immense pockets of his top coat and pulled out two small steel pistols of the sort called knock me downs then he presented them to marius saying rapidly in a curt tone take these go home hide in your chamber so that you may be supposed to have gone out they are loaded each one carries two balls you will keep watch there is a hole in the wall as you have informed me these men will come leave them to their own devices for a time when you think matters have reached a crisis and that it is time to put a stop to them fire a shot not too soon the rest concerns me a shot into the ceiling the air no matter where above all things not too soon wait until they begin to put their project into execution you are
1012,a lawyer you know the proper point marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat that makes a lump that can be seen said the inspector put them in your trousers pocket marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets now pursued the inspector there is not a minute more to be lost by any one what time is it half past two seven o'clock is the hour six o'clock answered marius i have plenty of time said the inspector but no more than enough don't forget anything that i have said to you bang a pistol shot rest easy said marius and as marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out the inspector called to him by the way if you have occasion for my services between now and then come or send here you will ask for inspector javert xv jondrette makes his purchases a few moments later about three o'clock courfeyrac chanced to be passing along the rue mouffetard in company with bossuet the snow had redoubled in violence and filled the air bossuet was just saying to courfeyrac one would say to see all
1013,these snow flakes fall that there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven all at once bossuet caught sight of marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar air hold said bossuet there's marius i saw him said courfeyrac don't let's speak to him why he is busy with what don't you see his air what air he has the air of a man who is following some one that's true said bossuet just see the eyes he is making said courfeyrac but who the deuce is he following some fine flowery bonneted wench he's in love but observed bossuet i don't see any wench nor any flowery bonnet in the street there's not a woman round courfeyrac took a survey and exclaimed he's following a man a man in fact wearing a gray cap and whose gray beard could be distinguished although they only saw his back was walking along about twenty paces in advance of marius this man was dressed in a great coat which was perfectly new and too large for him and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with mud bossuet burst out laughing who is
1014,that man he retorted courfeyrac he's a poet poets are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of france let's see where marius will go said bossuet let's see where the man is going let's follow them hey bossuet exclaimed courfeyrac eagle of meaux you are a prodigious brute follow a man who is following another man indeed they retraced their steps marius had in fact seen jondrette passing along the rue mouffetard and was spying on his proceedings jondrette walked straight ahead without a suspicion that he was already held by a glance he quitted the rue mouffetard and marius saw him enter one of the most terrible hovels in the rue gracieuse he remained there about a quarter of an hour then returned to the rue mouffetard he halted at an ironmonger's shop which then stood at the corner of the rue pierre lombard and a few minutes later marius saw him emerge from the shop holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle which he concealed beneath his great coat at the top of the rue petit gentilly he turned to the left
1015,and proceeded rapidly to the rue du petit banquier the day was declining the snow which had ceased for a moment had just begun again marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the rue du petit banquier which was deserted as usual and did not follow jondrette into it it was lucky that he did so for on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where marius had heard the long haired man and the bearded man conversing jondrette turned round made sure that no one was following him did not see him then sprang across the wall and disappeared the waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of an ex livery stable keeper of bad repute who had failed and who still kept a few old single seated berlins under his sheds marius thought that it would be wise to profit by jondrette's absence to return home moreover it was growing late every evening ma'am bougon when she set out for her dish washing in town had a habit of locking the door which was always closed at dusk marius had given his key to the inspector of police it was
1016,important therefore that he should make haste evening had arrived night had almost closed in on the horizon and in the immensity of space there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun and that was the moon it was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of salpetriere marius returned to no with great strides the door was still open when he arrived he mounted the stairs on tip toe and glided along the wall of the corridor to his chamber this corridor as the reader will remember was bordered on both sides by attics all of which were for the moment empty and to let ma'am bougon was in the habit of leaving all the doors open as he passed one of these attics marius thought he perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight falling through a dormer window marius made no attempt to see not wishing to be seen himself he succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making any noise it was high time a moment later he heard ma'am bougon take her departure locking the door of the
1017,house behind her xvi in which will be found the words to an english air which was in fashion in marius seated himself on his bed it might have been half past five o'clock only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen he heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark he thought of the double march which was going on at that moment in the dark crime advancing on one side justice coming up on the other he was not afraid but he could not think without a shudder of what was about to take place as is the case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure the entire day produced upon him the effect of a dream and in order to persuade himself that he was not the prey of a nightmare he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pockets it was no longer snowing the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly from the mist and its light mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen communicated to the chamber
1018,a sort of twilight aspect there was a light in the jondrette den marius saw the hole in the wall shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him it was true that the light could not be produced by a candle however there was not a sound in the jondrette quarters not a soul was moving there not a soul speaking not a breath the silence was glacial and profound and had it not been for that light he might have thought himself next door to a sepulchre marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed several minutes elapsed marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges a heavy step mounted the staircase and hastened along the corridor the latch of the hovel was noisily lifted it was jondrette returning instantly several voices arose the whole family was in the garret only it had been silent in the master's absence like wolf whelps in the absence of the wolf it's i said he good evening daddy yelped the girls well said the mother all's going first rate responded jondrette but my feet are beastly cold good you have dressed up you have done well
1019,you must inspire confidence all ready to go out don't forget what i told you you will do everything sure rest easy because said jondrette and he left the phrase unfinished marius heard him lay something heavy on the table probably the chisel which he had purchased by the way said jondrette have you been eating here yes said the mother i got three large potatoes and some salt i took advantage of the fire to cook them good returned jondrette to morrow i will take you out to dine with me we will have a duck and fixings you shall dine like charles the tenth all is going well then he added the mouse trap is open the cats are there he lowered his voice still further and said put this in the fire marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some iron utensil and jondrette continued have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak yes replied the mother what time is it nearly six the half hour struck from saint medard a while ago the devil ejaculated jondrette the children must go and watch come you do
1020,you listen here a whispering ensued jondrette's voice became audible again has old bougon left yes said the mother are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor's room he has not been in all day and you know very well that this is his dinner hour you are sure sure all the same said jondrette there's no harm in going to see whether he is there here my girl take the candle and go there marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed hardly had he concealed himself when he perceived a light through the crack of his door p'pa cried a voice he is not in here he recognized the voice of the eldest daughter did you go in demanded her father no replied the girl but as his key is in the door he must be out the father exclaimed go in nevertheless the door opened and marius saw the tall jondrette come in with a candle in her hand she was as she had been in the morning only still more repulsive in this light she walked straight up to the bed marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety
1021,but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall and it was thither that she was directing her steps she raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it in the neighboring room the sound of iron articles being moved was audible she smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand and smiled into the mirror humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice nos amours ont dure toute une semaine mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts s'adorer huit jours c etait bien la peine le temps des amours devait durer toujours devrait durer toujours devrait durer toujours in the meantime marius trembled it seemed impossible to him that she should not hear his breathing she stepped to the window and looked out with the half foolish way she had how ugly paris is when it has put on a white chemise said she she returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it scrutinizing herself full face and three quarters face in turn well cried her father what are you about there i am looking under the bed and the furniture she replied continuing to arrange her hair there's
1022,no one here booby yelled her father come here this minute and don't waste any time about it coming coming said she one has no time for anything in this hovel she hummed vous me quittez pour aller a la gloire mon triste coeur suivra partout she cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out shutting the door behind her a moment more and marius heard the sound of the two young girls bare feet in the corridor and jondrette's voice shouting to them pay strict heed one on the side of the barrier the other at the corner of the rue du petit banquier don't lose sight for a moment of the door of this house and the moment you see anything rush here on the instant as hard as you can go you have a key to get in the eldest girl grumbled the idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot to morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots said the father they ran down stairs and a few seconds later the shock of the outer door as it banged to announced that they were outside there now remained in the house
1023,only marius the jondrettes and probably also the mysterious persons of whom marius had caught a glimpse in the twilight behind the door of the unused attic xvii the use made of marius five franc piece marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his post at his observatory in a twinkling and with the agility of his age he had reached the hole in the partition he looked the interior of the jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect and marius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed a candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris but that was not what really lighted the chamber the hovel was completely illuminated as it were by the reflection from a rather large sheet iron brazier standing in the fireplace and filled with burning charcoal the brazier prepared by the jondrette woman that morning the charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red a blue flame flickered over it and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by jondrette in the rue pierre lombard where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat in one corner near
1024,the door and as though prepared for some definite use two heaps were visible which appeared to be the one a heap of old iron the other a heap of ropes all this would have caused the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation to waver between a very sinister and a very simple idea the lair thus lighted up more resembled a forge than a mouth of hell but jondrette in this light had rather the air of a demon than of a smith the heat of the brazier was so great that the candle on the table was melting on the side next the chafing dish and was drooping over an old dark lantern of copper worthy of diogenes turned cartouche stood on the chimney piece the brazier placed in the fireplace itself beside the nearly extinct brands sent its vapors up the chimney and gave out no odor the moon entering through the four panes of the window cast its whiteness into the crimson and flaming garret and to the poetic spirit of marius who was dreamy even in the moment of action it was like a thought of heaven mingled with
1025,the misshapen reveries of earth a breath of air which made its way in through the open pane helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the brazier the jondrette lair was if the reader recalls what we have said of the gorbeau building admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent and sombre deed and as the envelope for a crime it was the most retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted boulevard in paris if the system of ambush and traps had not already existed they would have been invented there the whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited rooms separated this den from the boulevard and the only window that existed opened on waste lands enclosed with walls and palisades jondrette had lighted his pipe seated himself on the seatless chair and was engaged in smoking his wife was talking to him in a low tone if marius had been courfeyrac that is to say one of those men who laugh on every occasion in life he would have burst with laughter when his gaze fell on the jondrette woman she had
1026,on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds at arms at the coronation of charles x an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat and the man's shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning it was this toilette which had extracted from jondrette the exclamation good you have dressed up you have done well you must inspire confidence as for jondrette he had not taken off the new surtout which was too large for him and which m leblanc had given him and his costume continued to present that contrast of coat and trousers which constituted the ideal of a poet in courfeyrac's eyes all at once jondrette lifted up his voice by the way now that i think of it in this weather he will come in a carriage light the lantern take it and go down stairs you will stand behind the lower door the very moment that you hear the carriage stop you will open the door instantly he will come up you will light the staircase and the corridor and when he enters here you will go down stairs again as speedily as possible you will pay the coachman
1027,and dismiss the fiacre and the money inquired the woman jondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs what's this she exclaimed jondrette replied with dignity that is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning and he added do you know what two chairs will be needed here what for to sit on marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild answer from jondrette pardieu i'll go and get one of our neighbor's and with a rapid movement she opened the door of the den and went out into the corridor marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode reach his bed and conceal himself beneath it take the candle cried jondrette no said she it would embarrass me i have the two chairs to carry there is moonlight marius heard mother jondrette's heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the dark the door opened he remained nailed to the spot with the shock and with horror the jondrette entered the dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between two blocks of shadow one of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the wall against
1028,which marius was leaning so that he disappeared within it mother jondrette raised her eyes did not see marius took the two chairs the only ones which marius possessed and went away letting the door fall heavily to behind her she re entered the lair here are the two chairs and here is the lantern go down as quick as you can she hastily obeyed and jondrette was left alone he placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table turned the chisel in the brazier set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the chafing dish then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope and bent down as though to examine something marius then recognized the fact that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a very well made rope ladder with wooden rungs and two hooks with which to attach it this ladder and some large tools veritable masses of iron which were mingled with the old iron piled up behind the door had not been in the jondrette hovel in the morning and had evidently been brought thither in the afternoon during marius absence those are the utensils
1029,of an edge tool maker thought marius had marius been a little more learned in this line he would have recognized in what he took for the engines of an edge tool maker certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock and others which will cut or slice the two families of tools which burglars call cadets and fauchants the fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite marius the brazier being concealed the only light in the room was now furnished by the candle the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the chimney piece cast a large shadow there was something indescribably calm threatening and hideous about this chamber one felt that there existed in it the anticipation of something terrible jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out a serious sign of preoccupation and had again seated himself the candle brought out the fierce and the fine angles of his countenance he indulged in scowls and in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand as though he were responding to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue in the course of one of these dark replies which he was making to himself
1030,he pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him took out a long kitchen knife which was concealed there and tried the edge of its blade on his nail that done he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it marius on his side grasped the pistol in his right pocket drew it out and cocked it the pistol emitted a sharp clear click as he cocked it jondrette started half rose listened a moment then began to laugh and said what a fool i am it's the partition cracking marius kept the pistol in his hand xviii marius two chairs form a vis a vis suddenly the distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook the panes six o'clock was striking from saint medard jondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head when the sixth had struck he snuffed the candle with his fingers then he began to pace up and down the room listened at the corridor walked on again then listened once more provided only that he comes he muttered then he returned to his chair he had hardly reseated himself when the door opened mother jondrette had opened it and now remained
1031,in the corridor making a horrible amiable grimace which one of the holes of the dark lantern illuminated from below enter sir she said enter my benefactor repeated jondrette rising hastily m leblanc made his appearance he wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable he laid four louis on the table monsieur fabantou said he this is for your rent and your most pressing necessities we will attend to the rest hereafter may god requite it to you my generous benefactor said jondrette and rapidly approaching his wife dismiss the carriage she slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offering m leblanc a chair an instant later she returned and whispered in his ear tis done the snow which had not ceased falling since the morning was so deep that the arrival of the fiacre had not been audible and they did not now hear its departure meanwhile m leblanc had seated himself jondrette had taken possession of the other chair facing m leblanc now in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow let the reader picture to himself in his own mind a cold night the solitudes of the
1032,salpetriere covered with snow and white as winding sheets in the moonlight the taper like lights of the street lanterns which shone redly here and there along those tragic boulevards and the long rows of black elms not a passer by for perhaps a quarter of a league around the gorbeau hovel at its highest pitch of silence of horror and of darkness in that building in the midst of those solitudes in the midst of that darkness the vast jondrette garret lighted by a single candle and in that den two men seated at a table m leblanc tranquil jondrette smiling and alarming the jondrette woman the female wolf in one corner and behind the partition marius invisible erect not losing a word not missing a single movement his eye on the watch and pistol in hand however marius experienced only an emotion of horror but no fear he clasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured i shall be able to stop that wretch whenever i please he thought he felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade waiting for the signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm moreover he was in
1033,hopes that this violent encounter between jondrette and m leblanc would cast some light on all the things which he was interested in learning xix occupying one's self with obscure depths hardly was m leblanc seated when he turned his eyes towards the pallets which were empty how is the poor little wounded girl he inquired bad replied jondrette with a heart broken and grateful smile very bad my worthy sir her elder sister has taken her to the bourbe to have her hurt dressed you will see them presently they will be back immediately madame fabantou seems to me to be better went on m leblanc casting his eyes on the eccentric costume of the jondrette woman as she stood between him and the door as though already guarding the exit and gazed at him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat she is dying said jondrette but what do you expect sir she has so much courage that woman has she's not a woman she's an ox the jondrette touched by his compliment deprecated it with the affected airs of a flattered monster you are always too good to me monsieur jondrette jondrette said m leblanc
1034,i thought your name was fabantou fabantou alias jondrette replied the husband hurriedly an artistic sobriquet and launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which m leblanc did not catch he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection of voice ah we have had a happy life together this poor darling and i what would there be left for us if we had not that we are so wretched my respectable sir we have arms but there is no work we have the will no work i don't know how the government arranges that but on my word of honor sir i am not jacobin sir i am not a bousingot i don't wish them any evil but if i were the ministers on my most sacred word things would be different here for instance i wanted to have my girls taught the trade of paper box makers you will say to me what a trade yes a trade a simple trade a bread winner what a fall my benefactor what a degradation when one has been what we have been alas there is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity one thing only a picture
1035,of which i think a great deal but which i am willing to part with for i must live item one must live while jondrette thus talked with an apparent incoherence which detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his physiognomy marius raised his eyes and perceived at the other end of the room a person whom he had not seen before a man had just entered so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges this man wore a violet knitted vest which was old worn spotted cut and gaping at every fold wide trousers of cotton velvet wooden shoes on his feet no shirt had his neck bare his bare arms tattooed and his face smeared with black he had seated himself in silence on the nearest bed and as he was behind jondrette he could only be indistinctly seen that sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze caused m leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as marius he could not refrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape jondrette ah i see exclaimed jondrette buttoning up his coat with an air of complaisance
1036,you are looking at your overcoat it fits me my faith but it fits me who is that man said m leblanc him ejaculated jondrette he's a neighbor of mine don't pay any attention to him the neighbor was a singular looking individual however manufactories of chemical products abound in the faubourg saint marceau many of the workmen might have black faces besides this m leblanc's whole person was expressive of candid and intrepid confidence he went on excuse me what were you saying m fabantou i was telling you sir and dear protector replied jondrette placing his elbows on the table and contemplating m leblanc with steady and tender eyes not unlike the eyes of the boa constrictor i was telling you that i have a picture to sell a slight sound came from the door a second man had just entered and seated himself on the bed behind jondrette like the first his arms were bare and he had a mask of ink or lampblack although this man had literally glided into the room he had not been able to prevent m leblanc catching sight of him don't mind them said jondrette they are people who belong in
1037,the house so i was saying that there remains in my possession a valuable picture but stop sir take a look at it he rose went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we have already mentioned and turned it round still leaving it supported against the wall it really was something which resembled a picture and which the candle illuminated somewhat marius could make nothing out of it as jondrette stood between the picture and him he only saw a coarse daub and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudity of foreign canvasses and screen paintings what is that asked m leblanc jondrette exclaimed a painting by a master a picture of great value my benefactor i am as much attached to it as i am to my two daughters it recalls souvenirs to me but i have told you and i will not take it back that i am so wretched that i will part with it either by chance or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness m leblanc's glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined the picture there were now four men
1038,three seated on the bed one standing near the door post all four with bare arms and motionless with faces smeared with black one of those on the bed was leaning against the wall with closed eyes and it might have been supposed that he was asleep he was old his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a horrible effect the other two seemed to be young one wore a beard the other wore his hair long none of them had on shoes those who did not wear socks were barefooted jondrette noticed that m leblanc's eye was fixed on these men they are friends they are neighbors said he their faces are black because they work in charcoal they are chimney builders don't trouble yourself about them my benefactor but buy my picture have pity on my misery i will not ask you much for it how much do you think it is worth well said m leblanc looking jondrette full in the eye and with the manner of a man who is on his guard it is some signboard for a tavern and is worth about three francs jondrette replied sweetly have you your pocket book
1039,with you i should be satisfied with a thousand crowns m leblanc sprang up placed his back against the wall and cast a rapid glance around the room he had jondrette on his left on the side next the window and the jondrette woman and the four men on his right on the side next the door the four men did not stir and did not even seem to be looking on jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone with so vague an eye and so lamentable an intonation that m leblanc might have supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery if you do not buy my picture my dear benefactor said jondrette i shall be left without resources there will be nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river when i think that i wanted to have my two girls taught the middle class paper box trade the making of boxes for new year's gifts well a table with a board at the end to keep the glasses from falling off is required then a special stove is needed a pot with three
1040,compartments for the different degrees of strength of the paste according as it is to be used for wood paper or stuff a paring knife to cut the cardboard a mould to adjust it a hammer to nail the steels pincers how the devil do i know what all and all that in order to earn four sous a day and you have to work fourteen hours a day and each box passes through the workwoman's hands thirteen times and you can't wet the paper and you mustn't spot anything and you must keep the paste hot the devil i tell you four sous a day how do you suppose a man is to live as he spoke jondrette did not look at m leblanc who was observing him m leblanc's eye was fixed on jondrette and jondrette's eye was fixed on the door marius eager attention was transferred from one to the other m leblanc seemed to be asking himself is this man an idiot jondrette repeated two or three distinct times with all manner of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order there is nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river i went
1041,down three steps at the side of the bridge of austerlitz the other day for that purpose all at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash the little man drew himself up and became terrible took a step toward m leblanc and cried in a voice of thunder that has nothing to do with the question do you know me xx the trap the door of the garret had just opened abruptly and allowed a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses and masked with masks of black paper the first was thin and had a long iron tipped cudgel the second who was a sort of colossus carried by the middle of the handle with the blade downward a butcher's pole axe for slaughtering cattle the third a man with thick set shoulders not so slender as the first held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison it appeared that the arrival of these men was what jondrette had been waiting for a rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel the thin one is everything ready said jondrette yes replied the thin man where
1042,is montparnasse the young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl which the eldest is there a carriage at the door yes is the team harnessed yes with two good horses excellent is it waiting where i ordered yes good said jondrette m leblanc was very pale he was scrutinizing everything around him in the den like a man who understands what he has fallen into and his head directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him moved on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness but there was nothing in his air which resembled fear he had improvised an intrenchment out of the table and the man who but an instant previously had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man had suddenly become a sort of athlete and placed his robust fist on the back of his chair with a formidable and surprising gesture this old man who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a danger seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageous as they are kind both easily and simply the father of a woman whom we love is never a stranger to
1043,us marius felt proud of that unknown man three of the men of whom jondrette had said they are chimney builders had armed themselves from the pile of old iron one with a heavy pair of shears the second with weighing tongs the third with a hammer and had placed themselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable the old man had remained on the bed and had merely opened his eyes the jondrette woman had seated herself beside him marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention would arrive and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling in the direction of the corridor in readiness to discharge his pistol jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel turned once more to m leblanc and repeated his question accompanying it with that low repressed and terrible laugh which was peculiar to him so you do not recognize me m leblanc looked him full in the face and replied no then jondrette advanced to the table he leaned across the candle crossing his arms putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to m leblanc's calm face and advancing as far as possible without
1044,forcing m leblanc to retreat and in this posture of a wild beast who is about to bite he exclaimed my name is not fabantou my name is not jondrette my name is thenardier i am the inn keeper of montfermeil do you understand thenardier now do you know me an almost imperceptible flush crossed m leblanc's brow and he replied with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level with his accustomed placidity no more than before marius did not hear this reply any one who had seen him at that moment through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard stupid thunder struck at the moment when jondrette said my name is thenardier marius had trembled in every limb and had leaned against the wall as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart then his right arm all ready to discharge the signal shot dropped slowly and at the moment when jondrette repeated thenardier do you understand marius's faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol fall jondrette by revealing his identity had not moved m leblanc but he had quite upset marius that name of thenardier with which
1045,m leblanc did not seem to be acquainted marius knew well let the reader recall what that name meant to him that name he had worn on his heart inscribed in his father's testament he bore it at the bottom of his mind in the depths of his memory in that sacred injunction a certain thenardier saved my life if my son encounters him he will do him all the good that lies in his power that name it will be remembered was one of the pieties of his soul he mingled it with the name of his father in his worship what this man was that thenardier that inn keeper of montfermeil whom he had so long and so vainly sought he had found him at last and how his father's saviour was a ruffian that man to whose service marius was burning to devote himself was a monster that liberator of colonel pontmercy was on the point of committing a crime whose scope marius did not as yet clearly comprehend but which resembled an assassination and against whom great god what a fatality what a bitter mockery of fate his father had commanded him from the depths of
1046,his coffin to do all the good in his power to this thenardier and for four years marius had cherished no other thought than to acquit this debt of his father's and at the moment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the very act of crime by justice destiny cried to him this is thenardier he could at last repay this man for his father's life saved amid a hail storm of grape shot on the heroic field of waterloo and repay it with the scaffold he had sworn to himself that if ever he found that thenardier he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet and now he actually had found him but it was only to deliver him over to the executioner his father said to him succor thenardier and he replied to that adored and sainted voice by crushing thenardier he was about to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who had torn him from death at the peril of his own life executed on the place saint jacques through the means of his son of that marius to whom he had
1047,entrusted that man by his will and what a mockery to have so long worn on his breast his father's last commands written in his own hand only to act in so horribly contrary a sense but on the other hand now look on that trap and not prevent it condemn the victim and to spare the assassin could one be held to any gratitude towards so miserable a wretch all the ideas which marius had cherished for the last four years were pierced through and through as it were by this unforeseen blow he shuddered everything depended on him unknown to themselves he held in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before his eyes if he fired his pistol m leblanc was saved and thenardier lost if he did not fire m leblanc would be sacrificed and who knows thenardier would escape should he dash down the one or allow the other to fall remorse awaited him in either case what was he to do what should he choose be false to the most imperious souvenirs to all those solemn vows to himself to the most sacred duty to the most venerated text should he
1048,ignore his father's testament or allow the perpetration of a crime on the one hand it seemed to him that he heard his ursule supplicating for her father and on the other the colonel commending thenardier to his care he felt that he was going mad his knees gave way beneath him and he had not even the time for deliberation so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyes was hastening to its catastrophe it was like a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master and which was now sweeping him away he was on the verge of swooning in the meantime thenardier whom we shall henceforth call by no other name was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy and wild triumph he seized the candle in his fist and set it on the chimney piece with so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished and the tallow bespattered the wall then he turned to m leblanc with a horrible look and spit out these words done for smoked brown cooked spitchcocked and again he began to march back and forth in full
1049,eruption ah he cried so i've found you again at last mister philanthropist mister threadbare millionnaire mister giver of dolls you old ninny ah so you don't recognize me no it wasn't you who came to montfermeil to my inn eight years ago on christmas eve it wasn't you who carried off that fantine's child from me the lark it wasn't you who had a yellow great coat no nor a package of duds in your hand as you had this morning here say wife it seems to be his mania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses old charity monger get out with you are you a hosier mister millionnaire you give away your stock in trade to the poor holy man what bosh merry andrew ah and you don't recognize me well i recognize you that i do i recognized you the very moment you poked your snout in here ah you'll find out presently that it isn't all roses to thrust yourself in that fashion into people's houses under the pretext that they are taverns in wretched clothes with the air of a poor man to whom one would give a sou to deceive persons to
1050,play the generous to take away their means of livelihood and to make threats in the woods and you can't call things quits because afterwards when people are ruined you bring a coat that is too large and two miserable hospital blankets you old blackguard you child stealer he paused and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment one would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole like the rhone then as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been saying to himself in a whisper he smote the table with his fist and shouted and with his goody goody air and apostrophizing m leblanc parbleu you made game of me in the past you are the cause of all my misfortunes for fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom i had and who certainly belonged to rich people and who had already brought in a great deal of money and from whom i might have extracted enough to live on all my life a girl who would have made up to me for everything that i lost in that vile cook shop where there was nothing but one continual row
1051,and where like a fool i ate up my last farthing oh i wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it well never mind say now you must have thought me ridiculous when you went off with the lark you had your cudgel in the forest you were the stronger revenge i'm the one to hold the trumps to day you're in a sorry case my good fellow oh but i can laugh really i laugh didn't he fall into the trap i told him that i was an actor that my name was fabantou that i had played comedy with mamselle mars with mamselle muche that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow the th of february and he didn't even notice that the th of january and not the th of february is the time when the quarter runs out absurd idiot and the four miserable philippes which he has brought me scoundrel he hadn't the heart even to go as high as a hundred francs and how he swallowed my platitudes that did amuse me i said to myself blockhead come i've got you i lick your paws
1052,this morning but i'll gnaw your heart this evening thenardier paused he was out of breath his little narrow chest panted like a forge bellows his eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a feeble cruel and cowardly creature which finds that it can at last harass what it has feared and insult what it has flattered the joy of a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of goliath the joy of a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick bull so nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself but sufficiently alive to suffer still m leblanc did not interrupt him but said to him when he paused i do not know what you mean to say you are mistaken in me i am a very poor man and anything but a millionnaire i do not know you you are mistaking me for some other person ah roared thenardier hoarsely a pretty lie you stick to that pleasantry do you you're floundering my old buck ah you don't remember you don't see who i am excuse me sir said m leblanc with a politeness of accent which at that moment
1053,seemed peculiarly strange and powerful i see that you are a villain who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a susceptibility of their own that monsters are ticklish at this word villain the female thenardier sprang from the bed thenardier grasped his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands don't you stir he shouted to his wife and turning to m leblanc villain yes i know that you call us that you rich gentlemen stop it's true that i became bankrupt that i am in hiding that i have no bread that i have not a single sou that i am a villain it's three days since i have had anything to eat so i'm a villain ah you folks warm your feet you have sakoski boots you have wadded great coats like archbishops you lodge on the first floor in houses that have porters you eat truffles you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch in the month of january and green peas you gorge yourselves and when you want to know whether it is cold you look in the papers to see what the engineer chevalier's thermometer says about it
1054,we it is we who are thermometers we don't need to go out and look on the quay at the corner of the tour de l'horologe to find out the number of degrees of cold we feel our blood congealing in our veins and the ice forming round our hearts and we say there is no god and you come to our caverns yes our caverns for the purpose of calling us villains but we'll devour you but we'll devour you poor little things just see here mister millionnaire i have been a solid man i have held a license i have been an elector i am a bourgeois that i am and it's quite possible that you are not here thenardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door and added with a shudder when i think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a cobbler then addressing m leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy and listen to this also mister philanthropist i'm not a suspicious character not a bit of it i'm not a man whose name nobody knows and who comes and abducts children from houses i'm an
1055,old french soldier i ought to have been decorated i was at waterloo so i was and in the battle i saved a general called the comte of i don't know what he told me his name but his beastly voice was so weak that i didn't hear all i caught was merci thanks i'd rather have had his name than his thanks that would have helped me to find him again the picture that you see here and which was painted by david at bruqueselles do you know what it represents it represents me david wished to immortalize that feat of prowess i have that general on my back and i am carrying him through the grape shot there's the history of it that general never did a single thing for me he was no better than the rest but none the less i saved his life at the risk of my own and i have the certificate of the fact in my pocket i am a soldier of waterloo by all the furies and now that i have had the goodness to tell you all this let's have an end of it i want money i want a
1056,deal of money i must have an enormous lot of money or i'll exterminate you by the thunder of the good god marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish and was listening the last possibility of doubt had just vanished it certainly was the thenardier of the will marius shuddered at that reproach of ingratitude directed against his father and which he was on the point of so fatally justifying his perplexity was redoubled moreover there was in all these words of thenardier in his accent in his gesture in his glance which darted flames at every word there was in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything in that mixture of braggadocio and abjectness of pride and pettiness of rage and folly in that chaos of real griefs and false sentiments in that immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delights of violence in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul in that conflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatreds something which was as hideous as evil and as heart rending as the truth the picture of the master the painting by david which he had proposed that m leblanc should purchase was
1057,nothing else as the reader has divined than the sign of his tavern painted as it will be remembered by himself the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at montfermeil as he had ceased to intercept marius visual ray marius could examine this thing and in the daub he actually did recognize a battle a background of smoke and a man carrying another man it was the group composed of pontmercy and thenardier the sergeant the rescuer the colonel rescued marius was like a drunken man this picture restored his father to life in some sort it was no longer the signboard of the wine shop at montfermeil it was a resurrection a tomb had yawned a phantom had risen there marius heard his heart beating in his temples he had the cannon of waterloo in his ears his bleeding father vaguely depicted on that sinister panel terrified him and it seemed to him that the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him when thenardier had recovered his breath he turned his bloodshot eyes on m leblanc and said to him in a low curt voice what have you to say before we put the handcuffs on
1058,you m leblanc held his peace in the midst of this silence a cracked voice launched this lugubrious sarcasm from the corridor if there's any wood to be split i'm there it was the man with the axe who was growing merry at the same moment an enormous bristling and clayey face made its appearance at the door with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth but fangs it was the face of the man with the butcher's axe why have you taken off your mask cried thenardier in a rage for fun retorted the man for the last few minutes m leblanc had appeared to be watching and following all the movements of thenardier who blinded and dazzled by his own rage was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidence that the door was guarded and of holding an unarmed man fast he being armed himself of being nine against one supposing that the female thenardier counted for but one man during his address to the man with the pole axe he had turned his back to m leblanc m leblanc seized this moment overturned the chair with his foot and the table with his fist
1059,and with one bound with prodigious agility before thenardier had time to turn round he had reached the window to open it to scale the frame to bestride it was the work of a second only he was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him back energetically into the hovel these were the three chimney builders who had flung themselves upon him at the same time the thenardier woman had wound her hands in his hair at the trampling which ensued the other ruffians rushed up from the corridor the old man on the bed who seemed under the influence of wine descended from the pallet and came reeling up with a stone breaker's hammer in his hand one of the chimney builders whose smirched face was lighted up by the candle and in whom marius recognized in spite of his daubing panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille lifted above m leblanc's head a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead at the two ends of a bar of iron marius could not resist this sight my father he thought forgive me and his finger sought the trigger of his pistol the shot was on
1060,the point of being discharged when thenardier's voice shouted don't harm him this desperate attempt of the victim far from exasperating thenardier had calmed him there existed in him two men the ferocious man and the adroit man up to that moment in the excess of his triumph in the presence of the prey which had been brought down and which did not stir the ferocious man had prevailed when the victim struggled and tried to resist the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand don't hurt him he repeated and without suspecting it his first success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged and to paralyze marius in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared and who in the face of this new phase saw no inconvenience in waiting a while longer who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him from the horrible alternative of allowing ursule's father to perish or of destroying the colonel's saviour a herculean struggle had begun with one blow full in the chest m leblanc had sent the old man tumbling rolling in the middle of the room then with two backward sweeps of
1061,his hand he had overthrown two more assailants and he held one under each of his knees the wretches were rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite millstone but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both arms and the back of his neck and were holding him doubled up over the two chimney builders on the floor thus the master of some and mastered by the rest crushing those beneath him and stifling under those on top of him endeavoring in vain to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him m leblanc disappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar beneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds they succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window and there they held him in awe the thenardier woman had not released her clutch on his hair don't you mix yourself up in this affair said thenardier you'll tear your shawl the thenardier obeyed as the female wolf obeys the male wolf with a growl now said thenardier search him you other fellows m leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance they searched him
1062,he had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six francs and his handkerchief thenardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket what no pocket book he demanded no nor watch replied one of the chimney builders never mind murmured the masked man who carried the big key in the voice of a ventriloquist he's a tough old fellow thenardier went to the corner near the door picked up a bundle of ropes and threw them at the men tie him to the leg of the bed said he and catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the room by the blow from m leblanc's fist and who made no movement he added is boulatruelle dead no replied bigrenaille he's drunk sweep him into a corner said thenardier two of the chimney builders pushed the drunken man into the corner near the heap of old iron with their feet babet said thenardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel why did you bring so many they were not needed what can you do replied the man with the cudgel they all wanted to be in it this is a bad season
1063,there's no business going on the pallet on which m leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital bed elevated on four coarse wooden legs roughly hewn m leblanc let them take their own course the ruffians bound him securely in an upright attitude with his feet on the ground at the head of the bed the end which was most remote from the window and nearest to the fireplace when the last knot had been tied thenardier took a chair and seated himself almost facing m leblanc thenardier no longer looked like himself in the course of a few moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunning sweetness marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a man in official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a moment before he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarming metamorphosis and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a tiger converted into a lawyer monsieur said thenardier and dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands on m leblanc stand off a little and let me have a talk with the gentleman
1064,all retired towards the door he went on monsieur you did wrong to try to jump out of the window you might have broken your leg now if you will permit me we will converse quietly in the first place i must communicate to you an observation which i have made which is that you have not uttered the faintest cry thenardier was right this detail was correct although it had escaped marius in his agitation m leblanc had barely pronounced a few words without raising his voice and even during his struggle with the six ruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular silence thenardier continued mon dieu you might have shouted stop thief a bit and i should not have thought it improper murder that too is said occasionally and so far as i am concerned i should not have taken it in bad part it is very natural that you should make a little row when you find yourself with persons who don't inspire you with sufficient confidence you might have done that and no one would have troubled you on that account you would not even have been gagged and i will
1065,tell you why this room is very private that's its only recommendation but it has that in its favor you might fire off a mortar and it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a drunken man here a cannon would make a boum and the thunder would make a pouf it's a handy lodging but in short you did not shout and it is better so i present you my compliments and i will tell you the conclusion that i draw from that fact my dear sir when a man shouts who comes the police and after the police justice well you have not made an outcry that is because you don't care to have the police and the courts come in any more than we do it is because i have long suspected it you have some interest in hiding something on our side we have the same interest so we can come to an understanding as he spoke thus it seemed as though thenardier who kept his eyes fixed on m leblanc were trying to plunge the sharp points which darted from the pupils into the very conscience of
1066,his prisoner moreover his language which was stamped with a sort of moderated subdued insolence and crafty insolence was reserved and almost choice and in that rascal who had been nothing but a robber a short time previously one now felt the man who had studied for the priesthood the silence preserved by the prisoner that precaution which had been carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life that resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature which is to utter a cry all this it must be confessed now that his attention had been called to it troubled marius and affected him with painful astonishment thenardier's well grounded observation still further obscured for marius the dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person on whom courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of monsieur leblanc but whoever he was bound with ropes surrounded with executioners half plunged so to speak in a grave which was closing in upon him to the extent of a degree with every moment that passed in the presence of thenardier's wrath as in the presence of his sweetness this man remained impassive and marius could not refrain from admiring at such
1067,a moment the superbly melancholy visage here evidently was a soul which was inaccessible to terror and which did not know the meaning of despair here was one of those men who command amazement in desperate circumstances extreme as was the crisis inevitable as was the catastrophe there was nothing here of the agony of the drowning man who opens his horror filled eyes under the water thenardier rose in an unpretending manner went to the fireplace shoved aside the screen which he leaned against the neighboring pallet and thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals in which the prisoner could plainly see the chisel white hot and spotted here and there with tiny scarlet stars then thenardier returned to his seat beside m leblanc i continue said he we can come to an understanding let us arrange this matter in an amicable way i was wrong to lose my temper just now i don't know what i was thinking of i went a great deal too far i said extravagant things for example because you are a millionnaire i told you that i exacted money a lot of money a deal of money that would not be reasonable
1068,mon dieu in spite of your riches you have expenses of your own who has not i don't want to ruin you i am not a greedy fellow after all i am not one of those people who because they have the advantage of the position profit by the fact to make themselves ridiculous why i'm taking things into consideration and making a sacrifice on my side i only want two hundred thousand francs m leblanc uttered not a word thenardier went on you see that i put not a little water in my wine i'm very moderate i don't know the state of your fortune but i do know that you don't stick at money and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give two hundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of luck certainly you are reasonable too you haven't imagined that i should take all the trouble i have to day and organized this affair this evening which has been labor well bestowed in the opinion of these gentlemen merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drink red wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at desnoyer's
1069,two hundred thousand francs it's surely worth all that this trifle once out of your pocket i guarantee you that that's the end of the matter and that you have no further demands to fear you will say to me but i haven't two hundred thousand francs about me oh i'm not extortionate i don't demand that i only ask one thing of you have the goodness to write what i am about to dictate to you here thenardier paused then he added emphasizing his words and casting a smile in the direction of the brazier i warn you that i shall not admit that you don't know how to write a grand inquisitor might have envied that smile thenardier pushed the table close to m leblanc and took an inkstand a pen and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open and in which gleamed the long blade of the knife he placed the sheet of paper before m leblanc write said he the prisoner spoke at last how do you expect me to write i am bound that's true excuse me ejaculated thenardier you are quite right and turning to bigrenaille untie the gentleman's
1070,right arm panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille executed thenardier's order when the prisoner's right arm was free thenardier dipped the pen in the ink and presented it to him understand thoroughly sir that you are in our power at our discretion that no human power can get you out of this and that we shall be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable extremities i know neither your name nor your address but i warn you that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying the letter which you are about to write shall have returned now be so good as to write what demanded the prisoner i will dictate m leblanc took the pen thenardier began to dictate my daughter the prisoner shuddered and raised his eyes to thenardier put down my dear daughter said thenardier m leblanc obeyed thenardier continued come instantly he paused you address her as thou do you not who asked m leblanc parbleu cried thenardier the little one the lark m leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion i do not know what you mean go on nevertheless ejaculated thenardier and he continued to dictate come immediately i am
1071,in absolute need of thee the person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me i am waiting for thee come with confidence m leblanc had written the whole of this thenardier resumed ah erase come with confidence that might lead her to suppose that everything was not as it should be and that distrust is possible m leblanc erased the three words now pursued thenardier sign it what's your name the prisoner laid down the pen and demanded for whom is this letter you know well retorted thenardier for the little one i just told you so it was evident that thenardier avoided naming the young girl in question he said the lark he said the little one but he did not pronounce her name the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from his accomplices to mention the name was to deliver the whole affair into their hands and to tell them more about it than there was any need of their knowing he went on sign what is your name urbain fabre said the prisoner thenardier with the movement of a cat dashed his hand into his pocket and drew
1072,out the handkerchief which had been seized on m leblanc he looked for the mark on it and held it close to the candle u f that's it urbain fabre well sign it u f the prisoner signed as two hands are required to fold the letter give it to me i will fold it that done thenardier resumed address it mademoiselle fabre at your house i know that you live a long distance from here near saint jacquesdu haut pas because you go to mass there every day but i don't know in what street i see that you understand your situation as you have not lied about your name you will not lie about your address write it yourself the prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment then he took the pen and wrote mademoiselle fabre at m urbain fabre's rue saint dominique d'enfer no thenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion wife he cried the thenardier woman hastened to him here's the letter you know what you have to do there is a carriage at the door set out at once and return ditto and addressing the man with the meat axe since you have
1073,taken off your nose screen accompany the mistress you will get up behind the fiacre you know where you left the team yes said the man and depositing his axe in a corner he followed madame thenardier as they set off thenardier thrust his head through the half open door and shouted into the corridor above all things don't lose the letter remember that you carry two hundred thousand francs with you the thenardier's hoarse voice replied be easy i have it in my bosom a minute had not elapsed when the sound of the cracking of a whip was heard which rapidly retreated and died away good growled thenardier they're going at a fine pace at such a gallop the bourgeoise will be back inside three quarters of an hour he drew a chair close to the fireplace folding his arms and presenting his muddy boots to the brazier my feet are cold said he only five ruffians now remained in the den with thenardier and the prisoner these men through the black masks or paste which covered their faces and made of them at fear's pleasure charcoal burners negroes or demons had a stupid and gloomy air and
1074,it could be felt that they perpetrated a crime like a bit of work tranquilly without either wrath or mercy with a sort of ennui they were crowded together in one corner like brutes and remained silent thenardier warmed his feet the prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity a sombre calm had succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few moments before the candle on which a large stranger had formed cast but a dim light in the immense hovel the brazier had grown dull and all those monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling no sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man who was fast asleep marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle the enigma was more impenetrable than ever who was this little one whom thenardier had called the lark was she his ursule the prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word the lark and had replied in the most natural manner in the world i do not know what you mean on the other hand the two letters u f were explained they meant urbain
1075,fabre and ursule was no longer named ursule this was what marius perceived most clearly of all a sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene there he stood almost incapable of movement or reflection as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters he waited in the hope of some incident no matter of what nature since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide in any case he said if she is the lark i shall see her for the thenardier woman is to bring her hither that will be the end and then i will give my life and my blood if necessary but i will deliver her nothing shall stop me nearly half an hour passed in this manner thenardier seemed to be absorbed in gloomy reflections the prisoner did not stir still marius fancied that at intervals and for the last few moments he had heard a faint dull noise in the direction of the prisoner all at once thenardier addressed the prisoner by the way monsieur fabre i might as well say
1076,it to you at once these few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation marius strained his ears my wife will be back shortly don't get impatient i think that the lark really is your daughter and it seems to me quite natural that you should keep her only listen to me a bit my wife will go and hunt her up with your letter i told my wife to dress herself in the way she did so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her they will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind somewhere outside the barrier there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses your young lady will be taken to it she will alight from the fiacre my comrade will enter the other vehicle with her and my wife will come back here to tell us it's done as for the young lady no harm will be done to her the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be quiet and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two hundred thousand francs she will be returned to you if you
1077,have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark that's all the prisoner uttered not a syllable after a pause thenardier continued it's very simple as you see there'll be no harm done unless you wish that there should be harm done i'm telling you how things stand i warn you so that you may be prepared he paused the prisoner did not break the silence and thenardier resumed as soon as my wife returns and says to me the lark is on the way we will release you and you will be free to go and sleep at home you see that our intentions are not evil terrible images passed through marius mind what that young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back one of those monsters was to bear her off into the darkness whither and what if it were she it was clear that it was she marius felt his heart stop beating what was he to do discharge the pistol place all those scoundrels in the hands of justice but the horrible man with the meat axe would none the less be out of reach with
1078,the young girl and marius reflected on thenardier's words of which he perceived the bloody significance if you have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark now it was not alone by the colonel's testament it was by his own love it was by the peril of the one he loved that he felt himself restrained this frightful situation which had already lasted above half an hour was changing its aspect every moment marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most heart breaking conjectures seeking hope and finding none the tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the den in the midst of this silence the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard to open and shut again the prisoner made a movement in his bonds here's the bourgeoise said thenardier he had hardly uttered the words when the thenardier woman did in fact rush hastily into the room red panting breathless with flaming eyes and cried as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously false address the ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and picked
1079,up his axe again she resumed nobody there rue saint dominique no no monsieur urbain fabre they know not what it means she paused choking then went on monsieur thenardier that old fellow has duped you you are too good you see if it had been me i'd have chopped the beast in four quarters to begin with and if he had acted ugly i'd have boiled him alive he would have been obliged to speak and say where the girl is and where he keeps his shiners that's the way i should have managed matters people are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider than women nobody at no it's nothing but a big carriage gate no monsieur fabre in the rue saint dominique and after all that racing and fee to the coachman and all i spoke to both the porter and the portress a fine stout woman and they know nothing about him marius breathed freely once more she ursule or the lark he no longer knew what to call her was safe while his exasperated wife vociferated thenardier had seated himself on the table for several minutes he uttered not a word
1080,but swung his right foot which hung down and stared at the brazier with an air of savage revery finally he said to the prisoner with a slow and singularly ferocious tone a false address what did you expect to gain by that to gain time cried the prisoner in a thundering voice and at the same instant he shook off his bonds they were cut the prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward he had bent down into the fireplace had stretched out his hand to the brazier and had then straightened himself up again and now thenardier the female thenardier and the ruffians huddled in amazement at the extremity of the hovel stared at him in stupefaction as almost free and in a formidable attitude he brandished above his head the red hot chisel which emitted a threatening glow the judicial examination to which the ambush in the gorbeau house eventually gave rise established the fact that a large sou piece cut and worked in a peculiar fashion was found in the garret when the police made their descent on it
1081,this sou piece was one of those marvels of industry which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in the shadows and for the shadows marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape these hideous and delicate products of wonderful art are to jewellers work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry there are benvenuto cellinis in the galleys just as there are villons in language the unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means sometimes without tools sometimes with a common wooden handled knife to saw a sou into two thin plates to hollow out these plates without affecting the coinage stamp and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere again this can be screwed together and unscrewed at will it is a box in this box he hides a watch spring and this watch spring properly handled cuts good sized chains and bars of iron the unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sou not at all he possesses liberty it was a large sou of this sort which during the subsequent search of the police was found under the bed near
1082,the window they also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou it is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at the moment when the ruffians searched him that he contrived to conceal it in his hand and that afterward having his right hand free he unscrewed it and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements which marius had observed as he had not been able to bend down for fear of betraying himself he had not cut the bonds of his left leg the ruffians had recovered from their first surprise be easy said bigrenaille to thenardier he still holds by one leg and he can't get away i'll answer for that i tied that paw for him in the meanwhile the prisoner had begun to speak you are wretches but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it when you think that you can make me speak that you can make me write what i do not choose to write that you can make me say what i do not choose to
1083,say he stripped up his left sleeve and added see here at the same moment he extended his arm and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh the crackling of the burning flesh became audible and the odor peculiar to chambers of torture filled the hovel marius reeled in utter horror the very ruffians shuddered hardly a muscle of the old man's face contracted and while the red hot iron sank into the smoking wound impassive and almost august he fixed on thenardier his beautiful glance in which there was no hatred and where suffering vanished in serene majesty with grand and lofty natures the revolts of the flesh and the senses when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth and make it appear on the brow just as rebellions among the soldiery force the captain to show himself wretches said he have no more fear of me than i have for you and tearing the chisel from the wound he hurled it through the window which had been left open the horrible glowing tool disappeared into the night whirling as it flew and fell
1084,far away on the snow the prisoner resumed do what you please with me he was disarmed seize him said thenardier two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder and the masked man with the ventriloquist's voice took up his station in front of him ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement at the same time marius heard below him at the base of the partition but so near that he could not see who was speaking this colloquy conducted in a low tone there is only one thing left to do cut his throat that's it it was the husband and wife taking counsel together thenardier walked slowly towards the table opened the drawer and took out the knife marius fretted with the handle of his pistol unprecedented perplexity for the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience the one enjoining him to respect his father's testament the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner these two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony up to that moment he had cherished a vague hope that he should find some means of reconciling these two duties but nothing within
1085,the limits of possibility had presented itself however the peril was urgent the last bounds of delay had been reached thenardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from the prisoner marius cast a wild glance about him the last mechanical resource of despair all at once a shudder ran through him at his feet on the table a bright ray of light from the full moon illuminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper on this paper he read the following line written that very morning in large letters by the eldest of the thenardier girls the bobbies are here an idea a flash crossed marius mind this was the expedient of which he was in search the solution of that frightful problem which was torturing him of sparing the assassin and saving the victim he knelt down on his commode stretched out his arm seized the sheet of paper softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall wrapped the paper round it and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of the den it was high time thenardier had conquered his last fears or his last scruples and was advancing on
1086,the prisoner something is falling cried the thenardier woman what is it asked her husband the woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster she handed it to her husband where did this come from demanded thenardier pardie ejaculated his wife where do you suppose it came from through the window of course i saw it pass said bigrenaille thenardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle it's in eponine's handwriting the devil he made a sign to his wife who hastily drew near and showed her the line written on the sheet of paper then he added in a subdued voice quick the ladder let's leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp without cutting that man's throat asked the thenardier woman we haven't the time through what resumed bigrenaille through the window replied thenardier since ponine has thrown the stone through the window it indicates that the house is not watched on that side the mask with the ventriloquist's voice deposited his huge key on the floor raised both arms in the air and opened and clenched his fists three times rapidly without uttering a word this was the signal like the
1087,signal for clearing the decks for action on board ship the ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him in the twinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window and solidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks the prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him he seemed to be dreaming or praying as soon as the ladder was arranged thenardier cried come the bourgeoise first and he rushed headlong to the window but just as he was about to throw his leg over bigrenaille seized him roughly by the collar not much come now you old dog after us after us yelled the ruffians you are children said thenardier we are losing time the police are on our heels well said the ruffians let's draw lots to see who shall go down first thenardier exclaimed are you mad are you crazy what a pack of boobies you want to waste time do you draw lots do you by a wet finger by a short straw with written names thrown into a hat would you like my hat cried a voice on the threshold all wheeled round it was javert
1088,he had his hat in his hand and was holding it out to them with a smile xxi one should always begin by arresting the victims at nightfall javert had posted his men and had gone into ambush himself between the trees of the rue de la barrieredes gobelins which faced the gorbeau house on the other side of the boulevard he had begun operations by opening his pockets and dropping into it the two young girls who were charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to the den but he had only caged azelma as for eponine she was not at her post she had disappeared and he had not been able to seize her then javert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal agreed upon the comings and goings of the fiacres had greatly agitated him at last he had grown impatient and sure that there was a nest there sure of being in luck having recognized many of the ruffians who had entered he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting for the pistol shot it will be remembered that he had marius pass key he had arrived
1089,just in the nick of time the terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they had abandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight in less than a second these seven men horrible to behold had grouped themselves in an attitude of defence one with his meat axe another with his key another with his bludgeon the rest with shears pincers and hammers thenardier had his knife in his fist the thenardier woman snatched up an enormous paving stone which lay in the angle of the window and served her daughters as an ottoman javert put on his hat again and advanced a couple of paces into the room with arms folded his cane under one arm his sword in its sheath halt there said he you shall not go out by the window you shall go through the door it's less unhealthy there are seven of you there are fifteen of us don't let's fall to collaring each other like men of auvergne bigrenaille drew out a pistol which he had kept concealed under his blouse and put it in thenardier's hand whispering in the latter's ear it's javert i don't dare fire at that man
1090,do you dare parbleu replied thenardier well then fire thenardier took the pistol and aimed at javert javert who was only three paces from him stared intently at him and contented himself with saying come now don't fire you'll miss fire thenardier pulled the trigger the pistol missed fire didn't i tell you so ejaculated javert bigrenaille flung his bludgeon at javert's feet you're the emperor of the fiends i surrender and you javert asked the rest of the ruffians they replied so do we javert began again calmly that's right that's good i said so you are nice fellows i only ask one thing said bigrenaille and that is that i may not be denied tobacco while i am in confinement granted said javert and turning round and calling behind him come in now a squad of policemen sword in hand and agents armed with bludgeons and cudgels rushed in at javert's summons they pinioned the ruffians this throng of men sparely lighted by the single candle filled the den with shadows handcuff them all shouted javert come on cried a voice which was not the voice of a man but of which no one would ever have said
1091,it is a woman's voice the thenardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the window and it was she who had just given vent to this roar the policemen and agents recoiled she had thrown off her shawl but retained her bonnet her husband who was crouching behind her was almost hidden under the discarded shawl and she was shielding him with her body as she elevated the paving stone above her head with the gesture of a giantess on the point of hurling a rock beware she shouted all crowded back towards the corridor a broad open space was cleared in the middle of the garret the thenardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed themselves to be pinioned and muttered in hoarse and guttural accents the cowards javert smiled and advanced across the open space which the thenardier was devouring with her eyes don't come near me she cried or i'll crush you what a grenadier ejaculated javert you've got a beard like a man mother but i have claws like a woman and he continued to advance the thenardier dishevelled and terrible set her feet far apart threw herself backwards
1092,and hurled the paving stone at javert's head javert ducked the stone passed over him struck the wall behind knocked off a huge piece of plastering and rebounding from angle to angle across the hovel now luckily almost empty rested at javert's feet at the same moment javert reached the thenardier couple one of his big hands descended on the woman's shoulder the other on the husband's head the handcuffs he shouted the policemen trooped in in force and in a few seconds javert's order had been executed the thenardier female overwhelmed stared at her pinioned hands and at those of her husband who had dropped to the floor and exclaimed weeping my daughters they are in the jug said javert in the meanwhile the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep behind the door and were shaking him he awoke stammering is it all over jondrette yes replied javert the six pinioned ruffians were standing and still preserved their spectral mien all three besmeared with black all three masked keep on your masks said javert and passing them in review with a glance of a frederick ii at a potsdam parade he said to the three chimney
1093,builders good day bigrenaille good day brujon good day deuxmilliards then turning to the three masked men he said to the man with the meat axe good day gueulemer and to the man with the cudgel good day babet and to the ventriloquist your health claquesous at that moment he caught sight of the ruffians prisoner who ever since the entrance of the police had not uttered a word and had held his head down untie the gentleman said javert and let no one go out that said he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table where the candle and the writing materials still remained drew a stamped paper from his pocket and began to prepare his report when he had written the first lines which are formulas that never vary he raised his eyes let the gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward the policemen glanced round them well said javert where is he the prisoner of the ruffians m leblanc m urbain fabre the father of ursule or the lark had disappeared the door was guarded but the window was not as soon as he had found himself released from his bonds and while javert was drawing
1094,up his report he had taken advantage of confusion the crowd the darkness and of a moment when the general attention was diverted from him to dash out of the window an agent sprang to the opening and looked out he saw no one outside the rope ladder was still shaking the devil ejaculated javert between his teeth he must have been the most valuable of the lot xxii the little one who was crying in two on the day following that on which these events took place in the house on the boulevard de l'hopital a child who seemed to be coming from the direction of the bridge of austerlitz was ascending the side alley on the right in the direction of the barriere de fontainebleau night had fully come this lad was pale thin clad in rags with linen trousers in the month of february and was singing at the top of his voice at the corner of the rue du petit banquier a bent old woman was rummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern the child jostled her as he passed then recoiled exclaiming hello and i took it for an
1095,enormous enormous dog he pronounced the word enormous the second time with a jeering swell of the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals an enormous enormous dog the old woman straightened herself up in a fury nasty brat she grumbled if i hadn't been bending over i know well where i would have planted my foot on you the boy was already far away kisss kisss he cried after that i don't think i was mistaken the old woman choking with indignation now rose completely upright and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face all hollowed into angles and wrinkles with crow's feet meeting the corners of her mouth her body was lost in the darkness and only her head was visible one would have pronounced her a mask of decrepitude carved out by a light from the night the boy surveyed her madame said he does not possess that style of beauty which pleases me he then pursued his road and resumed his song le roi coupdesabot s'en allait a la chasse a la chasse aux corbeaux at the end of these three lines he paused he had arrived in front
1096,of no and finding the door fastened he began to assault it with resounding and heroic kicks which betrayed rather the man's shoes that he was wearing than the child's feet which he owned in the meanwhile the very old woman whom he had encountered at the corner of the rue du petit banquier hastened up behind him uttering clamorous cries and indulging in lavish and exaggerated gestures what's this what's this lord god he's battering the door down he's knocking the house down the kicks continued the old woman strained her lungs is that the way buildings are treated nowadays all at once she paused she had recognized the gamin what so it's that imp why it's the old lady said the lad good day bougonmuche i have come to see my ancestors the old woman retorted with a composite grimace and a wonderful improvisation of hatred taking advantage of feebleness and ugliness which was unfortunately wasted in the dark there's no one here bah retorted the boy where's my father at la force come now and my mother at saint lazare well and my sisters at the madelonettes the lad scratched his head behind his ear stared at
1097,ma'am bougon and said ah then he executed a pirouette on his heel a moment later the old woman who had remained on the door step heard him singing in his clear young voice as he plunged under the black elm trees in the wintry wind le roi coupdesabot s'en allait a la chasse a la chasse aux corbeaux monte sur deux echasses quand on passait dessous on lui payait deux sous the end of iii marius iv saint denis the idyl in the rue plumet and the epic in the rue saint denis first a few pages of history i well cut and the two years which are immediately connected with the revolution of july form one of the most peculiar and striking moments of history these two years rise like two mountains midway between those which precede and those which follow them they have a revolutionary grandeur precipices are to be distinguished there the social masses the very assizes of civilization the solid group of superposed and adhering interests the century old profiles of the ancient french formation appear and disappear in them every instant athwart the storm clouds of systems of passions and of theories these appearances
1098,and disappearances have been designated as movement and resistance at intervals truth that daylight of the human soul can be descried shining there this remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to be sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal lines even at the present day we shall make the attempt the restoration had been one of those intermediate phases hard to define in which there is fatigue buzzing murmurs sleep tumult and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a halting place these epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to convert them to profit in the beginning the nation asks nothing but repose it thirsts for but one thing peace it has but one ambition to be small which is the translation of remaining tranquil of great events great hazards great adventures great men thank god we have seen enough we have them heaped higher than our heads we would exchange caesar for prusias and napoleon for the king of yvetot what a good little king was he we have marched since daybreak we have reached the evening of a long and toilsome day we have
1099,made our first change with mirabeau the second with robespierre the third with bonaparte we are worn out each one demands a bed devotion which is weary heroism which has grown old ambitions which are sated fortunes which are made seek demand implore solicit what a shelter they have it they take possession of peace of tranquillity of leisure behold they are content but at the same time certain facts arise compel recognition and knock at the door in their turn these facts are the products of revolutions and wars they are they exist they have the right to install themselves in society and they do install themselves therein and most of the time facts are the stewards of the household and fouriers who do nothing but prepare lodgings for principles this then is what appears to philosophical politicians at the same time that weary men demand repose accomplished facts demand guarantees guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men this is what england demanded of the stuarts after the protector this is what france demanded of the bourbons after the empire these guarantees are a necessity of the times they must be accorded princes grant them
1100,but in reality it is the force of things which gives them a profound truth and one useful to know which the stuarts did not suspect in and which the bourbons did not even obtain a glimpse of in the predestined family which returned to france when napoleon fell had the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed and that what it had bestowed it could take back again that the house of bourbon possessed the right divine that france possessed nothing and that the political right conceded in the charter of louis xviii was merely a branch of the right divine was detached by the house of bourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it should please the king to reassume it still the house of bourbon should have felt from the displeasure created by the gift that it did not come from it this house was churlish to the nineteenth century it put on an ill tempered look at every development of the nation to make use of a trivial word that is to say of a popular and a true word it looked glum the people saw this it thought
1101,it possessed strength because the empire had been carried away before it like a theatrical stage setting it did not perceive that it had itself been brought in in the same fashion it did not perceive that it also lay in that hand which had removed napoleon it thought that it had roots because it was the past it was mistaken it formed a part of the past but the whole past was france the roots of french society were not fixed in the bourbons but in the nations these obscure and lively roots constituted not the right of a family but the history of a people they were everywhere except under the throne the house of bourbon was to france the illustrious and bleeding knot in her history but was no longer the principal element of her destiny and the necessary base of her politics she could get along without the bourbons she had done without them for two and twenty years there had been a break of continuity they did not suspect the fact and how should they have suspected it they who fancied that louis xvii reigned on the th of thermidor and that louis xviii was
1102,reigning at the battle of marengo never since the origin of history had princes been so blind in the presence of facts and the portion of divine authority which facts contain and promulgate never had that pretension here below which is called the right of kings denied to such a point the right from on high a capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more on the guarantees granted in on the concessions as it termed them sad a sad thing what it termed its concessions were our conquests what it termed our encroachments were our rights when the hour seemed to it to have come the restoration supposing itself victorious over bonaparte and well rooted in the country that is to say believing itself to be strong and deep abruptly decided on its plan of action and risked its stroke one morning it drew itself up before the face of france and elevating its voice it contested the collective title and the individual right of the nation to sovereignty of the citizen to liberty in other words it denied to the nation that which made it a nation and to the citizen that which made
1103,him a citizen this is the foundation of those famous acts which are called the ordinances of july the restoration fell it fell justly but we admit it had not been absolutely hostile to all forms of progress great things had been accomplished with it alongside under the restoration the nation had grown accustomed to calm discussion which had been lacking under the republic and to grandeur in peace which had been wanting under the empire france free and strong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of europe the revolution had had the word under robespierre the cannon had had the word under bonaparte it was under louis xviii and charles x that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word the wind ceased the torch was lighted once more on the lofty heights the pure light of mind could be seen flickering a magnificent useful and charming spectacle for a space of fifteen years those great principles which are so old for the thinker so new for the statesman could be seen at work in perfect peace on the public square equality before the law liberty of conscience liberty of speech liberty of the
1104,press the accessibility of all aptitudes to all functions thus it proceeded until the bourbons were an instrument of civilization which broke in the hands of providence the fall of the bourbons was full of grandeur not on their side but on the side of the nation they quitted the throne with gravity but without authority their descent into the night was not one of those solemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history it was neither the spectral calm of charles i nor the eagle scream of napoleon they departed that is all they laid down the crown and retained no aureole they were worthy but they were not august they lacked in a certain measure the majesty of their misfortune charles x during the voyage from cherbourg causing a round table to be cut over into a square table appeared to be more anxious about imperilled etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy this diminution saddened devoted men who loved their persons and serious men who honored their race the populace was admirable the nation attacked one morning with weapons by a sort of royal insurrection felt itself in the possession of so much force that it did
1105,not go into a rage it defended itself restrained itself restored things to their places the government to law the bourbons to exile alas and then halted it took the old king charles x from beneath that dais which had sheltered louis xiv and set him gently on the ground it touched the royal personages only with sadness and precaution it was not one man it was not a few men it was france france entire france victorious and intoxicated with her victory who seemed to be coming to herself and who put into practice before the eyes of the whole world these grave words of guillaume du vair after the day of the barricades it is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of the great and to spring like a bird from bough to bough from an afflicted fortune to a flourishing one to show themselves harsh towards their prince in his adversity but as for me the fortune of my kings and especially of my afflicted kings will always be venerable to me the bourbons carried away with them respect but not regret as we have just stated their misfortune was greater than they
1106,were they faded out in the horizon the revolution of july instantly had friends and enemies throughout the entire world the first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm the others turned away each according to his nature at the first blush the princes of europe the owls of this dawn shut their eyes wounded and stupefied and only opened them to threaten a fright which can be comprehended a wrath which can be pardoned this strange revolution had hardly produced a shock it had not even paid to vanquished royalty the honor of treating it as an enemy and of shedding its blood in the eyes of despotic governments who are always interested in having liberty calumniate itself the revolution of july committed the fault of being formidable and of remaining gentle nothing however was attempted or plotted against it the most discontented the most irritated the most trembling saluted it whatever our egotism and our rancor may be a mysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the collaboration of some one who is working above man the revolution of july is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact a thing which is full of
1107,splendor right overthrowing the fact hence the brilliancy of the revolution of hence also its mildness right triumphant has no need of being violent right is the just and the true the property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure the fact even when most necessary to all appearances even when most thoroughly accepted by contemporaries if it exist only as a fact and if it contain only too little of right or none at all is infallibly destined to become in the course of time deformed impure perhaps even monstrous if one desires to learn at one blow to what degree of hideousness the fact can attain viewed at the distance of centuries let him look at machiavelli machiavelli is not an evil genius nor a demon nor a miserable and cowardly writer he is nothing but the fact and he is not only the italian fact he is the european fact the fact of the sixteenth century he seems hideous and so he is in the presence of the moral idea of the nineteenth this conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin of society to terminate this duel to amalgamate
1108,the pure idea with the humane reality to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the fact and the fact into right that is the task of sages ii badly sewed but the task of sages is one thing the task of clever men is another the revolution of came to a sudden halt as soon as a revolution has made the coast the skilful make haste to prepare the shipwreck the skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title of statesmen so that this word statesmen has ended by becoming somewhat of a slang word it must be borne in mind in fact that wherever there is nothing but skill there is necessarily pettiness to say the skilful amounts to saying the mediocre in the same way to say statesmen is sometimes equivalent to saying traitors if then we are to believe the skilful revolutions like the revolution of july are severed arteries a prompt ligature is indispensable the right too grandly proclaimed is shaken also right once firmly fixed the state must be strengthened liberty once assured attention must be directed to power here the sages are not as yet separated from the skilful but they begin
1109,to be distrustful power very good but in the first place what is power in the second whence comes it the skilful do not seem to hear the murmured objection and they continue their manoeuvres according to the politicians who are ingenious in putting the mask of necessity on profitable fictions the first requirement of a people after a revolution when this people forms part of a monarchical continent is to procure for itself a dynasty in this way say they peace that is to say time to dress our wounds and to repair the house can be had after a revolution the dynasty conceals the scaffolding and covers the ambulance now it is not always easy to procure a dynasty if it is absolutely necessary the first man of genius or even the first man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of a king you have in the first case napoleon in the second iturbide but the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a dynasty there is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity in a race and the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised if we place ourselves
1110,at the point of view of the statesmen after making all allowances of course after a revolution what are the qualities of the king which result from it he may be and it is useful for him to be a revolutionary that is to say a participant in his own person in that revolution that he should have lent a hand to it that he should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein that he should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it what are the qualities of a dynasty it should be national that is to say revolutionary at a distance not through acts committed but by reason of ideas accepted it should be composed of past and be historic be composed of future and be sympathetic all this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves with finding a man cromwell or napoleon and why the second absolutely insisted on finding a family the house of brunswick or the house of orleans royal houses resemble those indian fig trees each branch of which bending over to the earth takes root and becomes a fig tree itself each branch may become a dynasty on the sole condition
1111,that it shall bend down to the people such is the theory of the skilful here then lies the great art to make a little render to success the sound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may tremble from it also to season with fear every step that is taken to augment the curve of the transition to the point of retarding progress to dull that aurora to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm to cut all angles and nails to wad triumph to muffle up right to envelop the giant people in flannel and to put it to bed very speedily to impose a diet on that excess of health to put hercules on the treatment of a convalescent to dilute the event with the expedient to offer to spirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar thinned out with a potion to take one's precautions against too much success to garnish the revolution with a shade practised this theory already applied to england by is a revolution arrested midway half of progress quasi right now logic knows not the almost absolutely as the sun knows not the candle who arrests revolutions half way
1112,the bourgeoisie why because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction yesterday it was appetite to day it is plenitude to morrow it will be satiety the phenomenon of after napoleon was reproduced in after charles x the attempt has been made and wrongly to make a class of the bourgeoisie the bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the people the bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down a chair is not a caste but through a desire to sit down too soon one may arrest the very march of the human race this has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie one is not a class because one has committed a fault selfishness is not one of the divisions of the social order moreover we must be just to selfishness the state to which that part of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock of was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and laziness and which contains a little shame it was not the slumber which presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams it was the halt the halt is a word formed of a singular double
1113,and almost contradictory sense a troop on the march that is to say movement a stand that is to say repose the halt is the restoration of forces it is repose armed and on the alert it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds itself on its guard the halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of to morrow it is the partition between and what we here call combat may also be designated as progress the bourgeoisie then as well as the statesmen required a man who should express this word halt an although because a composite individuality signifying revolution and signifying stability in other terms strengthening the present by the evident compatibility of the past with the future this man was already found his name was louis philippe d'orleans the made louis philippe king lafayette undertook the coronation he called it the best of republics the town hall of paris took the place of the cathedral of rheims this substitution of a half throne for a whole throne was the work of when the skilful had finished the immense vice of their solution became apparent all this had been accomplished outside the bounds of

1118,at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization of order and organization an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery the founder and lawyer of a dynasty having something of charlemagne and something of an attorney in short a lofty and original figure a prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness of france and power in spite of the jealousy of europe louis philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his century and would be ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is useful louis philippe had been handsome and in his old age he remained graceful not always approved by the nation he always was so by the masses he pleased he had that gift of charming he lacked majesty he wore no crown although a king and no white hair although an old man his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new a mixture of
1119,the noble and the bourgeois which suited louis philippe was transition reigning he had preserved the ancient pronunciation and the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions modern he loved poland and hungary but he wrote les polonois and he pronounced les hongrais he wore the uniform of the national guard like charles x and the ribbon of the legion of honor like napoleon he went a little to chapel not at all to the chase never to the opera incorruptible by sacristans by whippers in by ballet dancers this made a part of his bourgeois popularity he had no heart he went out with his umbrella under his arm and this umbrella long formed a part of his aureole he was a bit of a mason a bit of a gardener something of a doctor he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his horse louis philippe no more went about without his lancet than did henri iv without his poniard the royalists jeered at this ridiculous king the first who had ever shed blood with the object of healing for the grievances against louis philippe there is one deduction to be made there is that
1120,which accuses royalty that which accuses the reign that which accuses the king three columns which all give different totals democratic right confiscated progress becomes a matter of secondary interest the protests of the street violently repressed military execution of insurrections the rising passed over by arms the rue transnonain the counsels of war the absorption of the real country by the legal country on half shares with three hundred thousand privileged persons these are the deeds of royalty belgium refused algeria too harshly conquered and as in the case of india by the english with more barbarism than civilization the breach of faith to abd el kader blaye deutz bought pritchard paid these are the doings of the reign the policy which was more domestic than national was the doing of the king as will be seen the proper deduction having been made the king's charge is decreased this is his great fault he was modest in the name of france whence arises this fault we will state it louis philippe was rather too much of a paternal king that incubation of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of everything and does not like
1121,to be disturbed hence excessive timidity which is displeasing to the people who have the th of july in their civil and austerlitz in their military tradition moreover if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled first of all that deep tenderness of louis philippe towards his family was deserved by the family that domestic group was worthy of admiration virtues there dwelt side by side with talents one of louis philippe's daughters marie d'orleans placed the name of her race among artists as charles d'orleans had placed it among poets she made of her soul a marble which she named jeanne d'arc two of louis philippe's daughters elicited from metternich this eulogium they are young people such as are rarely seen and princes such as are never seen this without any dissimulation and also without any exaggeration is the truth about louis philippe to be prince equality to bear in his own person the contradiction of the restoration and the revolution to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power therein lay the fortune of louis philippe in never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event
1122,the one entered into the other and the incarnation took place louis philippe is made man moreover he had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne exile he had been proscribed a wanderer poor he had lived by his own labor in switzerland this heir to the richest princely domains in france had sold an old horse in order to obtain bread at reichenau he gave lessons in mathematics while his sister adelaide did wool work and sewed these souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic he had with his own hands demolished the iron cage of mont saint michel built by louis xi and used by louis xv he was the companion of dumouriez he was the friend of lafayette he had belonged to the jacobins club mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder danton had said to him young man at the age of four and twenty in being then m de chartres he had witnessed from the depth of a box the trial of louis xvi so well named that poor tyrant the blind clairvoyance of the revolution breaking royalty in the king and the king with royalty did so almost without noticing
1123,the man in the fierce crushing of the idea the vast storm of the assembly tribunal the public wrath interrogating capet not knowing what to reply the alarming stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombre breath the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned he had looked on those things he had contemplated that giddiness he had seen the centuries appear before the bar of the assembly convention he had beheld behind louis xvi that unfortunate passer by who was made responsible the terrible culprit the monarchy rise through the shadows and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices of the populace which are almost as impersonal as the justice of god the trace left in him by the revolution was prodigious its memory was like a living imprint of those great years minute by minute one day in the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt he rectified from memory the whole of the letter a in the alphabetical list of the constituent assembly louis philippe was a king of the broad daylight while he reigned
1124,the press was free the tribune was free conscience and speech were free the laws of september are open to sight although fully aware of the gnawing power of light on privileges he left his throne exposed to the light history will do justice to him for this loyalty louis philippe like all historical men who have passed from the scene is to day put on his trial by the human conscience his case is as yet only in the lower court the hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent has not yet sounded for him the moment has not come to pronounce a definite judgment on this king the austere and illustrious historian louis blanc has himself recently softened his first verdict louis philippe was elected by those two almosts which are called the and that is to say by a half parliament and a half revolution and in any case from the superior point of view where philosophy must place itself we cannot judge him here as the reader has seen above except with certain reservations in the name of the absolute democratic principle in the eyes of the absolute outside these two rights the
1125,right of man in the first place the right of the people in the second all is usurpation but what we can say even at the present day that after making these reserves is that to sum up the whole and in whatever manner he is considered louis philippe taken in himself and from the point of view of human goodness will remain to use the antique language of ancient history one of the best princes who ever sat on a throne what is there against him that throne take away louis philippe the king there remains the man and the man is good he is good at times even to the point of being admirable often in the midst of his gravest souvenirs after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent he returned at night to his apartments and there exhausted with fatigue overwhelmed with sleep what did he do he took a death sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit considering it something to hold his own against europe but that it was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner he obstinately maintained his opinion against his
1126,keeper of the seals he disputed the ground with the guillotine foot by foot against the crown attorneys those chatterers of the law as he called them sometimes the pile of sentences covered his table he examined them all it was anguish to him to abandon these miserable condemned heads one day he said to the same witness to whom we have recently referred i won seven last night during the early years of his reign the death penalty was as good as abolished and the erection of a scaffold was a violence committed against the king the greve having disappeared with the elder branch a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under the name of the barriere saint jacques practical men felt the necessity of a quasi legitimate guillotine and this was one of the victories of casimir perier who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie over louis philippe who represented its liberal sides louis philippe annotated beccaria with his own hand after the fieschi machine he exclaimed what a pity that i was not wounded then i might have pardoned on another occasion alluding to the resistance offered by his ministry he wrote in connection with a
1127,political criminal who is one of the most generous figures of our day his pardon is granted it only remains for me to obtain it louis philippe was as gentle as louis ix and as kindly as henri iv now to our mind in history where kindness is the rarest of pearls the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great louis philippe having been severely judged by some harshly perhaps by others it is quite natural that a man himself a phantom at the present day who knew that king should come and testify in his favor before history this deposition whatever else it may be is evidently and above all things entirely disinterested an epitaph penned by a dead man is sincere one shade may console another shade the sharing of the same shadows confers the right to praise it it is not greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile this one flattered the other iv cracks beneath the foundation at the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of penetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds
1128,which envelop the beginning of louis philippe's reign it was necessary that there should be no equivoque and it became requisite that this book should offer some explanation with regard to this king louis philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority without violence without any direct action on his part by virtue of a revolutionary change evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the revolution but in which he the duc d'orleans exercised no personal initiative he had been born a prince and he believed himself to have been elected king he had not served this mandate on himself he had not taken it it had been offered to him and he had accepted it convinced wrongly to be sure but convinced nevertheless that the offer was in accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance with duty hence his possession was in good faith now we say it in good conscience louis philippe being in possession in perfect good faith and the democracy being in good faith in its attack the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the king nor on the democracy a clash of principles
1129,resembles a clash of elements the ocean defends the water the hurricane defends the air the king defends royalty the democracy defends the people the relative which is the monarchy resists the absolute which is the republic society bleeds in this conflict but that which constitutes its suffering to day will constitute its safety later on and in any case those who combat are not to be blamed one of the two parties is evidently mistaken the right is not like the colossus of rhodes on two shores at once with one foot on the republic and one in royalty it is indivisible and all on one side but those who are in error are so sincerely a blind man is no more a criminal than a vendean is a ruffian let us then impute to the fatality of things alone these formidable collisions whatever the nature of these tempests may be human irresponsibility is mingled with them let us complete this exposition the government of led a hard life immediately born yesterday it was obliged to fight to day hardly installed it was already everywhere conscious of vague movements of traction on the apparatus of july so recently laid
1130,and so lacking in solidity resistance was born on the morrow perhaps even it was born on the preceding evening from month to month the hostility increased and from being concealed it became patent the revolution of july which gained but little acceptance outside of france by kings had been diversely interpreted in france as we have said god delivers over to men his visible will in events an obscure text written in a mysterious tongue men immediately make translations of it translations hasty incorrect full of errors of gaps and of nonsense very few minds comprehend the divine language the most sagacious the calmest the most profound decipher slowly and when they arrive with their text the task has long been completed there are already twenty translations on the public place from each remaining springs a party and from each misinterpretation a faction and each party thinks that it alone has the true text and each faction thinks that it possesses the light power itself is often a faction there are in revolutions swimmers who go against the current they are the old parties for the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of god think that
1131,revolutions having sprung from the right to revolt one has the right to revolt against them error for in these revolutions the one who revolts is not the people it is the king revolution is precisely the contrary of revolt every revolution being a normal outcome contains within itself its legitimacy which false revolutionists sometimes dishonor but which remains even when soiled which survives even when stained with blood revolutions spring not from an accident but from necessity a revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real it is because it must be that it is none the less did the old legitimist parties assail the revolution of with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning errors make excellent projectiles they strike it cleverly in its vulnerable spot in default of a cuirass in its lack of logic they attacked this revolution in its royalty they shouted to it revolution why this king factions are blind men who aim correctly this cry was uttered equally by the republicans but coming from them this cry was logical what was blindness in the legitimists was clearness of vision in the democrats had bankrupted the people the enraged democracy reproached
1132,it with this between the attack of the past and the attack of the future the establishment of july struggled it represented the minute at loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries on the other hand with eternal right in addition and beside all this as it was no longer revolution and had become a monarchy was obliged to take precedence of all europe to keep the peace was an increase of complication a harmony established contrary to sense is often more onerous than a war from this secret conflict always muzzled but always growling was born armed peace that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness of the european cabinets is suspicious in itself the royalty of july reared up in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of european cabinets metternich would gladly have put it in kicking straps pushed on in france by progress it pushed on the monarchies those loiterers in europe after having been towed it undertook to tow meanwhile within her pauperism the proletariat salary education penal servitude prostitution the fate of the woman wealth misery production consumption division exchange coin credit the rights of capital the
1133,rights of labor all these questions were multiplied above society a terrible slope outside of political parties properly so called another movement became manifest philosophical fermentation replied to democratic fermentation the elect felt troubled as well as the masses in another manner but quite as much thinkers meditated while the soil that is to say the people traversed by revolutionary currents trembled under them with indescribably vague epileptic shocks these dreamers some isolated others united in families and almost in communion turned over social questions in a pacific but profound manner impassive miners who tranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano hardly disturbed by the dull commotion and the furnaces of which they caught glimpses this tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this agitated epoch these men left to political parties the question of rights they occupied themselves with the question of happiness the well being of man that was what they wanted to extract from society they raised material questions questions of agriculture of industry of commerce almost to the dignity of a religion in civilization such as it has formed itself a little by the command of god a great deal by the
1134,agency of man interests combine unite and amalgamate in a manner to form a veritable hard rock in accordance with a dynamic law patiently studied by economists those geologists of politics these men who grouped themselves under different appellations but who may all be designated by the generic title of socialists endeavored to pierce that rock and to cause it to spout forth the living waters of human felicity from the question of the scaffold to the question of war their works embraced everything to the rights of man as proclaimed by the french revolution they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child the reader will not be surprised if for various reasons we do not here treat in a thorough manner from the theoretical point of view the questions raised by socialism we confine ourselves to indicating them all the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves cosmogonic visions revery and mysticism being cast aside can be reduced to two principal problems first problem to produce wealth second problem to share it the first problem contains the question of work the second contains the question of salary in the first problem the employment of forces
1135,is in question in the second the distribution of enjoyment from the proper employment of forces results public power from a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness by a good distribution not an equal but an equitable distribution must be understood from these two things combined the public power without individual happiness within results social prosperity social prosperity means the man happy the citizen free the nation great england solves the first of these two problems she creates wealth admirably she divides it badly this solution which is complete on one side only leads her fatally to two extremes monstrous opulence monstrous wretchedness all enjoyments for some all privations for the rest that is to say for the people privilege exception monopoly feudalism born from toil itself a false and dangerous situation which sates public power or private misery which sets the roots of the state in the sufferings of the individual a badly constituted grandeur in which are combined all the material elements and into which no moral element enters communism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem they are mistaken their division kills production equal partition abolishes emulation and consequently labor it is a
1136,partition made by the butcher which kills that which it divides it is therefore impossible to pause over these pretended solutions slaying wealth is not the same thing as dividing it the two problems require to be solved together to be well solved the two problems must be combined and made but one solve only the first of the two problems you will be venice you will be england you will have like venice an artificial power or like england a material power you will be the wicked rich man you will die by an act of violence as venice died or by bankruptcy as england will fall and the world will allow to die and fall all that is merely selfishness all that does not represent for the human race either a virtue or an idea it is well understood here that by the words venice england we designate not the peoples but social structures the oligarchies superposed on nations and not the nations themselves the nations always have our respect and our sympathy venice as a people will live again england the aristocracy will fall but england the nation is immortal that said we continue solve the two
1137,problems encourage the wealthy and protect the poor suppress misery put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble by the strong put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy of the man who is making his way against the man who has reached the goal adjust mathematically and fraternally salary to labor mingle gratuitous and compulsory education with the growth of childhood and make of science the base of manliness develop minds while keeping arms busy be at one and the same time a powerful people and a family of happy men render property democratic not by abolishing it but by making it universal so that every citizen without exception may be a proprietor an easier matter than is generally supposed in two words learn how to produce wealth and how to distribute it and you will have at once moral and material greatness and you will be worthy to call yourself france this is what socialism said outside and above a few sects which have gone astray that is what it sought in facts that is what it sketched out in minds efforts worthy of admiration sacred attempts these doctrines these theories these resistances the unforeseen necessity
1138,for the statesman to take philosophers into account confused evidences of which we catch a glimpse a new system of politics to be created which shall be in accord with the old world without too much disaccord with the new revolutionary ideal a situation in which it became necessary to use lafayette to defend polignac the intuition of progress transparent beneath the revolt the chambers and streets the competitions to be brought into equilibrium around him his faith in the revolution perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the vague acceptance of a superior definitive right his desire to remain of his race his domestic spirit his sincere respect for the people his own honesty preoccupied louis philippe almost painfully and there were moments when strong and courageous as he was he was overwhelmed by the difficulties of being a king he felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation which was not nevertheless a reduction to dust france being more france than ever piles of shadows covered the horizon a strange shade gradually drawing nearer extended little by little over men over things over ideas a shade which came from wraths and systems everything which had been hastily stifled was
1139,moving and fermenting at times the conscience of the honest man resumed its breathing so great was the discomfort of that air in which sophisms were intermingled with truths spirits trembled in the social anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm the electric tension was such that at certain instants the first comer a stranger brought light then the twilight obscurity closed in again at intervals deep and dull mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed as to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud twenty months had barely elapsed since the revolution of july the year had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening the distress of the people the laborers without bread the last prince de conde engulfed in the shadows brussels expelling the nassaus as paris did the bourbons belgium offering herself to a french prince and giving herself to an english prince the russian hatred of nicolas behind us the demons of the south ferdinand in spain miguel in portugal the earth quaking in italy metternich extending his hand over bologna france treating austria sharply at ancona at the north no one knew what sinister sound of the hammer nailing up
1140,poland in her coffin irritated glances watching france narrowly all over europe england a suspected ally ready to give a push to that which was tottering and to hurl herself on that which should fall the peerage sheltering itself behind beccaria to refuse four heads to the law the fleurs de lys erased from the king's carriage the cross torn from notre dame lafayette lessened laffitte ruined benjamin constant dead in indigence casimir perier dead in the exhaustion of his power political and social malady breaking out simultaneously in the two capitals of the kingdom the one in the city of thought the other in the city of toil at paris civil war at lyons servile war in the two cities the same glare of the furnace a crater like crimson on the brow of the people the south rendered fanatic the west troubled the duchesse de berry in la vendee plots conspiracies risings cholera added the sombre roar of tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas v facts whence history springs and which history ignores towards the end of april everything had become aggravated the fermentation entered the boiling state ever since petty partial revolts had been
1141,going on here and there which were quickly suppressed but ever bursting forth afresh the sign of a vast underlying conflagration something terrible was in preparation glimpses could be caught of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted of a possible revolution france kept an eye on paris paris kept an eye on the faubourg saint antoine the faubourg saint antoine which was in a dull glow was beginning its ebullition the wine shops of the rue de charonne were although the union of the two epithets seems singular when applied to wine shops grave and stormy the government was there purely and simply called in question there people publicly discussed the question of fighting or of keeping quiet there were back shops where workingmen were made to swear that they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm and that they would fight without counting the number of the enemy this engagement once entered into a man seated in the corner of the wine shop assumed a sonorous tone and said you understand you have sworn sometimes they went up stairs to a private room on the first floor and there scenes that were almost masonic
1142,were enacted they made the initiated take oaths to render service to himself as well as to the fathers of families that was the formula in the tap rooms subversive pamphlets were read they treated the government with contempt says a secret report of that time words like the following could be heard there i don't know the names of the leaders we folks shall not know the day until two hours beforehand one workman said there are three hundred of us let each contribute ten sous that will make one hundred and fifty francs with which to procure powder and shot another said i don't ask for six months i don't ask for even two in less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government with twenty five thousand men we can face them another said i don't sleep at night because i make cartridges all night from time to time men of bourgeois appearance and in good coats came and caused embarrassment and with the air of command shook hands with the most important and then went away they never stayed more than ten minutes significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone the plot is
1143,ripe the matter is arranged it was murmured by all who were there to borrow the very expression of one of those who were present the exaltation was such that one day a workingman exclaimed before the whole wine shop we have no arms one of his comrades replied the soldiers have thus parodying without being aware of the fact bonaparte's proclamation to the army in italy when they had anything of a more secret nature on hand adds one report they did not communicate it to each other it is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they said these reunions were sometimes periodical at certain ones of them there were never more than eight or ten persons present and they were always the same in others any one entered who wished and the room was so full that they were forced to stand some went thither through enthusiasm and passion others because it was on their way to their work as during the revolution there were patriotic women in some of these wine shops who embraced new comers other expressive facts came to light a man would enter a shop drink and go his way
1144,with the remark wine merchant the revolution will pay what is due to you revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine shop facing the rue de charonne the balloting was carried on in their caps workingmen met at the house of a fencing master who gave lessons in the rue de cotte there there was a trophy of arms formed of wooden broadswords canes clubs and foils one day the buttons were removed from the foils a workman said there are twenty five of us but they don't count on me because i am looked upon as a machine later on that machine became quenisset the indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange and indescribable notoriety a woman sweeping off her doorsteps said to another woman for a long time there has been a strong force busy making cartridges in the open street proclamation could be seen addressed to the national guard in the departments one of these proclamations was signed burtot wine merchant one day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an italian accent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor seller in the marche lenoir and read aloud
1145,a singular document which seemed to emanate from an occult power groups formed around him and applauded the passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and noted down our doctrines are trammelled our proclamations torn our bill stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison the breakdown which has recently taken place in cottons has converted to us many mediums the future of nations is being worked out in our obscure ranks here are the fixed terms action or reaction revolution or counter revolution for at our epoch we no longer believe either in inertia or in immobility for the people against the people that is the question there is no other on the day when we cease to suit you break us but up to that day help us to march on all this in broad daylight other deeds more audacious still were suspicious in the eyes of the people by reason of their very audacity on the th of april a passer by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of the rue sainte marguerite and shouted i am a babouvist but beneath babeuf the people scented gisquet among other things this man
1146,said down with property the opposition of the left is cowardly and treacherous when it wants to be on the right side it preaches revolution it is democratic in order to escape being beaten and royalist so that it may not have to fight the republicans are beasts with feathers distrust the republicans citizens of the laboring classes silence citizen spy cried an artisan this shout put an end to the discourse mysterious incidents occurred at nightfall a workingman encountered near the canal a very well dressed man who said to him whither are you bound citizen sir replied the workingman i have not the honor of your acquaintance i know you very well however and the man added don't be alarmed i am an agent of the committee you are suspected of not being quite faithful you know that if you reveal anything there is an eye fixed on you then he shook hands with the workingman and went away saying we shall meet again soon the police who were on the alert collected singular dialogues not only in the wine shops but in the street get yourself received very soon said a weaver to a cabinet maker why
1147,there is going to be a shot to fire two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies fraught with evident jacquerie who governs us m philippe no it is the bourgeoisie the reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word jacquerie in a bad sense the jacques were the poor on another occasion two men were heard to say to each other as they passed by we have a good plan of attack only the following was caught of a private conversation between four men who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the barriere du trone everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about paris any more who was the he menacing obscurity the principal leaders as they said in the faubourg held themselves apart it was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine shop near the point saint eustache a certain aug chief of the society aid for tailors rue mondetour had the reputation of serving as intermediary central between the leaders and the faubourg saint antoine nevertheless there was always a great deal of mystery about these leaders and no certain fact can invalidate the singular arrogance of this
1148,reply made later on by a man accused before the court of peers who was your leader i knew of none and i recognized none there was nothing but words transparent but vague sometimes idle reports rumors hearsay other indications cropped up a carpenter occupied in nailing boards to a fence around the ground on which a house was in process of construction in the rue de reuilly found on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still legible the following lines the committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sections for the different societies and as a postscript we have learned that there are guns in the rue du faubourg poissonniere no bis to the number of five or six thousand in the house of a gunsmith in that court the section owns no arms what excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his neighbors was the fact that a few paces further on he picked up another paper torn like the first and still more significant of which we reproduce a facsimile because of the historical interest attaching to these strange documents q c d e learn this

1150,of the populaire the honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew its significance it appears that this list was the complete nomenclature of the sections of the fourth arondissement of the society of the rights of man with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections to day when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than history we may publish them it should be added that the foundation of the society of the rights of man seems to have been posterior to the date when this paper was found perhaps this was only a rough draft still according to all the remarks and the words according to written notes material facts begin to make their appearance in the rue popincourt in the house of a dealer in bric abrac there were seized seven sheets of gray paper all folded alike lengthwise and in four these sheets enclosed twenty six squares of this same gray paper folded in the form of a cartridge and a card on which was written the following saltpetre ounces sulphur ounces charcoal ounces and a half water ounces the report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong
1151,smell of powder a mason returning from his day's work left behind him a little package on a bench near the bridge of austerlitz this package was taken to the police station it was opened and in it were found two printed dialogues signed lahautiere a song entitled workmen band together and a tin box full of cartridges one artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see how warm he was the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat in a ditch on the boulevard between pere lachaise and the barriere du trone at the most deserted spot some children while playing discovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of wood a bag containing a bullet mould a wooden punch for the preparation of cartridges a wooden bowl in which there were grains of hunting powder and a little cast iron pot whose interior presented evident traces of melted lead police agents making their way suddenly and unexpectedly at five o'clock in the morning into the dwelling of a certain pardon who was afterwards a member of the barricade merry section and got himself killed in the insurrection of april found him standing
1152,near his bed and holding in his hand some cartridges which he was in the act of preparing towards the hour when workingmen repose two men were seen to meet between the barriere picpus and the barriere charenton in a little lane between two walls near a wine shop in front of which there was a jeu de siam one drew a pistol from beneath his blouse and handed it to the other as he was handing it to him he noticed that the perspiration of his chest had made the powder damp he primed the pistol and added more powder to what was already in the pan then the two men parted a certain gallais afterwards killed in the rue beaubourg in the affair of april boasted of having in his house seven hundred cartridges and twenty four flints the government one day received a warning that arms and two hundred thousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg on the following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed the remarkable point about it was that the police were not able to seize a single one an intercepted letter read the day is not far distant when within four
1153,hours by the clock eighty thousand patriots will be under arms all this fermentation was public one might almost say tranquil the approaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the face of the government no singularity was lacking to this still subterranean crisis which was already perceptible the bourgeois talked peaceably to the working classes of what was in preparation they said how is the rising coming along in the same tone in which they would have said how is your wife a furniture dealer of the rue moreau inquired well when are you going to make the attack another shop keeper said the attack will be made soon i know it a month ago there were fifteen thousand of you now there are twenty five thousand he offered his gun and a neighbor offered a small pistol which he was willing to sell for seven francs moreover the revolutionary fever was growing not a point in paris nor in france was exempt from it the artery was beating everywhere like those membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the human body the network of secret societies began to spread all over the country from the associations
1154,of the friends of the people which was at the same time public and secret sprang the society of the rights of man which also dated from one of the orders of the day pluviose year of the republican era which was destined to survive even the mandate of the court of assizes which pronounced its dissolution and which did not hesitate to bestow on its sections significant names like the following pikes tocsin signal cannon phrygian cap january the beggars the vagabonds forward march robespierre level ca ira the society of the rights of man engendered the society of action these were impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead other associations sought to recruit themselves from the great mother societies the members of sections complained that they were torn asunder thus the gallic society and the committee of organization of the municipalities thus the associations for the liberty of the press for individual liberty for the instruction of the people against indirect taxes then the society of equal workingmen which was divided into three fractions the levellers the communists the reformers then the army of the bastilles a sort of cohort organized on a military footing four men
1155,commanded by a corporal ten by a sergeant twenty by a sub lieutenant forty by a lieutenant there were never more than five men who knew each other creation where precaution is combined with audacity and which seemed stamped with the genius of venice the central committee which was at the head had two arms the society of action and the army of the bastilles a legitimist association the chevaliers of fidelity stirred about among these the republican affiliations it was denounced and repudiated there the parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities lyons nantes lille marseilles and each had its society of the rights of man the charbonniere and the free men all had a revolutionary society which was called the cougourde we have already mentioned this word in paris the faubourg saint marceau kept up an equal buzzing with the faubourg saint antoine and the schools were no less moved than the faubourgs a cafe in the rue saint hyacinthe and the wine shop of the seven billiards rue des mathurins saint jacques served as rallying points for the students the society of the friends of the a b c affiliated to the mutualists of angers and
1156,to the cougourde of aix met as we have seen in the cafe musain these same young men assembled also as we have stated already in a restaurant wine shop of the rue mondetour which was called corinthe these meetings were secret others were as public as possible and the reader can judge of their boldness from these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the ulterior prosecutions where was this meeting held in the rue de la paix at whose house in the street what sections were there only one which the manuel section who was its leader i you are too young to have decided alone upon the bold course of attacking the government where did your instructions come from from the central committee the army was mined at the same time as the population as was proved subsequently by the operations of beford luneville and epinard they counted on the fifty second regiment on the fifth on the eighth on the thirty seventh and on the twentieth light cavalry in burgundy and in the southern towns they planted the liberty tree that is to say a pole surmounted by a red cap such was the situation
1157,the faubourg saint antoine more than any other group of the population as we stated in the beginning accentuated this situation and made it felt that was the sore point this old faubourg peopled like an ant hill laborious courageous and angry as a hive of bees was quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult everything was in a state of agitation there without any interruption however of the regular work it is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yet sombre physiognomy in this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden under attic roofs there also exist rare and ardent minds it is particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it is dangerous to have extremes meet the faubourg saint antoine had also other causes to tremble for it received the counter shock of commercial crises of failures strikes slack seasons all inherent to great political disturbances in times of revolution misery is both cause and effect the blow which it deals rebounds upon it this population full of proud virtue capable to the highest degree of latent heat always ready to fly to arms prompt to explode irritated deep undermined seemed to be only
1158,awaiting the fall of a spark whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased by the wind of events it is impossible not to think of the faubourg saint antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very gates of paris that powder house of suffering and ideas the wine shops of the faubourg antoine which have been more than once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused possess historical notoriety in troublous times people grow intoxicated there more on words than on wine a sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus of the future circulates there swelling hearts and enlarging souls the cabarets of the faubourg saint antoine resemble those taverns of mont aventine erected on the cave of the sibyl and communicating with the profound and sacred breath taverns where the tables were almost tripods and where was drunk what ennius calls the sibylline wine the faubourg saint antoine is a reservoir of people revolutionary agitations create fissures there through which trickles the popular sovereignty this sovereignty may do evil it can be mistaken like any other but even when led astray it remains great we may say of it as of
1159,the blind cyclops ingens in according as the idea which was floating about was good or evil according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm there leaped forth from the faubourg saint antoine now savage legions now heroic bands savage let us explain this word when these bristling men who in the early days of the revolutionary chaos tattered howling wild with uplifted bludgeon pike on high hurled themselves upon ancient paris in an uproar what did they want they wanted an end to oppression an end to tyranny an end to the sword work for men instruction for the child social sweetness for the woman liberty equality fraternity bread for all the idea for all the edenizing of the world progress and that holy sweet and good thing progress they claimed in terrible wise driven to extremities as they were half naked club in fist a roar in their mouths they were savages yes but the savages of civilization they proclaimed right furiously they were desirous if only with fear and trembling to force the human race to paradise they seemed barbarians and they were saviours they demanded light with the mask of night facing these
1160,men who were ferocious we admit and terrifying but ferocious and terrifying for good ends there are other men smiling embroidered gilded beribboned starred in silk stockings in white plumes in yellow gloves in varnished shoes who with their elbows on a velvet table beside a marble chimney piece insist gently on demeanor and the preservation of the past of the middle ages of divine right of fanaticism of innocence of slavery of the death penalty of war glorifying in low tones and with politeness the sword the stake and the scaffold for our part if we were forced to make a choice between the barbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism we should choose the barbarians but thank heaven still another choice is possible no perpendicular fall is necessary in front any more than in the rear neither despotism nor terrorism we desire progress with a gentle slope god takes care of that god's whole policy consists in rendering slopes less steep vi enjolras and his lieutenants it was about this epoch that enjolras in view of a possible catastrophe instituted a kind of mysterious census all were present at a secret meeting at the cafe musain
1161,enjolras said mixing his words with a few half enigmatical but significant metaphors it is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we may count if combatants are required they must be provided it can do no harm to have something with which to strike passers by always have more chance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when there are none let us therefore reckon a little on the herd how many of us are there there is no question of postponing this task until to morrow revolutionists should always be hurried progress has no time to lose let us mistrust the unexpected let us not be caught unprepared we must go over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast this business ought to be concluded to day courfeyrac you will see the polytechnic students it is their day to go out to day is wednesday feuilly you will see those of the glaciere will you not combeferre has promised me to go to picpus there is a perfect swarm and an excellent one there bahorel will visit the estrapade prouvaire the masons are growing

1163,marius who is a good fellow on the whole but he no longer comes to us i need some one for the barriere du maine i have no one what about me said grantaire here am i you i you indoctrinate republicans you warm up hearts that have grown cold in the name of principle why not are you good for anything i have a vague ambition in that direction said grantaire you do not believe in everything i believe in you grantaire will you do me a service anything i'll black your boots well don't meddle with our affairs sleep yourself sober from your absinthe you are an ingrate enjolras you the man to go to the barriere du maine you capable of it i am capable of descending the rue de gres of crossing the place saint michel of sloping through the rue monsieur le prince of taking the rue de vaugirard of passing the carmelites of turning into the rue d'assas of reaching the rue du cherche midi of leaving behind me the conseil de guerre of pacing the rue des vielles tuileries of striding across the boulevard of following the chaussee du maine of passing the
1164,barrier and entering richefeu's i am capable of that my shoes are capable of that do you know anything of those comrades who meet at richefeu's not much we only address each other as thou what will you say to them i will speak to them of robespierre pardi of danton of principles you i but i don't receive justice when i set about it i am terrible i have read prudhomme i know the social contract i know my constitution of the year two by heart the liberty of one citizen ends where the liberty of another citizen begins do you take me for a brute i have an old bank bill of the republic in my drawer the rights of man the sovereignty of the people sapristi i am even a bit of a hebertist i can talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock watch in hand be serious said enjolras i am wild replied grantaire enjolras meditated for a few moments and made the gesture of a man who has taken a resolution grantaire he said gravely i consent to try you you shall go to the barriere du maine grantaire lived in
1165,furnished lodgings very near the cafe musain he went out and five minutes later he returned he had gone home to put on a robespierre waistcoat red said he as he entered and he looked intently at enjolras then with the palm of his energetic hand he laid the two scarlet points of the waistcoat across his breast and stepping up to enjolras he whispered in his ear be easy he jammed his hat on resolutely and departed a quarter of an hour later the back room of the cafe musain was deserted all the friends of the a b c were gone each in his own direction each to his own task enjolras who had reserved the cougourde of aix for himself was the last to leave those members of the cougourde of aix who were in paris then met on the plain of issy in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous in that side of paris as enjolras walked towards this place he passed the whole situation in review in his own mind the gravity of events was self evident when facts the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady move heavily the slightest complication stops
1166,and entangles them a phenomenon whence arises ruin and new births enjolras descried a luminous uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the future who knows perhaps the moment was at hand the people were again taking possession of right and what a fine spectacle the revolution was again majestically taking possession of france and saying to the world the sequel to morrow enjolras was content the furnace was being heated he had at that moment a powder train of friends scattered all over paris he composed in his own mind with combeferre's philosophical and penetrating eloquence feuilly's cosmopolitan enthusiasm courfeyrac's dash bahorel's smile jean prouvaire's melancholy joly's science bossuet's sarcasms a sort of electric spark which took fire nearly everywhere at once all hands to work surely the result would answer to the effort this was well this made him think of grantaire hold said he to himself the barriere du maine will not take me far out of my way what if i were to go on as far as richefeu's let us have a look at what grantaire is about and see how he is getting on one o'clock was striking from the vaugirard steeple when enjolras reached
1167,the richefeu smoking room he pushed open the door entered folded his arms letting the door fall to and strike his shoulders and gazed at that room filled with tables men and smoke a voice broke forth from the mist of smoke interrupted by another voice it was grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary grantaire was sitting opposite another figure at a marble saint anne table strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos he was hammering the table with his fist and this is what enjolras heard double six fours the pig i have no more you are dead a two six three one it's my move four points not much it's your turn i have made an enormous mistake you are doing well fifteen seven more that makes me twenty two thoughtfully twenty two you weren't expecting that double six if i had placed it at the beginning the whole play would have been changed a two again one one well five i haven't any it was your play i believe yes blank what luck he has ah you are lucky long revery two one neither five nor one that's bad for you domino plague take
1168,it second eponine i the lark's meadow marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose track he had set javert but javert had no sooner quitted the building bearing off his prisoners in three hackney coaches than marius also glided out of the house it was only nine o'clock in the evening marius betook himself to courfeyrac courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the latin quarter he had gone to live in the rue de la verrerie for political reasons this quarter was one where at that epoch insurrection liked to install itself marius said to courfeyrac i have come to sleep with you courfeyrac dragged a mattress off his bed which was furnished with two spread it out on the floor and said there at seven o'clock on the following morning marius returned to the hovel paid the quarter's rent which he owed to ma'am bougon had his books his bed his table his commode and his two chairs loaded on a hand cart and went off without leaving his address so that when javert returned in the course of the morning for the purpose of questioning marius as to the events of the
1169,preceding evening he found only ma'am bougon who answered moved away ma'am bougon was convinced that marius was to some extent an accomplice of the robbers who had been seized the night before who would ever have said it she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter a young man like that who had the air of a girl marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence the first was that he now had a horror of that house where he had beheld so close at hand and in its most repulsive and most ferocious development a social deformity which is perhaps even more terrible than the wicked rich man the wicked poor man the second was that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all probability and be brought in to testify against thenardier javert thought that the young man whose name he had forgotten was afraid and had fled or perhaps had not even returned home at the time of the ambush he made some efforts to find him however but without success a month passed then another marius was still with courfeyrac he had learned from a young licentiate
1170,in law an habitual frequenter of the courts that thenardier was in close confinement every monday marius had five francs handed in to the clerk's office of la force for thenardier as marius had no longer any money he borrowed the five francs from courfeyrac it was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed money these periodical five francs were a double riddle to courfeyrac who lent and to thenardier who received them to whom can they go thought courfeyrac whence can this come to me thenardier asked himself moreover marius was heart broken everything had plunged through a trap door once more he no longer saw anything before him his life was again buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly he had for a moment beheld very close at hand in that obscurity the young girl whom he loved the old man who seemed to be her father those unknown beings who were his only interest and his only hope in this world and at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them a gust had swept all these shadows away not a spark of certainty and truth had been
1171,emitted even in the most terrible of collisions no conjecture was possible he no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew it certainly was not ursule and the lark was a nickname and what was he to think of the old man was he actually in hiding from the police the white haired workman whom marius had encountered in the vicinity of the invalides recurred to his mind it now seemed probable that that workingman and m leblanc were one and the same person so he disguised himself that man had his heroic and his equivocal sides why had he not called for help why had he fled was he or was he not the father of the young girl was he in short the man whom thenardier thought that he recognized thenardier might have been mistaken these formed so many insoluble problems all this it is true detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the luxembourg heart rending distress marius bore a passion in his heart and night over his eyes he was thrust onward he was drawn and he could not stir all had vanished save love of love itself he
1172,had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations ordinarily this flame which burns us lights us also a little and casts some useful gleams without but marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion he never said to himself what if i were to go to such a place what if i were to try such and such a thing the girl whom he could no longer call ursule was evidently somewhere nothing warned marius in what direction he should seek her his whole life was now summed up in two words absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog to see her once again he still aspired to this but he no longer expected it to crown all his poverty had returned he felt that icy breath close to him on his heels in the midst of his torments and long before this he had discontinued his work and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work it is a habit which vanishes a habit which is easy to get rid of and difficult to take up again a certain amount of dreaming is good like a narcotic in discreet doses it lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind
1173,at labor which are sometimes severe and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects the over harsh contours of pure thought fills in gaps here and there binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas but too much dreaming sinks and drowns woe to the brain worker who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into revery he thinks that he can re ascend with equal ease and he tells himself that after all it is the same thing error thought is the toil of the intelligence revery its voluptuousness to replace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a food marius had begun in that way as the reader will remember passion had supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimaeras without object or bottom one no longer emerges from one's self except for the purpose of going off to dream idle production tumultuous and stagnant gulf and in proportion as labor diminishes needs increase this is a law man in a state of revery is generally prodigal and slack the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds there is in that mode of life good mingled
1174,with evil for if enervation is baleful generosity is good and healthful but the poor man who is generous and noble and who does not work is lost resources are exhausted needs crop up fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn and which ends in one of two holds suicide or crime by dint of going outdoors to think the day comes when one goes out to throw one's self in the water excess of revery breeds men like escousse and lebras marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace with his eyes fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw what we have just written seems strange and yet it is true the memory of an absent being kindles in the darkness of the heart the more it has disappeared the more it beams the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon the star of the inner night she that was marius whole thought he meditated of nothing else he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was becoming an impossible coat and that his new coat was growing old
1175,that his shirts were wearing out that his hat was wearing out that his boots were giving out and he said to himself if i could but see her once again before i die one sweet idea alone was left to him that she had loved him that her glance had told him so that she did not know his name but that she did know his soul and that wherever she was however mysterious the place she still loved him perhaps who knows whether she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her sometimes in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced by every heart that loves though he had no reasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy he said to himself it is her thoughts that are coming to me then he added perhaps my thoughts reach her also this illusion at which he shook his head a moment later was sufficient nevertheless to throw beams which at times resembled hope into his soul from time to time especially at that evening hour which is the most depressing to even the dreamy he allowed the purest the most impersonal
1176,the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else he called this writing to her it must not be supposed that his reason was deranged quite the contrary he had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly towards any fixed goal but he was endowed with more clear sightedness and rectitude than ever marius surveyed by a calm and real although peculiar light what passed before his eyes even the most indifferent deeds and men he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness his judgment which was almost wholly disassociated from hope held itself aloof and soared on high in this state of mind nothing escaped him nothing deceived him and every moment he was discovering the foundation of life of humanity and of destiny happy even in the midst of anguish is he to whom god has given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness he who has not viewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this double light has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true the soul which loves and
1177,suffers is in a state of sublimity however day followed day and nothing new presented itself it merely seemed to him that the sombre space which still remained to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant he thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss what he repeated to himself shall i not see her again before then when you have ascended the rue saint jacques left the barrier on one side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance you reach the rue de la sante then the glaciere and a little while before arriving at the little river of the gobelins you come to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of paris where ruysdeel would be tempted to sit down there is something indescribable there which exhales grace a green meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines from which flutter rags drying in the wind and an old market gardener's house built in the time of louis xiii with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer windows dilapidated palisades a little water amid poplar trees women voices laughter on
1178,the horizon the pantheon the pole of the deaf mutes the val de grace black squat fantastic amusing magnificent and in the background the severe square crests of the towers of notre dame as the place is worth looking at no one goes thither hardly one cart or wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour it chanced that marius solitary strolls led him to this plot of ground near the water that day there was a rarity on the boulevard a passer by marius vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the place asked this passer by what is the name of this spot the person replied it is the lark's meadow and he added it was here that ulbach killed the shepherdess of ivry but after the word lark marius heard nothing more these sudden congealments in the state of revery which a single word suffices to evoke do occur the entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else the lark was the appellation which had replaced ursule in the depths of marius melancholy stop said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor peculiar to these mysterious
1179,asides this is her meadow i shall know where she lives now it was absurd but irresistible and every day he returned to that meadow of the lark ii embryonic formation of crimes in the incubation of prisons javert's triumph in the gorbeau hovel seemed complete but had not been so in the first place and this constituted the principal anxiety javert had not taken the prisoner prisoner the assassinated man who flees is more suspicious than the assassin and it is probable that this personage who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians would be no less fine a prize for the authorities and then montparnasse had escaped javert another opportunity of laying hands on that devil's dandy must be waited for montparnasse had in fact encountered eponine as she stood on the watch under the trees of the boulevard and had led her off preferring to play nemorin with the daughter rather than schinderhannes with the father it was well that he did so he was free as for eponine javert had caused her to be seized a mediocre consolation eponine had joined azelma at les madelonettes and finally on the way from the gorbeau house
1180,to la force one of the principal prisoners claquesous had been lost it was not known how this had been effected the police agents and the sergeants could not understand it at all he had converted himself into vapor he had slipped through the handcuffs he had trickled through the crevices of the carriage the fiacre was cracked and he had fled all that they were able to say was that on arriving at the prison there was no claquesous either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it had claquesous melted into the shadows like a snow flake in water had there been unavowed connivance of the police agents did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder was he concentric with infraction and repression had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority javert did not accept such comminations and would have bristled up against such compromises but his squad included other inspectors besides himself who were more initiated than he perhaps although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the prefecture and claquesous had been such a villain that he might make a very good
1181,agent it is an excellent thing for ruffianism and an admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night these double edged rascals do exist however that may be claquesous had gone astray and was not found again javert appeared to be more irritated than amazed at this as for marius that booby of a lawyer who had probably become frightened and whose name javert had forgotten javert attached very little importance to him moreover a lawyer can be hunted up at any time but was he a lawyer after all the investigation had begun the magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men of the band of patron minette in close confinement in the hope that he would chatter this man was brujon the long haired man of the rue du petit banquier he had been let loose in the charlemagne courtyard and the eyes of the watchers were fixed on him this name of brujon is one of the souvenirs of la force in that hideous courtyard called the court of the batiment neuf new building which the administration called the court saint bernard and which the robbers
1182,called the fosseaux lions the lion's ditch on that wall covered with scales and leprosy which rose on the left to a level with the roofs near an old door of rusty iron which led to the ancient chapel of the ducal residence of la force then turned in a dormitory for ruffians there could still be seen twelve years ago a sort of fortress roughly carved in the stone with a nail and beneath it this signature brujon the brujon of was the father of the brujon of the latter of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the gorbeau house was a very cunning and very adroit young spark with a bewildered and plaintive air it was in consequence of this plaintive air that the magistrate had released him thinking him more useful in the charlemagne yard than in close confinement robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands of justice they do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as that to be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning on another crime they are artists who have one picture in the salon and who
1183,toil none the less on a new work in their studios brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison he could sometimes be seen standing by the hour together in front of the sutler's window in the charlemagne yard staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices which began with garlic centimes and ended with cigar centimes or he passed his time in trembling chattering his teeth saying that he had a fever and inquiring whether one of the eight and twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant all at once towards the end of february it was discovered that brujon that somnolent fellow had had three different commissions executed by the errand men of the establishment not under his own name but in the name of three of his comrades and they had cost him in all fifty sous an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of the prison corporal inquiries were instituted and on consulting the tariff of commissions posted in the convict's parlor it was learned that the fifty sous could be analyzed as follows three commissions one to the pantheon ten sous one to val de grace fifteen sous and one to the barriere
1184,de grenelle twenty five sous this last was the dearest of the whole tariff now at the pantheon at the val de grace and at the barriere de grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable prowlers of the barriers kruideniers alias bizarre glorieux an ex convict and barre carosse upon whom the attention of the police was directed by this incident it was thought that these men were members of patron minette two of those leaders babet and gueulemer had been captured it was supposed that the messages which had been addressed not to houses but to people who were waiting for them in the street must have contained information with regard to some crime that had been plotted they were in possession of other indications they laid hand on the three prowlers and supposed that they had circumvented some one or other of brujon's machinations about a week after these measures had been taken one night as the superintendent of the watch who had been inspecting the lower dormitory in the batiment neuf was about to drop his chestnut in the box this was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their duties
1185,punctually every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all the boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories a watchman looked through the peep hole of the dormitory and beheld brujon sitting on his bed and writing something by the light of the hall lamp the guardian entered brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month but they were not able to seize what he had written the police learned nothing further about it what is certain is that on the following morning a postilion was flung from the charlemagne yard into the lions ditch over the five story building which separated the two court yards what prisoners call a postilion is a pellet of bread artistically moulded which is sent into ireland that is to say over the roofs of a prison from one courtyard to another etymology over england from one land to another into ireland this little pellet falls in the yard the man who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note addressed to some prisoner in that yard if it is a prisoner who finds the treasure he forwards the note to its destination if it is a keeper
1186,or one of the prisoners secretly sold who are called sheep in prisons and foxes in the galleys the note is taken to the office and handed over to the police on this occasion the postilion reached its address although the person to whom it was addressed was at that moment in solitary confinement this person was no other than babet one of the four heads of patron minette the postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lines were written babet there is an affair in the rue plumet a gate on a garden this is what brujon had written the night before in spite of male and female searchers babet managed to pass the note on from la force to the salpetriere to a good friend whom he had and who was shut up there this woman in turn transmitted the note to another woman of her acquaintance a certain magnon who was strongly suspected by the police though not yet arrested this magnon whose name the reader has already seen had relations with the thenardier which will be described in detail later on and she could by going to see eponine serve as a
1187,bridge between the salpetriere and les madelonettes it happened that at precisely that moment as proofs were wanting in the investigation directed against thenardier in the matter of his daughters eponine and azelma were released when eponine came out magnon who was watching the gate of the madelonettes handed her brujon's note to babet charging her to look into the matter eponine went to the rue plumet recognized the gate and the garden observed the house spied lurked and a few days later brought to magnon who delivers in the rue clocheperce a biscuit which magnon transmitted to babet's mistress in the salpetriere a biscuit in the shady symbolism of prisons signifies nothing to be done so that in less than a week from that time as brujon and babet met in the circle of la force the one on his way to the examination the other on his way from it well asked brujon the rue p biscuit replied babet thus did the foetus of crime engendered by brujon in la force miscarry this miscarriage had its consequences however which were perfectly distinct from brujon's programme the reader will see what they were often when we think we are
1188,knotting one thread we are tying quite another iii apparition to father mabeuf marius no longer went to see any one but he sometimes encountered father mabeuf by chance while marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may be called the cellar stairs and which lead to places without light where the happy can be heard walking overhead m mabeuf was descending on his side the flora of cauteretz no longer sold at all the experiments on indigo had not been successful in the little garden of austerlitz which had a bad exposure m mabeuf could cultivate there only a few plants which love shade and dampness nevertheless he did not become discouraged he had obtained a corner in the jardin des plantes with a good exposure to make his trials with indigo at his own expense for this purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the flora he had reduced his breakfast to two eggs and he left one of these for his old servant to whom he had paid no wages for the last fifteen months and often his breakfast was his only meal he no longer smiled with his infantile smile he had grown morose and
1189,no longer received visitors marius did well not to dream of going thither sometimes at the hour when m mabeuf was on his way to the jardin des plantes the old man and the young man passed each other on the boulevard de l'hopital they did not speak and only exchanged a melancholy sign of the head a heart breaking thing it is that there comes a moment when misery looses bonds two men who have been friends become two chance passers by royal the bookseller was dead m mabeuf no longer knew his books his garden or his indigo these were the three forms which happiness pleasure and hope had assumed for him this sufficed him for his living he said to himself when i shall have made my balls of blueing i shall be rich i will withdraw my copperplates from the pawn shop i will put my flora in vogue again with trickery plenty of money and advertisements in the newspapers and i will buy i know well where a copy of pierre de medine's art de naviguer with wood cuts edition of in the meantime he toiled all day over his plot of indigo and at
1190,night he returned home to water his garden and to read his books at that epoch m mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age one evening he had a singular apparition he had returned home while it was still broad daylight mother plutarque whose health was declining was ill and in bed he had dined on a bone on which a little meat lingered and a bit of bread that he had found on the kitchen table and had seated himself on an overturned stone post which took the place of a bench in his garden near this bench there rose after the fashion in orchard gardens a sort of large chest of beams and planks much dilapidated a rabbit hutch on the ground floor a fruit closet on the first there was nothing in the hutch but there were a few apples in the fruit closet the remains of the winter's provision m mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading with the aid of his glasses two books of which he was passionately fond and in which a serious thing at his age he was interested his natural timidity rendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions
1191,in a certain degree the first of these books was the famous treatise of president delancre de l'inconstance des demons the other was a quarto by mutor de la rubaudiere sur les diables de vauvert et les gobelins de la bievre this last mentioned old volume interested him all the more because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in former times the twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and to blacken all below as he read over the top of the book which he held in his hand father mabeuf was surveying his plants and among others a magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations four days of heat wind and sun without a drop of rain had passed the stalks were bending the buds drooping the leaves falling all this needed water the rhododendron was particularly sad father mabeuf was one of those persons for whom plants have souls the old man had toiled all day over his indigo plot he was worn out with fatigue but he rose laid his books on the bench and walked all bent over and with tottering footsteps to the well but when he
1192,had grasped the chain he could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it then he turned round and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars the evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man beneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy the night promised to be as arid as the day had been stars everywhere thought the old man not the tiniest cloud not a drop of water and his head which had been upraised for a moment fell back upon his breast he raised it again and once more looked at the sky murmuring a tear of dew a little pity he tried again to unhook the chain of the well and could not at that moment he heard a voice saying father mabeuf would you like to have me water your garden for you at the same time a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible in the hedge and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall slender girl who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly at him she had less the air of a human being than of a
1193,form which had just blossomed forth from the twilight before father mabeuf who was easily terrified and who was as we have said quick to take alarm was able to reply by a single syllable this being whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness had unhooked the chain plunged in and withdrawn the bucket and filled the watering pot and the goodman beheld this apparition which had bare feet and a tattered petticoat running about among the flower beds distributing life around her the sound of the watering pot on the leaves filled father mabeuf's soul with ecstasy it seemed to him that the rhododendron was happy now the first bucketful emptied the girl drew a second then a third she watered the whole garden there was something about her as she thus ran about among paths where her outline appeared perfectly black waving her angular arms and with her fichu all in rags that resembled a bat when she had finished father mabeuf approached her with tears in his eyes and laid his hand on her brow god will bless you said he you are an angel since you take care of the flowers no
1194,she replied i am the devil but that's all the same to me the old man exclaimed without either waiting for or hearing her response what a pity that i am so unhappy and so poor and that i can do nothing for you you can do something said she what tell me where m marius lives the old man did not understand what monsieur marius he raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that had vanished a young man who used to come here in the meantime m mabeuf had searched his memory ah yes he exclaimed i know what you mean wait monsieur marius the baron marius pontmercy parbleu he lives or rather he no longer lives ah well i don't know as he spoke he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron and he continued hold i know now he very often passes along the boulevard and goes in the direction of the glaciere rue croulebarbe the meadow of the lark go there it is not hard to meet him when m mabeuf straightened himself up there was no longer any one there the girl had disappeared he was decidedly terrified really
1195,he thought if my garden had not been watered i should think that she was a spirit an hour later when he was in bed it came back to him and as he fell asleep at that confused moment when thought like that fabulous bird which changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea little by little assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber he said to himself in a bewildered way in sooth that greatly resembles what rubaudiere narrates of the goblins could it have been a goblin iv an apparition to marius some days after this visit of a spirit to farmer mabeuf one morning it was on a monday the day when marius borrowed the hundred sou piece from courfeyrac for thenardier marius had put this coin in his pocket and before carrying it to the clerk's office he had gone to take a little stroll in the hope that this would make him work on his return it was always thus however as soon as he rose he seated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in order to scribble some translation his task at that epoch
1196,consisted in turning into french a celebrated quarrel between germans the gans and savigny controversy he took savigny he took gans read four lines tried to write one could not saw a star between him and his paper and rose from his chair saying i shall go out that will put me in spirits and off he went to the lark's meadow there he beheld more than ever the star and less than ever savigny and gans he returned home tried to take up his work again and did not succeed there was no means of re knotting a single one of the threads which were broken in his brain then he said to himself i will not go out to morrow it prevents my working and he went out every day he lived in the lark's meadow more than in courfeyrac's lodgings that was his real address boulevard de la sante at the seventh tree from the rue croulebarbe that morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on the parapet of the river des gobelins a cheerful sunlight penetrated the freshly unfolded and luminous leaves he was dreaming of her and his meditation turning to
1197,a reproach fell back upon himself he reflected dolefully on his idleness his paralysis of soul which was gaining on him and of that night which was growing more dense every moment before him to such a point that he no longer even saw the sun nevertheless athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas which was not even a monologue so feeble had action become in him and he had no longer the force to care to despair athwart this melancholy absorption sensations from without did reach him he heard behind him beneath him on both banks of the river the laundresses of the gobelins beating their linen and above his head the birds chattering and singing in the elm trees on the one hand the sound of liberty the careless happiness of the leisure which has wings on the other the sound of toil what caused him to meditate deeply and almost reflect were two cheerful sounds all at once in the midst of his dejected ecstasy he heard a familiar voice saying come here he is he raised his eyes and recognized that wretched child who had come to him one morning the elder of the thenardier daughters
1198,eponine he knew her name now strange to say she had grown poorer and prettier two steps which it had not seemed within her power to take she had accomplished a double progress towards the light and towards distress she was barefooted and in rags as on the day when she had so resolutely entered his chamber only her rags were two months older now the holes were larger the tatters more sordid it was the same harsh voice the same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan the same free wild and vacillating glance she had besides more than formerly in her face that indescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in a prison adds to wretchedness she had bits of straw and hay in her hair not like ophelia through having gone mad from the contagion of hamlet's madness but because she had slept in the loft of some stable and in spite of it all she was beautiful what a star art thou o youth in the meantime she had halted in front of marius with a trace of joy in her livid countenance and something which resembled a smile she stood for several moments as though incapable
1199,of speech so i have met you at last she said at length father mabeuf was right it was on this boulevard how i have hunted for you if you only knew do you know i have been in the jug a fortnight they let me out seeing that there was nothing against me and that moreover i had not reached years of discretion i lack two months of it oh how i have hunted for you these six weeks so you don't live down there any more no said marius ah i understand because of that affair those take downs are disagreeable you cleared out come now why do you wear old hats like this a young man like you ought to have fine clothes do you know monsieur marius father mabeuf calls you baron marius i don't know what it isn't true that you are a baron barons are old fellows they go to the luxembourg in front of the chateau where there is the most sun and they read the quotidienne for a sou i once carried a letter to a baron of that sort he was over a hundred years old say where do you live
1200,now marius made no reply ah she went on you have a hole in your shirt i must sew it up for you she resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over you don't seem glad to see me marius held his peace she remained silent for a moment then exclaimed but if i choose nevertheless i could force you to look glad what demanded marius what do you mean ah you used to call me thou she retorted well then what dost thou mean she bit her lips she seemed to hesitate as though a prey to some sort of inward conflict at last she appeared to come to a decision so much the worse i don't care you have a melancholy air i want you to be pleased only promise me that you will smile i want to see you smile and hear you say ah well that's good poor mr marius you know you promised me that you would give me anything i like yes only speak she looked marius full in the eye and said i have the address marius turned pale all the blood flowed back to his heart what address the address that you
1201,asked me to get she added as though with an effort the address you know very well yes stammered marius of that young lady this word uttered she sighed deeply marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized her hand distractedly oh well lead me thither tell me ask of me anything you wish where is it come with me she responded i don't know the street or number very well it is in quite the other direction from here but i know the house well i will take you to it she withdrew her hand and went on in a tone which could have rent the heart of an observer but which did not even graze marius in his intoxicated and ecstatic state oh how glad you are a cloud swept across marius brow he seized eponine by the arm swear one thing to me swear said she what does that mean come you want me to swear and she laughed your father promise me eponine swear to me that you will not give this address to your father she turned to him with a stupefied air eponine how do you know that my
1202,name is eponine promise what i tell you but she did not seem to hear him that's nice you have called me eponine marius grasped both her arms at once but answer me in the name of heaven pay attention to what i am saying to you swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that you know my father said she ah yes my father be at ease he's in close confinement besides what do i care for my father but you do not promise me exclaimed marius let go of me she said bursting into a laugh how you do shake me yes yes i promise that i swear that to you what is that to me i will not tell my father the address there is that right is that it nor to any one said marius nor to any one now resumed marius take me there immediately immediately come along ah how pleased he is said she after a few steps she halted you are following me too closely monsieur marius let me go on ahead and follow me so without seeming to do it a nice young man like you must
1203,not be seen with a woman like me no tongue can express all that lay in that word woman thus pronounced by that child she proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more marius joined her she addressed him sideways and without turning towards him by the way you know that you promised me something marius fumbled in his pocket all that he owned in the world was the five francs intended for thenardier the father he took them and laid them in eponine's hand she opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground and gazed at him with a gloomy air i don't want your money said she third the house in the rue plumet i the house with a secret about the middle of the last century a chief justice in the parliament of paris having a mistress and concealing the fact for at that period the grand seignors displayed their mistresses and the bourgeois concealed them had a little house built in the faubourg saint germain in the deserted rue blomet which is now called rue plumet not far from the spot which was then designated as combat des animaux this house was
1204,composed of a single storied pavilion two rooms on the ground floor two chambers on the first floor a kitchen down stairs a boudoir up stairs an attic under the roof the whole preceded by a garden with a large gate opening on the street this garden was about an acre and a half in extent this was all that could be seen by passers by but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard and at the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and a cellar a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and nurse in case of need this building communicated in the rear by a masked door which opened by a secret spring with a long narrow paved winding corridor open to the sky hemmed in with two lofty walls which hidden with wonderful art and lost as it were between garden enclosures and cultivated land all of whose angles and detours it followed ended in another door also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league away almost in another quarter at the solitary extremity of the rue du babylone through this the chief justice entered
1205,so that even those who were spying on him and following him would merely have observed that the justice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere and would never have suspected that to go to the rue de babylone was to go to the rue blomet thanks to clever purchasers of land the magistrate had been able to make a secret sewer like passage on his own property and consequently without interference later on he had sold in little parcels for gardens and market gardens the lots of ground adjoining the corridor and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought they had a party wall before their eyes and did not even suspect the long paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower beds and their orchards only the birds beheld this curiosity it is probable that the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal about the chief justice the pavilion built of stone in the taste of mansard wainscoted and furnished in the watteau style rocaille on the inside old fashioned on the outside walled in with a triple hedge of flowers had something discreet coquettish and solemn about it
1206,as befits a caprice of love and magistracy this house and corridor which have now disappeared were in existence fifteen years ago in a coppersmith had purchased the house with the idea of demolishing it but had not been able to pay the price the nation made him bankrupt so that it was the house which demolished the coppersmith after that the house remained uninhabited and fell slowly to ruin as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does not communicate life it had remained fitted with its old furniture was always for sale or to let and the ten or a dozen people who passed through the rue plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since towards the end of the restoration these same passers by might have noticed that the bill had disappeared and even that the shutters on the first floor were open the house was occupied in fact the windows had short curtains a sign that there was a woman about in the month of october a man of a certain age had presented himself and had hired the house
1207,just as it stood including of course the back building and the lane which ended in the rue de babylone he had had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired the house as we have just mentioned was still very nearly furnished with the justice's old fitting the new tenant had ordered some repairs had added what was lacking here and there had replaced the paving stones in the yard bricks in the floors steps in the stairs missing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows and had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderly maid servant without commotion rather like a person who is slipping in than like a man who is entering his own house the neighbors did not gossip about him for the reason that there were no neighbors this unobtrusive tenant was jean valjean the young girl was cosette the servant was a woman named toussaint whom jean valjean had saved from the hospital and from wretchedness and who was elderly a stammerer and from the provinces three qualities which had decided jean valjean to take her with him he had hired the
1208,house under the name of m fauchelevent independent gentleman in all that has been related heretofore the reader has doubtless been no less prompt than thenardier to recognize jean valjean why had jean valjean quitted the convent of the petit picpus what had happened nothing had happened it will be remembered that jean valjean was happy in the convent so happy that his conscience finally took the alarm he saw cosette every day he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more he brooded over the soul of that child he said to himself that she was his that nothing could take her from him that this would last indefinitely that she would certainly become a nun being thereto gently incited every day that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as it was for him that he should grow old there and that she would grow up there that she would grow old there and that he should die there that in short delightful hope no separation was possible on reflecting upon this he fell into perplexity he interrogated himself he asked himself if all that happiness were really his if it were not
1209,composed of the happiness of another of the happiness of that child which he an old man was confiscating and stealing if that were not theft he said to himself that this child had a right to know life before renouncing it that to deprive her in advance and in some sort without consulting her of all joys under the pretext of saving her from all trials to take advantage of her ignorance of her isolation in order to make an artificial vocation germinate in her was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie to god and who knows if when she came to be aware of all this some day and found herself a nun to her sorrow cosette would not come to hate him a last almost selfish thought and less heroic than the rest but which was intolerable to him he resolved to quit the convent he resolved on this he recognized with anguish the fact that it was necessary as for objections there were none five years sojourn between these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed or dispersed the elements of fear he could return tranquilly among men he had
1210,grown old and all had undergone a change who would recognize him now and then to face the worst there was danger only for himself and he had no right to condemn cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys besides what is danger in comparison with the right finally nothing prevented his being prudent and taking his precautions as for cosette's education it was almost finished and complete his determination once taken he awaited an opportunity it was not long in presenting itself old fauchelevent died jean valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told her that having come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother which permitted him henceforth to live without working he should leave the service of the convent and take his daughter with him but that as it was not just that cosette since she had not taken the vows should have received her education gratuitously he humbly begged the reverend prioress to see fit that he should offer to the community as indemnity for the five years which cosette had spent there the sum of five thousand francs it was thus that
1211,jean valjean quitted the convent of the perpetual adoration on leaving the convent he took in his own arms the little valise the key to which he still wore on his person and would permit no porter to touch it this puzzled cosette because of the odor of embalming which proceeded from it let us state at once that this trunk never quitted him more he always had it in his chamber it was the first and only thing sometimes that he carried off in his moving when he moved about cosette laughed at it and called this valise his inseparable saying i am jealous of it nevertheless jean valjean did not reappear in the open air without profound anxiety he discovered the house in the rue plumet and hid himself from sight there henceforth he was in the possession of the name ultime fauchelevent at the same time he hired two other apartments in paris in order that he might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the same quarter and so that he could at need take himself off at the slightest disquietude which should assail him and in short so that he might
1212,not again be caught unprovided as on the night when he had so miraculously escaped from javert these two apartments were very pitiable poor in appearance and in two quarters which were far remote from each other the one in the rue de l'ouest the other in the rue de l'homme arme he went from time to time now to the rue de l'homme arme now to the rue de l'ouest to pass a month or six weeks without taking toussaint he had himself served by the porters and gave himself out as a gentleman from the suburbs living on his funds and having a little temporary resting place in town this lofty virtue had three domiciles in paris for the sake of escaping from the police ii jean valjean as a national guard however properly speaking he lived in the rue plumet and he had arranged his existence there in the following fashion cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion she had the big sleeping room with the painted pier glasses the boudoir with the gilded fillets the justice's drawing room furnished with tapestries and vast arm chairs she had the garden jean valjean had a canopied bed of
1213,antique damask in three colors and a beautiful persian rug purchased in the rue du figuier saint paul at mother gaucher's put into cosette's chamber and in order to redeem the severity of these magnificent old things he had amalgamated with this bric a brac all the gay and graceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young girls an etagere a bookcase filled with gilt edged books an inkstand a blotting book paper a work table incrusted with mother of pearl a silver gilt dressing case a toilet service in japanese porcelain long damask curtains with a red foundation and three colors like those on the bed hung at the windows of the first floor on the ground floor the curtains were of tapestry all winter long cosette's little house was heated from top to bottom jean valjean inhabited the sort of porter's lodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard with a mattress on a folding bed a white wood table two straw chairs an earthenware water jug a few old volumes on a shelf his beloved valise in one corner and never any fire he dined with cosette and he had a loaf of black
1214,bread on the table for his own use when toussaint came he had said to her it is the young lady who is the mistress of this house and you monsieur toussaint replied in amazement i am a much better thing than the master i am the father cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent and she regulated their expenditure which was very modest every day jean valjean put his arm through cosette's and took her for a walk he led her to the luxembourg to the least frequented walk and every sunday he took her to mass at saint jacques du haut pas because that was a long way off as it was a very poor quarter he bestowed alms largely there and the poor people surrounded him in church which had drawn down upon him thenardier's epistle to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacques du haut pas he was fond of taking cosette to visit the poor and the sick no stranger ever entered the house in the rue plumet toussaint brought their provisions and jean valjean went himself for water to a fountain near by on the boulevard their wood and wine were
1215,put into a half subterranean hollow lined with rock work which lay near the rue de babylone and which had formerly served the chief justice as a grotto for at the epoch of follies and little houses no love was without a grotto in the door opening on the rue de babylone there was a box destined for the reception of letters and papers only as the three inhabitants of the pavilion in the rue plumet received neither papers nor letters the entire usefulness of that box formerly the go between of a love affair and the confidant of a love lorn lawyer was now limited to the tax collector's notices and the summons of the guard for m fauchelevent independent gentleman belonged to the national guard he had not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of the municipal information collected at that time had even reached the convent of the petit picpus a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud whence jean valjean had emerged in venerable guise and consequently worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall three or four times a year jean valjean donned his uniform and mounted guard he
1216,did this willingly however it was a correct disguise which mixed him with every one and yet left him solitary jean valjean had just attained his sixtieth birthday the age of legal exemption but he did not appear to be over fifty moreover he had no desire to escape his sergeant major nor to quibble with comte de lobau he possessed no civil status he was concealing his name he was concealing his identity so he concealed his age he concealed everything and as we have just said he willingly did his duty as a national guard the sum of his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his taxes this man had for his ideal within the angel without the bourgeois let us note one detail however when jean valjean went out with cosette he dressed as the reader has already seen and had the air of a retired officer when he went out alone which was generally at night he was always dressed in a workingman's trousers and blouse and wore a cap which concealed his face was this precaution or humility both cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny and hardly noticed
1217,her father's peculiarities as for toussaint she venerated jean valjean and thought everything he did right one day her butcher who had caught a glimpse of jean valjean said to her that's a queer fish she replied he's a saint neither jean valjean nor cosette nor toussaint ever entered or emerged except by the door on the rue de babylone unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the rue plumet that gate was always closed jean valjean had left the garden uncultivated in order not to attract attention in this possibly he made a mistake iii foliis ac frondibus the garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become extraordinary and charming the passers by of forty years ago halted to gaze at it without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant depths more than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of that ancient padlocked gate twisted tottering fastened to two green and moss covered pillars and oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherable arabesque there was a
1218,stone bench in one corner one or two mouldy statues several lattices which had lost their nails with time were rotting on the wall and there were no walks nor turf but there was enough grass everywhere gardening had taken its departure and nature had returned weeds abounded which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land the festival of gilliflowers was something splendid nothing in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life venerable growth reigned there among them the trees had bent over towards the nettles the plant had sprung upward the branch had inclined that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that which expands in the air that which floats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails in the moss trunks boughs leaves fibres clusters tendrils shoots spines thorns had mingled crossed married confounded themselves in each other vegetation in a deep and close embrace had celebrated and accomplished there under the well pleased eye of the creator in that enclosure three hundred feet square the holy mystery of fraternity symbol of the human fraternity this garden was no longer a garden it was
1219,a colossal thicket that is to say something as impenetrable as a forest as peopled as a city quivering like a nest sombre like a cathedral fragrant like a bouquet solitary as a tomb living as a throng in floreal this enormous thicket free behind its gate and within its four walls entered upon the secret labor of germination quivered in the rising sun almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love and which feels the sap of april rising and boiling in its veins and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks sprinkled on the damp earth on the defaced statues on the crumbling steps of the pavilion and even on the pavement of the deserted street flowers like stars dew like pearls fecundity beauty life joy perfumes at midday a thousand white butterflies took refuge there and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about there in flakes amid the shade there in those gay shadows of verdure a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul and what the twittering forgot to say the humming completed in the evening a dreamy vapor exhaled from the
1220,garden and enveloped it a shroud of mist a calm and celestial sadness covered it the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it like an exquisite and subtle poison the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees by day the wings rejoice the leaves by night the leaves protect the wings in winter the thicket was black dripping bristling shivering and allowed some glimpse of the house instead of flowers on the branches and dew in the flowers the long silvery tracks of the snails were visible on the cold thick carpet of yellow leaves but in any fashion under any aspect at all seasons spring winter summer autumn this tiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy contemplation solitude liberty the absence of man the presence of god and the rusty old gate had the air of saying this garden belongs to me it was of no avail that the pavements of paris were there on every side the classic and splendid hotels of the rue de varennes a couple of paces away the dome

1225,coquettish garden formerly decidedly compromised had returned to virginity and modesty a justice assisted by a gardener a goodman who thought that he was a continuation of lamoignon and another goodman who thought that he was a continuation of lenotre had turned it about cut ruffled decked moulded it to gallantry nature had taken possession of it once more had filled it with shade and had arranged it for love there was also in this solitude a heart which was quite ready love had only to show himself he had here a temple composed of verdure grass moss the sight of birds tender shadows agitated branches and a soul made of sweetness of faith of candor of hope of aspiration and of illusion cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child she was a little more than fourteen and she was at the ungrateful age we have already said that with the exception of her eyes she was homely rather than pretty she had no ungraceful feature but she was awkward thin timid and bold at once a grown up little girl in short her education was finished that is to say she has been taught
1226,religion and even and above all devotion then history that is to say the thing that bears that name in convents geography grammar the participles the kings of france a little music a little drawing etc but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant which is a great charm and a great peril the soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark later on mirages that are too abrupt and too lively are formed there as in a dark chamber she should be gently and discreetly enlightened rather with the reflection of realities than with their harsh and direct light a useful and graciously austere half light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls there is nothing but the maternal instinct that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman which knows how this half light is to be created and of what it should consist nothing supplies the place of this instinct all the nuns in the world are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl's soul cosette had had no mother she had only had many mothers in the
1227,plural as for jean valjean he was indeed all tenderness all solicitude but he was only an old man and he knew nothing at all now in this work of education in this grave matter of preparing a woman for life what science is required to combat that vast ignorance which is called innocence nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent the convent turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown the heart thus thrown back upon itself works downward within itself since it cannot overflow and grows deep since it cannot expand hence visions suppositions conjectures outlines of romances a desire for adventures fantastic constructions edifices built wholly in the inner obscurity of the mind sombre and secret abodes where the passions immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to enter the convent is a compression which in order to triumph over the human heart should last during the whole life on quitting the convent cosette could have found nothing more sweet and more dangerous than the house in the rue plumet it was the continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty a garden that was closed but a
1228,nature that was acrid rich voluptuous and fragrant the same dreams as in the convent but with glimpses of young men a grating but one that opened on the street still when she arrived there we repeat she was only a child jean valjean gave this neglected garden over to her do what you like with it he said to her this amused cosette she turned over all the clumps and all the stones she hunted for beasts she played in it while awaiting the time when she would dream in it she loved this garden for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass while awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see through the boughs above her head and then she loved her father that is to say jean valjean with all her soul with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a beloved and charming companion to her it will be remembered that m madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal jean valjean had continued this practice he had come to converse well he possessed the secret riches and the eloquence of
1229,a true and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself he retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness his mind was rough and his heart was soft during their conversations in the luxembourg he gave her explanations of everything drawing on what he had read and also on what he had suffered as she listened to him cosette's eyes wandered vaguely about this simple man sufficed for cosette's thought the same as the wild garden sufficed for her eyes when she had had a good chase after the butterflies she came panting up to him and said ah how i have run he kissed her brow cosette adored the goodman she was always at his heels where jean valjean was there happiness was jean valjean lived neither in the pavilion nor the garden she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard than in the enclosure filled with flowers and in his little lodge furnished with straw seated chairs than in the great drawing room hung with tapestry against which stood tufted easy chairs jean valjean sometimes said to her smiling at his happiness in being importuned do go to your own quarters leave me alone a little she
1230,gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful when they come from a daughter to her father father i am very cold in your rooms why don't you have a carpet here and a stove dear child there are so many people who are better than i and who have not even a roof over their heads then why is there a fire in my rooms and everything that is needed because you are a woman and a child bah must men be cold and feel uncomfortable certain men that is good i shall come here so often that you will be obliged to have a fire and again she said to him father why do you eat horrible bread like that because my daughter well if you eat it i will eat it too then in order to prevent cosette eating black bread jean valjean ate white bread cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood she prayed morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known the thenardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream she remembered that she had gone one day at night to fetch water
1231,in a forest she thought that it had been very far from paris it seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss and that it was jean valjean who had rescued her from it her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds spiders and serpents when she meditated in the evening before falling asleep as she had not a very clear idea that she was jean valjean's daughter and that he was her father she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her when he was seated she leaned her cheek against his white hair and dropped a silent tear saying to herself perhaps this man is my mother cosette although this is a strange statement to make in the profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent maternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity had ended by fancying that she had had as little mother as possible she did not even know her mother's name whenever she asked jean valjean jean valjean remained silent if she repeated her question he
1232,responded with a smile once she insisted the smile ended in a tear this silence on the part of jean valjean covered fantine with darkness was it prudence was it respect was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own so long as cosette had been small jean valjean had been willing to talk to her of her mother when she became a young girl it was impossible for him to do so it seemed to him that he no longer dared was it because of cosette was it because of fantine he felt a certain religious horror at letting that shadow enter cosette's thought and of placing a third in their destiny the more sacred this shade was to him the more did it seem that it was to be feared he thought of fantine and felt himself overwhelmed with silence through the darkness he vaguely perceived something which appeared to have its finger on its lips had all the modesty which had been in fantine and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime returned to rest upon her after her death to watch in indignation over the
1233,peace of that dead woman and in its shyness to keep her in her grave was jean valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure we who believe in death are not among the number who will reject this mysterious explanation hence the impossibility of uttering even for cosette that name of fantine one day cosette said to him father i saw my mother in a dream last night she had two big wings my mother must have been almost a saint during her life through martyrdom replied jean valjean however jean valjean was happy when cosette went out with him she leaned on his arm proud and happy in the plenitude of her heart jean valjean felt his heart melt within him with delight at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive so wholly satisfied with himself alone the poor man trembled inundated with angelic joy he declared to himself ecstatically that this would last all their lives he told himself that he really had not suffered sufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss and he thanked god in the depths of his soul for having permitted him to be loved thus he a wretch by that innocent being v
1234,the rose perceives that it is an engine of war one day cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror and she said to herself really it seemed to her almost that she was pretty this threw her in a singularly troubled state of mind up to that moment she had never thought of her face she saw herself in her mirror but she did not look at herself and then she had so often been told that she was homely jean valjean alone said gently no indeed no indeed at all events cosette had always thought herself homely and had grown up in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood and here all at once was her mirror saying to her as jean valjean had said no indeed that night she did not sleep what if i were pretty she thought how odd it would be if i were pretty and she recalled those of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent and she said to herself what am i to be like mademoiselle so and so the next morning she looked at herself again not by accident this time and she was
1235,assailed with doubts where did i get such an idea said she no i am ugly she had not slept well that was all her eyes were sunken and she was pale she had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer she did not look at herself again and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror in the evening after dinner she generally embroidered in wool or did some convent needlework in the drawing room and jean valjean read beside her once she raised her eyes from her work and was rendered quite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her on another occasion she was passing along the street and it seemed to her that some one behind her whom she did not see said a pretty woman but badly dressed bah she thought he does not mean me i am well dressed and ugly she was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown at last one day
1236,when she was in the garden she heard poor old toussaint saying do you notice how pretty cosette is growing sir cosette did not hear her father's reply but toussaint's words caused a sort of commotion within her she fled from the garden ran up to her room flew to the looking glass it was three months since she had looked at herself and gave vent to a cry she had just dazzled herself she was beautiful and lovely she could not help agreeing with toussaint and her mirror her figure was formed her skin had grown white her hair was lustrous an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes the consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant like the sudden advent of daylight other people noticed it also toussaint had said so it was evidently she of whom the passer by had spoken there could no longer be any doubt of that she descended to the garden again thinking herself a queen imagining that she heard the birds singing though it was winter seeing the sky gilded the sun among the trees flowers in the thickets distracted wild in inexpressible delight jean valjean on
1237,his side experienced a deep and undefinable oppression at heart in fact he had for some time past been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on cosette's sweet face the dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became aware of it herself but from the very first day that unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl's person wounded jean valjean's sombre eye he felt that it was a change in a happy life a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear of disarranging something this man who had passed through all manner of distresses who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint who after having dragged the chain of the galleys was now dragging the invisible but heavy chain of indefinite misery this man whom the law had not released from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad
1238,daylight of public opprobrium this man accepted all excused all pardoned all and merely asked of providence of man of the law of society of nature of the world one thing that cosette might love him that cosette might continue to love him that god would not prevent the heart of the child from coming to him and from remaining with him beloved by cosette he felt that he was healed rested appeased loaded with benefits recompensed crowned beloved by cosette it was well with him he asked nothing more had any one said to him do you want anything better he would have answered no god might have said to him do you desire heaven and he would have replied i should lose by it everything which could affect this situation if only on the surface made him shudder like the beginning of something new he had never known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means but he understood instinctively that it was something terrible he gazed with terror on this beauty which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him beneath his very eyes on the innocent and formidable brow of that child
1239,from the depths of her homeliness of his old age of his misery of his reprobation he said to himself how beautiful she is what is to become of me there moreover lay the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother what he beheld with anguish a mother would have gazed upon with joy the first symptoms were not long in making their appearance on the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself decidedly i am beautiful cosette began to pay attention to her toilet she recalled the remark of that passer by pretty but badly dressed the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had vanished after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are destined later on to fill the whole life of woman coquetry love is the other with faith in her beauty the whole feminine soul expanded within her she conceived a horror for her merinos and shame for her plush hat her father had never refused her anything she at once acquired the whole science of the bonnet the gown the mantle the boot the cuff the stuff which is in
1240,fashion the color which is becoming that science which makes of the parisian woman something so charming so deep and so dangerous the words heady woman were invented for the parisienne in less than a month little cosette in that thebaid of the rue de babylone was not only one of the prettiest but one of the best dressed women in paris which means a great deal more she would have liked to encounter her passer by to see what he would say and to teach him a lesson the truth is that she was ravishing in every respect and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from gerard and one from herbaut in the most marvellous way jean valjean watched these ravages with anxiety he who felt that he could never do anything but crawl walk at the most beheld wings sprouting on cosette moreover from the mere inspection of cosette's toilet a woman would have recognized the fact that she had no mother certain little proprieties certain special conventionalities were not observed by cosette a mother for instance would have told her that a young girl does not dress in damask the first day that cosette went
1241,out in her black damask gown and mantle and her white crape bonnet she took jean valjean's arm gay radiant rosy proud dazzling father she said how do you like me in this guise jean valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious man charming he was the same as usual during their walk on their return home he asked cosette won't you put on that other gown and bonnet again you know the ones i mean this took place in cosette's chamber cosette turned towards the wardrobe where her cast off schoolgirl's clothes were hanging that disguise said she father what do you want me to do with it oh no the idea i shall never put on those horrors again with that machine on my head i have the air of madame mad dog jean valjean heaved a deep sigh from that moment forth he noticed that cosette who had always heretofore asked to remain at home saying father i enjoy myself more here with you now was always asking to go out in fact what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display
1242,them he also noticed that cosette had no longer the same taste for the back garden now she preferred the garden and did not dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the railed fence jean valjean who was shy never set foot in the garden he kept to his back yard like a dog cosette in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful lost the grace of ignoring it an exquisite grace for beauty enhanced by ingenuousness is ineffable and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent creature who walks along holding in her hand the key to paradise without being conscious of it but what she had lost in ingenuous grace she gained in pensive and serious charm her whole person permeated with the joy of youth of innocence and of beauty breathed forth a splendid melancholy it was at this epoch that marius after the lapse of six months saw her once more at the luxembourg vi the battle begun cosette in her shadow like marius in his was all ready to take fire destiny with its mysterious and fatal patience slowly drew together these two beings all charged and all languishing with the
1243,stormy electricity of passion these two souls which were laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning and which were bound to overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire the glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finally fallen into disrepute one hardly dares to say nowadays that two beings fell in love because they looked at each other that is the way people do fall in love nevertheless and the only way the rest is nothing but the rest comes afterwards nothing is more real than these great shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of that spark at that particular hour when cosette unconsciously darted that glance which troubled marius marius had no suspicion that he had also launched a look which disturbed cosette he caused her the same good and the same evil she had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time and she had scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see while looking elsewhere marius still considered cosette ugly when she had already begun to think marius handsome but as he paid no attention
1244,to her the young man was nothing to her still she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautiful hair beautiful eyes handsome teeth a charming tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades that he held himself badly when he walked if you like but with a grace that was all his own that he did not appear to be at all stupid that his whole person was noble gentle simple proud and that in short though he seemed to be poor yet his air was fine on the day when their eyes met at last and said to each other those first obscure and ineffable things which the glance lisps cosette did not immediately understand she returned thoughtfully to the house in the rue de l'ouest where jean valjean according to his custom had come to spend six weeks the next morning on waking she thought of that strange young man so long indifferent and icy who now seemed to pay attention to her and it did not appear to her that this attention was the least in the world agreeable to her she was on the contrary somewhat incensed at this
1245,handsome and disdainful individual a substratum of war stirred within her it struck her and the idea caused her a wholly childish joy that she was going to take her revenge at last knowing that she was beautiful she was thoroughly conscious though in an indistinct fashion that she possessed a weapon women play with their beauty as children do with a knife they wound themselves the reader will recall marius hesitations his palpitations his terrors he remained on his bench and did not approach this vexed cosette one day she said to jean valjean father let us stroll about a little in that direction seeing that marius did not come to her she went to him in such cases all women resemble mahomet and then strange to say the first symptom of true love in a young man is timidity in a young girl it is boldness this is surprising and yet nothing is more simple it is the two sexes tending to approach each other and assuming each the other's qualities that day cosette's glance drove marius beside himself and marius glance set cosette to trembling marius went away confident and cosette uneasy from that day forth they
1246,adored each other the first thing that cosette felt was a confused and profound melancholy it seemed to her that her soul had become black since the day before she no longer recognized it the whiteness of soul in young girls which is composed of coldness and gayety resembles snow it melts in love which is its sun cosette did not know what love was she had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense on the books of profane music which entered the convent amour love was replaced by tambour drum or pandour this created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big girls such as ah how delightful is the drum or pity is not a pandour but cosette had left the convent too early to have occupied herself much with the drum therefore she did not know what name to give to what she now felt is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one's malady she loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly she did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing useful or dangerous eternal or temporary allowable or prohibited
1247,she loved she would have been greatly astonished had any one said to her you do not sleep but that is forbidden you do not eat why that is very bad you have oppressions and palpitations of the heart that must not be you blush and turn pale when a certain being clad in black appears at the end of a certain green walk but that is abominable she would not have understood and she would have replied what fault is there of mine in a matter in which i have no power and of which i know nothing it turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to the state of her soul it was a sort of admiration at a distance a mute contemplation the deification of a stranger it was the apparition of youth to youth the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining a dream the longed for phantom realized and made flesh at last but having as yet neither name nor fault nor spot nor exigence nor defect in a word the distant lover who lingered in the ideal a chimaera with a form any nearer and more palpable meeting would
1248,have alarmed cosette at this first stage when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister she had all the fears of children and all the fears of nuns combined the spirit of the convent with which she had been permeated for the space of five years was still in the process of slow evaporation from her person and made everything tremble around her in this situation he was not a lover he was not even an admirer he was a vision she set herself to adoring marius as something charming luminous and impossible as extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry she smiled at him with all frankness every day she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience she found marius there she felt herself unspeakably happy and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to jean valjean what a delicious garden that luxembourg is marius and cosette were in the dark as to one another they did not address each other they did not salute each other they did not know each other they saw each other and like stars of heaven which are separated
1249,by millions of leagues they lived by gazing at each other it was thus that cosette gradually became a woman and developed beautiful and loving with a consciousness of her beauty and in ignorance of her love she was a coquette to boot through her ignorance vii to one sadness oppose a sadness and a half all situations have their instincts old and eternal mother nature warned jean valjean in a dim way of the presence of marius jean valjean shuddered to the very bottom of his soul jean valjean saw nothing knew nothing and yet he scanned with obstinate attention the darkness in which he walked as though he felt on one side of him something in process of construction and on the other something which was crumbling away marius also warned and in accordance with the deep law of god by that same mother nature did all he could to keep out of sight of the father nevertheless it came to pass that jean valjean sometimes espied him marius manners were no longer in the least natural he exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring he no longer came quite close to them as formerly he seated himself at
1250,a distance and pretended to be reading why did he pretend that formerly he had come in his old coat now he wore his new one every day jean valjean was not sure that he did not have his hair curled his eyes were very queer he wore gloves in short jean valjean cordially detested this young man cosette allowed nothing to be divined without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it and that it must be concealed there was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had recently come to cosette and the habit of new clothes developed by that stranger which was very repugnant to jean valjean it might be accidental no doubt certainly but it was a menacing accident he never opened his mouth to cosette about this stranger one day however he could not refrain from so doing and with that vague despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair he said to her what a very pedantic air that young man has cosette but a year before only an indifferent little girl would have replied why no he is
1251,charming ten years later with the love of marius in her heart she would have answered a pedant and insufferable to the sight you are right at the moment in life and the heart which she had then attained she contented herself with replying with supreme calmness that young man as though she now beheld him for the first time in her life how stupid i am thought jean valjean she had not noticed him it is i who have pointed him out to her oh simplicity of the old oh the depth of children it is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble of those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever and that the young man falls into every one jean valjean had instituted an undeclared war against marius which marius with the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age did not divine jean valjean laid a host of ambushes for him he changed his hour he changed his bench he forgot his handkerchief he came alone to the luxembourg marius dashed headlong into
1252,all these snares and to all the interrogation marks planted by jean valjean in his pathway he ingenuously answered yes but cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity so that jean valjean arrived at the following conclusion that ninny is madly in love with cosette but cosette does not even know that he exists none the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor the minute when cosette would love might strike at any moment does not everything begin with indifference only once did cosette make a mistake and alarm him he rose from his seat to depart after a stay of three hours and she said what already jean valjean had not discontinued his trips to the luxembourg as he did not wish to do anything out of the way and as above all things he feared to arouse cosette but during the hours which were so sweet to the lovers while cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated marius who perceived nothing else now and who now saw nothing in all the world but an adored and radiant face jean valjean was fixing on marius flashing and terrible eyes he
1253,who had finally come to believe himself incapable of a malevolent feeling experienced moments when marius was present in which he thought he was becoming savage and ferocious once more and he felt the old depths of his soul which had formerly contained so much wrath opening once more and rising up against that young man it almost seemed to him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom what he was there that creature what was he there for he came creeping about smelling out examining trying he came saying hey why not he came to prowl about his jean valjean's life to prowl about his happiness with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away jean valjean added yes that's it what is he in search of an adventure what does he want a love affair a love affair and i what i have been first the most wretched of men and then the most unhappy and i have traversed sixty years of life on my knees i have suffered everything that man can suffer i have grown old without having been young i have lived without a family without relatives without friends without life without children
1254,i have left my blood on every stone on every bramble on every mile post along every wall i have been gentle though others have been hard to me and kind although others have been malicious i have become an honest man once more in spite of everything i have repented of the evil that i have done and have forgiven the evil that has been done to me and at the moment when i receive my recompense at the moment when it is all over at the moment when i am just touching the goal at the moment when i have what i desire it is well it is good i have paid i have earned it all this is to take flight all this will vanish and i shall lose cosette and i shall lose my life my joy my soul because it has pleased a great booby to come and lounge at the luxembourg then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam it was no longer a man gazing at a man it was no longer an enemy surveying an enemy it was a dog scanning a thief the reader knows the rest marius
1255,pursued his senseless course one day he followed cosette to the rue de l'ouest another day he spoke to the porter the porter on his side spoke and said to jean valjean monsieur who is that curious young man who is asking for you on the morrow jean valjean bestowed on marius that glance which marius at last perceived a week later jean valjean had taken his departure he swore to himself that he would never again set foot either in the luxembourg or in the rue de l'ouest he returned to the rue plumet cosette did not complain she said nothing she asked no questions she did not seek to learn his reasons she had already reached the point where she was afraid of being divined and of betraying herself jean valjean had no experience of these miseries the only miseries which are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted the consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of cosette's silence he merely noticed that she had grown sad and he grew gloomy on his side and on hers inexperience had joined issue once he made a trial he asked cosette would
1256,you like to come to the luxembourg a ray illuminated cosette's pale face yes said she they went thither three months had elapsed marius no longer went there marius was not there on the following day jean valjean asked cosette again would you like to come to the luxembourg she replied sadly and gently no jean valjean was hurt by this sadness and heart broken at this gentleness what was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable what was on its way there within what was taking place in cosette's soul sometimes instead of going to bed jean valjean remained seated on his pallet with his head in his hands and he passed whole nights asking himself what has cosette in her mind and in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about oh at such moments what mournful glances did he cast towards that cloister that chaste peak that abode of angels that inaccessible glacier of virtue how he contemplated with despairing ecstasy that convent garden full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins where all perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven how he adored that eden forever closed
1257,against him whence he had voluntarily and madly emerged how he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought cosette back into the world poor hero of sacrifice seized and hurled to the earth by his very self devotion how he said to himself what have i done however nothing of all this was perceptible to cosette no ill temper no harshness his face was always serene and kind jean valjean's manners were more tender and more paternal than ever if anything could have betrayed his lack of joy it was his increased suavity on her side cosette languished she suffered from the absence of marius as she had rejoiced in his presence peculiarly without exactly being conscious of it when jean valjean ceased to take her on their customary strolls a feminine instinct murmured confusedly at the bottom of her heart that she must not seem to set store on the luxembourg garden and that if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her her father would take her thither once more but days weeks months elapsed jean valjean had tacitly accepted cosette's tacit consent she regretted it it was too late so marius had disappeared
1258,all was over the day on which she returned to the luxembourg marius was no longer there what was to be done should she ever find him again she felt an anguish at her heart which nothing relieved and which augmented every day she no longer knew whether it was winter or summer whether it was raining or shining whether the birds were singing whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies whether the luxembourg was more charming than the tuileries whether the linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not enough whether toussaint had done her marketing well or ill and she remained dejected absorbed attentive to but a single thought her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished however she did not allow jean valjean to perceive anything of this except her pallor she still wore her sweet face for him this pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble jean valjean sometimes he asked her what is the matter with you she replied there is nothing the matter with me and after a silence when she divined that he
1259,was sad also she would add and you father is there anything wrong with you with me nothing said he these two beings who had loved each other so exclusively and with so touching an affection and who had lived so long for each other now suffered side by side each on the other's account without acknowledging it to each other without anger towards each other and with a smile viii the chain gang jean valjean was the more unhappy of the two youth even in its sorrows always possesses its own peculiar radiance at times jean valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile it is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear he had an unconquerable conviction that cosette was escaping from him he would have liked to resist to retain her to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter these ideas puerile as we have just said and at the same time senile conveyed to him by their very childishness a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls he once chanced to see a general on horseback in full uniform pass
1260,along the street comte coutard the commandant of paris he envied that gilded man what happiness it would be he said to himself if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing and if cosette could behold him thus she would be dazzled and when he had cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the tuileries the guard would present arms to him and that would suffice for cosette and would dispel her idea of looking at young men an unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections in the isolated life which they led and since they had come to dwell in the rue plumet they had contracted one habit they sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sun rise a mild species of enjoyment which befits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it for those who love solitude a walk in the early morning is equivalent to a stroll by night with the cheerfulness of nature added the streets are deserted and the birds are singing cosette a bird herself liked to rise early these matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding evening he proposed and she agreed
1261,it was arranged like a plot they set out before daybreak and these trips were so many small delights for cosette these innocent eccentricities please young people jean valjean's inclination led him as we have seen to the least frequented spots to solitary nooks to forgotten places there then existed in the vicinity of the barriers of paris a sort of poor meadows which were almost confounded with the city where grew in summer sickly grain and which in autumn after the harvest had been gathered presented the appearance not of having been reaped but peeled jean valjean loved to haunt these fields cosette was not bored there it meant solitude to him and liberty to her there she became a little girl once more she could run and almost play she took off her hat laid it on jean valjean's knees and gathered bunches of flowers she gazed at the butterflies on the flowers but did not catch them gentleness and tenderness are born with love and the young girl who cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly she wove garlands of poppies which she placed on her head
1262,and which crossed and penetrated with sunlight glowing until they flamed formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers even after their life had grown sad they kept up their custom of early strolls one morning in october therefore tempted by the serene perfection of the autumn of they set out and found themselves at break of day near the barriere du maine it was not dawn it was daybreak a delightful and stern moment a few constellations here and there in the deep pale azure the earth all black the heavens all white a quiver amid the blades of grass everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight a lark which seemed mingled with the stars was carolling at a prodigious height and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity in the east the valde grace projected its dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice all was peace and silence there was no one on the road a few stray laborers of whom they caught barely a glimpse were
1263,on their way to their work along the side paths jean valjean was sitting in a cross walk on some planks deposited at the gate of a timber yard his face was turned towards the highway his back towards the light he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated which imprison even the eye and which are equivalent to four walls there are meditations which may be called vertical when one is at the bottom of them time is required to return to earth jean valjean had plunged into one of these reveries he was thinking of cosette of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her of the light with which she filled his life a light which was but the emanation of her soul he was almost happy in his revery cosette who was standing beside him was gazing at the clouds as they turned rosy all at once cosette exclaimed father i should think some one was coming yonder jean valjean raised his eyes cosette was right the causeway which leads to the ancient
1264,barriere du maine is a prolongation as the reader knows of the rue de sevres and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard at the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard at the spot where it branches they heard a noise which it was difficult to account for at that hour and a sort of confused pile made its appearance some shapeless thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning into the road it grew larger it seemed to move in an orderly manner though it was bristling and quivering it seemed to be a vehicle but its load could not be distinctly made out there were horses wheels shouts whips were cracking by degrees the outlines became fixed although bathed in shadows it was a vehicle in fact which had just turned from the boulevard into the highway and which was directing its course towards the barrier near which sat jean valjean a second of the same aspect followed then a third then a fourth seven chariots made their appearance in succession the heads of the horses touching the rear of the wagon in front figures were moving on these vehicles flashes were visible through
1265,the dusk as though there were naked swords there a clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains and as this something advanced the sound of voices waxed louder and it turned into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams as it drew nearer it assumed a form and was outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition the mass grew white the day which was slowly dawning cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses and this is what it proved to be seven wagons were driving in a file along the road the first six were singularly constructed they resembled coopers drays they consisted of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities each dray or rather let us say each ladder was attached to four horses harnessed tandem on these ladders strange clusters of men were being drawn in the faint light these men were to be divined rather than seen twenty four on each vehicle twelve on a side back to back facing the
1266,passers by their legs dangling in the air this was the manner in which these men were travelling and behind their backs they had something which clanked and which was a chain and on their necks something which shone and which was an iron collar each man had his collar but the chain was for all so that if these four and twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk they were seized with a sort of inexorable unity and were obliged to wind over the ground with the chain for a backbone somewhat after the fashion of millepeds in the back and front of each vehicle two men armed with muskets stood erect each holding one end of the chain under his foot the iron necklets were square the seventh vehicle a huge rack sided baggage wagon without a hood had four wheels and six horses and carried a sonorous pile of iron boilers cast iron pots braziers and chains among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and stretched at full length and who seemed to be ill this wagon all lattice work was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served for
1267,former punishments these vehicles kept to the middle of the road on each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect wearing three cornered hats like the soldiers under the directory shabby covered with spots and holes muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers of undertakers men half gray half blue which were almost hanging in rags with red epaulets yellow shoulder belts short sabres muskets and cudgels they were a species of soldier blackguards these myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the authority of the executioner the one who appeared to be their chief held a postilion's whip in his hand all these details blurred by the dimness of dawn became more and more clearly outlined as the light increased at the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted gendarmes serious and with sword in fist this procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the barrier the last was barely debauching from the boulevard a throng sprung it is impossible to say whence and formed in a twinkling as is frequently the case in paris pressed forward from both sides of the road and looked on
1268,in the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to each other and the wooden shoes of market gardeners hastening up to gaze were audible the men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in silence they were livid with the chill of morning they all wore linen trousers and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes the rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness their accoutrements were horribly incongruous nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in rags battered felt hats tarpaulin caps hideous woollen nightcaps and side by side with a short blouse a black coat broken at the elbow many wore women's headgear others had baskets on their heads hairy breasts were visible and through the rent in their garments tattooed designs could be descried temples of love flaming hearts cupids eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen two or three had a straw rope attached to the cross bar of the dray and suspended under them like a stirrup which supported their feet one of them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed
1269,to be gnawing it was bread which he was eating there were no eyes there which were not either dry dulled or flaming with an evil light the escort troop cursed the men in chains did not utter a syllable from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder blades or skulls some of these men were yawning their rags were terrible their feet hung down their shoulders oscillated their heads clashed together their fetters clanked their eyes glared ferociously their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter this file of vehicles whatever its nature was was mournful it was evident that to morrow that an hour hence a pouring rain might descend that it might be followed by another and another and that their dilapidated garments would be drenched that once soaked these men would not get dry again that once chilled they would not again get warm that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the downpour that the water would fill their shoes that no lashes from the
1270,whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering that the chain would continue to bind them by the neck that their legs would continue to dangle and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn and delivered over to the rain to the blast to all the furies of the air like trees and stones blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with misery suddenly the sun made its appearance the immense light of the orient burst forth and one would have said that it had set fire to all those ferocious heads their tongues were unloosed a conflagration of grins oaths and songs exploded the broad horizontal sheet of light severed the file in two parts illuminating heads and bodies leaving feet and wheels in the obscurity thoughts made their appearance on these faces it was a terrible moment visible demons with their masks removed fierce souls laid bare though lighted
1271,up this wild throng remained in gloom some who were gay had in their mouths quills through which they blew vermin over the crowd picking out the women the dawn accentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of wretchedness and the whole was so monstrous that one would have said that the sun's brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the lightning the wagon load which headed the line had struck up a song and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality a potpourri by desaugiers then famous called the vestal the trees shivered mournfully in the cross lanes countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by spectres all sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos here were to be found the facial angles of every sort of beast old men youths bald heads gray beards cynical monstrosities sour resignation savage grins senseless attitudes snouts surmounted by caps heads like those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples infantile visages and by reason of that horrible thin
1272,skeleton faces to which death alone was lacking on the first cart was a negro who had been a slave in all probability and who could make a comparison of his chains the frightful leveller from below shame had passed over these brows at that degree of abasement the last transformations were suffered by all in their extremest depths and ignorance converted into dulness was the equal of intelligence converted into despair there was no choice possible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud it was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that unclean procession had not classified them these beings had been fettered and coupled pell mell in alphabetical disorder probably and loaded hap hazard on those carts nevertheless horrors when grouped together always end by evolving a result all additions of wretched men give a sum total each chain exhaled a common soul and each dray load had its own physiognomy by the side of the one where they were singing there was one where they were howling a third where they were begging one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth another load
1273,menaced the spectators another blasphemed god the last was as silent as the tomb dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march the march of the damned to their tortures performed in sinister wise not on the formidable and flaming chariot of the apocalypse but what was more mournful than that on the gibbet cart one of the guards who had a hook on the end of his cudgel made a pretence from time to time of stirring up this mass of human filth an old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years old and said to him rascal let that be a warning to you as the songs and blasphemies increased the man who appeared to be the captain of the escort cracked his whip and at that signal a fearful dull and blind flogging which produced the sound of hail fell upon the seven dray loads many roared and foamed at the mouth which redoubled the delight of the street urchins who had hastened up a swarm of flies on these wounds jean valjean's eyes had assumed a frightful expression they were no longer eyes
1274,they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the glance in the case of certain wretched men which seem unconscious of reality and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of catastrophes he was not looking at a spectacle he was seeing a vision he tried to rise to flee to make his escape he could not move his feet sometimes the things that you see seize upon you and hold you fast he remained nailed to the spot petrified stupid asking himself athwart confused and inexpressible anguish what this sepulchral persecution signified and whence had come that pandemonium which was pursuing him all at once he raised his hand to his brow a gesture habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns he remembered that this was in fact the usual itinerary that it was customary to make this detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the road to fontainebleau and that five and thirty years before he had himself passed through that barrier cosette was no less terrified but in a different way she did not understand what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible at length she cried father
1275,what are those men in those carts jean valjean replied convicts whither are they going to the galleys at that moment the cudgelling multiplied by a hundred hands became zealous blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it it was a perfect storm of whips and clubs the convicts bent before it a hideous obedience was evoked by the torture and all held their peace darting glances like chained wolves cosette trembled in every limb she resumed father are they still men sometimes answered the unhappy man it was the chain gang in fact which had set out before daybreak from bicetre and had taken the road to mans in order to avoid fontainebleau where the king then was this caused the horrible journey to last three or four days longer but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it jean valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed such encounters are shocks and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough shaking up nevertheless jean valjean did not observe that on his way back to the rue de babylone with cosette the latter was plying him with other
1276,questions on the subject of what they had just seen perhaps he was too much absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply to them but when cosette was leaving him in the evening to betake herself to bed he heard her say in a low voice and as though talking to herself it seems to me that if i were to find one of those men in my pathway oh my god i should die merely from the sight of him close at hand fortunately chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day there was some official solemnity apropos of i know not what fetes in paris a review in the champ de mars jousts on the seine theatrical performances in the champs elysees fireworks at the arc de l'etoile illuminations everywhere jean valjean did violence to his habits and took cosette to see these rejoicings for the purpose of diverting her from the memory of the day before and of effacing beneath the smiling tumult of all paris the abominable thing which had passed before her the review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms perfectly natural jean valjean
1277,donned his uniform of a national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking himself to shelter however this trip seemed to attain its object cosette who made it her law to please her father and to whom moreover all spectacles were a novelty accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of youth and did not pout too disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fete so that jean valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded and that no trace of that hideous vision remained some days later one morning when the sun was shining brightly and they were both on the steps leading to the garden another infraction of the rules which jean valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused cosette to adopt cosette in a wrapper was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star and with her head bathed in light rosy after a good sleep submitting to the gentle glances of
1278,the tender old man she was picking a daisy to pieces cosette did not know the delightful legend i love a little passionately etc who was there who could have taught her she was handling the flower instinctively innocently without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart if there were a fourth and smiling grace called melancholy she would have worn the air of that grace jean valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower and forgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by that child a red breast was warbling in the thicket on one side white cloudlets floated across the sky so gayly that one would have said that they had just been set at liberty cosette went on attentively tearing the leaves from her flower she seemed to be thinking about something but whatever it was it must be something charming all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the delicate languor of a swan and said to jean valjean father what are the galleys like fourth succor from below may turn out to be succor from on high i
1279,a wound without healing within thus their life clouded over by degrees but one diversion which had formerly been a happiness remained to them which was to carry bread to those who were hungry and clothing to those who were cold cosette often accompanied jean valjean on these visits to the poor on which they recovered some remnants of their former free intercourse and sometimes when the day had been a good one and they had assisted many in distress and cheered and warmed many little children cosette was rather merry in the evening it was at this epoch that they paid their visit to the jondrette den on the day following that visit jean valjean made his appearance in the pavilion in the morning calm as was his wont but with a large wound on his left arm which was much inflamed and very angry which resembled a burn and which he explained in some way or other this wound resulted in his being detained in the house for a month with fever he would not call in a doctor when cosette urged him call the dog doctor said he cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so
1280,divine an air and such angelic happiness at being of use to him that jean valjean felt all his former joy returning his fears and anxieties dissipating and he gazed at cosette saying oh what a kindly wound oh what a good misfortune cosette on perceiving that her father was ill had deserted the pavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard she passed nearly all her days beside jean valjean and read to him the books which he desired generally they were books of travel jean valjean was undergoing a new birth his happiness was reviving in these ineffable rays the luxembourg the prowling young stranger cosette's coldness all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim he had reached the point where he said to himself i imagined all that i am an old fool his happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the thenardiers made in the jondrette hovel unexpected as it was had after a fashion glided over him unnoticed he had succeeded in making his escape all trace of him was lost what more did he care for he only thought of those wretched beings to pity
1281,them here they are in prison and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm he thought but what a lamentable family in distress as for the hideous vision of the barriere du maine cosette had not referred to it again sister sainte mechtilde had taught cosette music in the convent cosette had the voice of a linnet with a soul and sometimes in the evening in the wounded man's humble abode she warbled melancholy songs which delighted jean valjean spring came the garden was so delightful at that season of the year that jean valjean said to cosette you never go there i want you to stroll in it as you like father said cosette and for the sake of obeying her father she resumed her walks in the garden generally alone for as we have mentioned jean valjean who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence hardly ever went there jean valjean's wound had created a diversion when cosette saw that her father was suffering less that he was convalescing and that he appeared to be happy she experienced a contentment which she did not even perceive so gently and naturally had it come then
1282,it was in the month of march the days were growing longer the winter was departing the winter always bears away with it a portion of our sadness then came april that daybreak of summer fresh as dawn always is gay like every childhood a little inclined to weep at times like the new born being that it is in that month nature has charming gleams which pass from the sky from the trees from the meadows and the flowers into the heart of man cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that april joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself insensibly and without her suspecting the fact the blackness departed from her spirit in spring sad souls grow light as light falls into cellars at midday cosette was no longer sad however though this was so she did not account for it to herself in the morning about ten o'clock after breakfast when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden for a quarter of an hour and when she was pacing up and down in the sunlight in front of the steps supporting his left arm for him she did
1283,not perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy jean valjean intoxicated beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more oh what a good wound he repeated in a whisper and he felt grateful to the thenardiers his wound once healed he resumed his solitary twilight strolls it is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that fashion in the uninhabited regions of paris without meeting with some adventure ii mother plutarque finds no difficulty in explaining a phenomenon one evening little gavroche had had nothing to eat he remembered that he had not dined on the preceding day either this was becoming tiresome he resolved to make an effort to secure some supper he strolled out beyond the salpetriere into deserted regions that is where windfalls are to be found where there is no one one always finds something he reached a settlement which appeared to him to be the village of austerlitz in one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old man and an old woman and in that garden a passable apple tree beside the apple tree stood a sort of fruit
1284,house which was not securely fastened and where one might contrive to get an apple one apple is a supper one apple is life that which was adam's ruin might prove gavroche's salvation the garden abutted on a solitary unpaved lane bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses the garden was separated from it by a hedge gavroche directed his steps towards this garden he found the lane he recognized the apple tree he verified the fruit house he examined the hedge a hedge means merely one stride the day was declining there was not even a cat in the lane the hour was propitious gavroche began the operation of scaling the hedge then suddenly paused some one was talking in the garden gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in the hedge a couple of paces distant at the foot of the hedge on the other side exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have been made there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench and on this bench was seated the old man of the garden while the old woman was standing in front of him the old
1285,woman was grumbling gavroche who was not very discreet listened monsieur mabeuf said the old woman mabeuf thought gavroche that name is a perfect farce the old man who was thus addressed did not stir the old woman repeated monsieur mabeuf the old man without raising his eyes from the ground made up his mind to answer what is it mother plutarque mother plutarque thought gavroche another farcical name mother plutarque began again and the old man was forced to accept the conversation the landlord is not pleased why we owe three quarters rent in three months we shall owe him for four quarters he says that he will turn you out to sleep i will go the green grocer insists on being paid she will no longer leave her fagots what will you warm yourself with this winter we shall have no wood there is the sun the butcher refuses to give credit he will not let us have any more meat that is quite right i do not digest meat well it is too heavy what shall we have for dinner bread the baker demands a settlement and says no money no bread that is well what will
1286,you eat we have apples in the apple room but monsieur we can't live like that without money i have none the old woman went away the old man remained alone he fell into thought gavroche became thoughtful also it was almost dark the first result of gavroche's meditation was that instead of scaling the hedge he crouched down under it the branches stood apart a little at the foot of the thicket come exclaimed gavroche mentally here's a nook and he curled up in it his back was almost in contact with father mabeuf's bench he could hear the octogenarian breathe then by way of dinner he tried to sleep it was a cat nap with one eye open while he dozed gavroche kept on the watch the twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth and the lane formed a livid line between two rows of dark bushes all at once in this whitish band two figures made their appearance one was in front the other some distance in the rear there come two creatures muttered gavroche the first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois who was bent and thoughtful dressed more than plainly and who was
1287,walking slowly because of his age and strolling about in the open evening air the second was straight firm slender it regulated its pace by that of the first but in the voluntary slowness of its gait suppleness and agility were discernible this figure had also something fierce and disquieting about it the whole shape was that of what was then called an elegant the hat was of good shape the coat black well cut probably of fine cloth and well fitted in at the waist the head was held erect with a sort of robust grace and beneath the hat the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light the profile had a rose in its mouth this second form was well known to gavroche it was montparnasse he could have told nothing about the other except that he was a respectable old man gavroche immediately began to take observations one of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with the other gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events the bedroom had turned into a hiding place at a very opportune moment montparnasse on the hunt at such an
1288,hour in such a place betokened something threatening gavroche felt his gamin's heart moved with compassion for the old man what was he to do interfere one weakness coming to the aid of another it would be merely a laughing matter for montparnasse gavroche did not shut his eyes to the fact that the old man in the first place and the child in the second would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtable ruffian eighteen years of age while gavroche was deliberating the attack took place abruptly and hideously the attack of the tiger on the wild ass the attack of the spider on the fly montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose bounded upon the old man seized him by the collar grasped and clung to him and gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream a moment later one of these men was underneath the other groaning struggling with a knee of marble upon his breast only it was not just what gavroche had expected the one who lay on the earth was montparnasse the one who was on top was the old man all this took place a few paces distant from gavroche the old man had received the
1289,shock had returned it and that in such a terrible fashion that in a twinkling the assailant and the assailed had exchanged roles here's a hearty veteran thought gavroche he could not refrain from clapping his hands but it was applause wasted it did not reach the combatants absorbed and deafened as they were each by the other as their breath mingled in the struggle silence ensued montparnasse ceased his struggles gavroche indulged in this aside can he be dead the goodman had not uttered a word nor given vent to a cry he rose to his feet and gavroche heard him say to montparnasse get up montparnasse rose but the goodman held him fast montparnasse's attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has been caught by a sheep gavroche looked on and listened making an effort to reinforce his eyes with his ears he was enjoying himself immensely he was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a spectator he was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed from the darkness an indescribably tragic accent the goodman questioned montparnasse replied how old are you nineteen you are strong and healthy
1290,why do you not work it bores me what is your trade an idler speak seriously can anything be done for you what would you like to be a thief a pause ensued the old man seemed absorbed in profound thought he stood motionless and did not relax his hold on montparnasse every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the twitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare he gave a jerk tried a crook of the knee twisted his limbs desperately and made efforts to escape the old man did not appear to notice it and held both his arms with one hand with the sovereign indifference of absolute force the old man's revery lasted for some time then looking steadily at montparnasse he addressed to him in a gentle voice in the midst of the darkness where they stood a solemn harangue of which gavroche did not lose a single syllable my child you are entering through indolence on one of the most laborious of lives ah you declare yourself to be an idler prepare to toil there is a certain formidable machine have you seen it it is the rolling mill you must

1297,is thieving believe me do not undertake that painful profession of an idle man it is not comfortable to become a rascal it is less disagreeable to be an honest man now go and ponder on what i have said to you by the way what did you want of me my purse here it is and the old man releasing montparnasse put his purse in the latter's hand montparnasse weighed it for a moment after which he allowed it to slide gently into the back pocket of his coat with the same mechanical precaution as though he had stolen it all this having been said and done the goodman turned his back and tranquilly resumed his stroll the blockhead muttered montparnasse who was this goodman the reader has no doubt already divined montparnasse watched him with amazement as he disappeared in the dusk this contemplation was fatal to him while the old man was walking away gavroche drew near gavroche had assured himself with a sidelong glance that father mabeuf was still sitting on his bench probably sound asleep then the gamin emerged from his thicket and began to crawl after montparnasse in the dark as the latter stood
1298,there motionless in this manner he came up to montparnasse without being seen or heard gently insinuated his hand into the back pocket of that frock coat of fine black cloth seized the purse withdrew his hand and having recourse once more to his crawling he slipped away like an adder through the shadows montparnasse who had no reason to be on his guard and who was engaged in thought for the first time in his life perceived nothing when gavroche had once more attained the point where father mabeuf was he flung the purse over the hedge and fled as fast as his legs would carry him the purse fell on father mabeuf's foot this commotion roused him he bent over and picked up the purse he did not understand in the least and opened it the purse had two compartments in one of them there was some small change in the other lay six napoleons m mabeuf in great alarm referred the matter to his housekeeper that has fallen from heaven said mother plutarque fifth the end of which does not resemble the beginning i solitude and the barracks combined cosette's grief which had been so poignant and
1299,lively four or five months previously had without her being conscious of the fact entered upon its convalescence nature spring youth love for her father the gayety of the birds and flowers caused something almost resembling forgetfulness to filter gradually drop by drop into that soul which was so virgin and so young was the fire wholly extinct there or was it merely that layers of ashes had formed the truth is that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any longer one day she suddenly thought of marius why said she i no longer think of him that same week she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers with a wasp like waist a delicious uniform the cheeks of a young girl a sword under his arm waxed mustaches and a glazed schapka passing the gate moreover he had light hair prominent blue eyes a round face was vain insolent and good looking quite the reverse of marius he had a cigar in his mouth cosette thought that this officer doubtless belonged to the regiment in barracks in the rue de babylone on the following day she saw him pass again she took note of the hour from
1300,that time forth was it chance she saw him pass nearly every day the officer's comrades perceived that there was in that badly kept garden behind that malicious rococo fence a very pretty creature who was almost always there when the handsome lieutenant who is not unknown to the reader and whose name was theodule gillenormand passed by see here they said to him there's a little creature there who is making eyes at you look have i the time replied the lancer to look at all the girls who look at me this was at the precise moment when marius was descending heavily towards agony and was saying if i could but see her before i die had his wish been realized had he beheld cosette at that moment gazing at the lancer he would not have been able to utter a word and he would have expired with grief whose fault was it no one's marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves in sorrow and there abide cosette was one of those persons who plunge into sorrow and emerge from it again cosette was moreover passing through that dangerous period the fatal phase of feminine revery
1301,abandoned to itself in which the isolated heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling as chance directs to the capital of a marble column or to the post of a wine shop a rapid and decisive moment critical for every orphan be she rich or poor for wealth does not prevent a bad choice misalliances are made in very high circles real misalliance is that of souls and as many an unknown young man without name without birth without fortune is a marble column which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand ideas so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent who has polished boots and varnished words if looked at not outside but inside a thing which is reserved for his wife is nothing more than a block obscurely haunted by violent unclean and vinous passions the post of a drinking shop what did cosette's soul contain passion calmed or lulled to sleep something limpid brilliant troubled to a certain depth and gloomy lower down the image of the handsome officer was reflected in the surface did a souvenir linger in the depths quite at the bottom
1302,possibly cosette did not know a singular incident supervened ii cosette's apprehensions during the first fortnight in april jean valjean took a journey this as the reader knows happened from time to time at very long intervals he remained absent a day or two days at the utmost where did he go no one knew not even cosette once only on the occasion of one of these departures she had accompanied him in a hackney coach as far as a little blind alley at the corner of which she read impasse de la planchette there he alighted and the coach took cosette back to the rue de babylone it was usually when money was lacking in the house that jean valjean took these little trips so jean valjean was absent he had said i shall return in three days that evening cosette was alone in the drawing room in order to get rid of her ennui she had opened her piano organ and had begun to sing accompanying herself the while the chorus from euryanthe hunters astray in the wood which is probably the most beautiful thing in all the sphere of music when she had finished she remained wrapped
1303,in thought all at once it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in the garden it could not be her father he was absent it could not be toussaint she was in bed and it was ten o'clock at night she stepped to the shutter of the drawing room which was closed and laid her ear against it it seemed to her that it was the tread of a man and that he was walking very softly she mounted rapidly to the first floor to her own chamber opened a small wicket in her shutter and peeped into the garden the moon was at the full everything could be seen as plainly as by day there was no one there she opened the window the garden was absolutely calm and all that was visible was that the street was deserted as usual cosette thought that she had been mistaken she thought that she had heard a noise it was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and magnificent chorus of weber which lays open before the mind terrified depths which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest and in which one hears the crackling of dead
1304,branches beneath the uneasy tread of the huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight she thought no more about it moreover cosette was not very timid by nature there flowed in her veins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs barefoot it will be remembered that she was more of a lark than a dove there was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her on the following day at an earlier hour towards nightfall she was strolling in the garden in the midst of the confused thoughts which occupied her she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similar to that of the preceding evening as though some one were walking beneath the trees in the dusk and not very far from her but she told herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved from side to side and she paid no heed to it besides she could see nothing she emerged from the thicket she had still to cross a small lawn to regain the steps the moon which had just risen behind her cast cosette's
1305,shadow in front of her upon this lawn as she came out from the shrubbery cosette halted in alarm beside her shadow the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another shadow which was particularly startling and terrible a shadow which had a round hat it was the shadow of a man who must have been standing on the border of the clump of shrubbery a few paces in the rear of cosette she stood for a moment without the power to speak or cry or call or stir or turn her head then she summoned up all her courage and turned round resolutely there was no one there she glanced on the ground the figure had disappeared she re entered the thicket searched the corners boldly went as far as the gate and found nothing she felt herself absolutely chilled with terror was this another hallucination what two days in succession one hallucination might pass but two hallucinations the disquieting point about it was that the shadow had assuredly not been a phantom phantoms do not wear round hats on the following day jean valjean returned cosette told him what she thought she had heard and seen she wanted to
1306,be reassured and to see her father shrug his shoulders and say to her you are a little goose jean valjean grew anxious it cannot be anything said he he left her under some pretext and went into the garden and she saw him examining the gate with great attention during the night she woke up this time she was sure and she distinctly heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window she ran to her little wicket and opened it in point of fact there was a man in the garden with a large club in his hand just as she was about to scream the moon lighted up the man's profile it was her father she returned to her bed saying to herself he is very uneasy jean valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the garden cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter on the third night the moon was on the wane and had begun to rise later at one o'clock in the morning possibly she heard a loud burst of laughter and her father's voice calling her cosette she jumped out of bed threw on
1307,her dressing gown and opened her window her father was standing on the grass plot below i have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you said he look there is your shadow with the round hat and he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon and which did indeed bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man wearing a round hat it was the shadow produced by a chimney pipe of sheet iron with a hood which rose above a neighboring roof cosette joined in his laughter all her lugubrious suppositions were allayed and the next morning as she was at breakfast with her father she made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron chimney pots jean valjean became quite tranquil once more as for cosette she did not pay much attention to the question whether the chimney pot was really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen or thought she had seen and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky she did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney pot which is afraid of being caught
1308,in the act and which retires when some one looks at its shadow for the shadow had taken the alarm when cosette had turned round and cosette had thought herself very sure of this cosette's serenity was fully restored the proof appeared to her to be complete and it quite vanished from her mind whether there could possibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or at night a few days later however a fresh incident occurred iii enriched with commentaries by toussaint in the garden near the railing on the street there was a stone bench screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke elms but which could in case of necessity be reached by an arm from the outside past the trees and the gate one evening during that same month of april jean valjean had gone out cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown the breeze was blowing briskly in the trees cosette was meditating an objectless sadness was taking possession of her little by little that invincible sadness evoked by the evening and which arises perhaps who knows from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar
1309,at that hour perhaps fantine was within that shadow cosette rose slowly made the tour of the garden walking on the grass drenched in dew and saying to herself through the species of melancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged really one needs wooden shoes for the garden at this hour one takes cold she returned to the bench as she was about to resume her seat there she observed on the spot which she had quitted a tolerably large stone which had evidently not been there a moment before cosette gazed at the stone asking herself what it meant all at once the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by itself that some one had placed it there that an arm had been thrust through the railing and this idea appeared to alarm her this time the fear was genuine the stone was there no doubt was possible she did not touch it fled without glancing behind her took refuge in the house and immediately closed with shutter bolt and bar the door like window opening on the flight of steps she inquired of toussaint has my father returned yet not yet
1310,mademoiselle we have already noted once for all the fact that toussaint stuttered may we be permitted to dispense with it for the future the musical notation of an infirmity is repugnant to us jean valjean a thoughtful man and given to nocturnal strolls often returned quite late at night toussaint went on cosette are you careful to thoroughly barricade the shutters opening on the garden at least with bars in the evening and to put the little iron things in the little rings that close them oh be easy on that score miss toussaint did not fail in her duty and cosette was well aware of the fact but she could not refrain from adding it is so solitary here so far as that is concerned said toussaint it is true we might be assassinated before we had time to say ouf and monsieur does not sleep in the house to boot but fear nothing miss i fasten the shutters up like prisons lone women that is enough to make one shudder i believe you just imagine what if you were to see men enter your chamber at night and say hold your tongue and begin to cut your
1311,throat it's not the dying so much you die for one must die and that's all right it's the abomination of feeling those people touch you and then their knives they can't be able to cut well with them ah good gracious be quiet said cosette fasten everything thoroughly cosette terrified by the melodrama improvised by toussaint and possibly also by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week which recurred to her memory dared not even say to her go and look at the stone which has been placed on the bench for fear of opening the garden gate and allowing the men to enter she saw that all the doors and windows were carefully fastened made toussaint go all over the house from garret to cellar locked herself up in her own chamber bolted her door looked under her couch went to bed and slept badly all night long she saw that big stone as large as a mountain and full of caverns at sunrise the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all our terrors of the past night and our laughter is in direct proportion to our terror which they have
1312,caused at sunrise cosette when she woke viewed her fright as a nightmare and said to herself what have i been thinking of it is like the footsteps that i thought i heard a week or two ago in the garden at night it is like the shadow of the chimney pot am i becoming a coward the sun which was glowing through the crevices in her shutters and turning the damask curtains crimson reassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from her thoughts even the stone there was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a round hat in the garden i dreamed about the stone as i did all the rest she dressed herself descended to the garden ran to the bench and broke out in a cold perspiration the stone was there but this lasted only for a moment that which is terror by night is curiosity by day bah said she come let us see what it is she lifted the stone which was tolerably large beneath it was something which resembled a letter it was a white envelope cosette seized it there was no address on one
1313,side no seal on the other yet the envelope though unsealed was not empty papers could be seen inside cosette examined it it was no longer alarm it was no longer curiosity it was a beginning of anxiety cosette drew from the envelope its contents a little notebook of paper each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and rather pretty handwriting as cosette thought cosette looked for a name there was none to whom was this addressed to her probably since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench from whom did it come an irresistible fascination took possession of her she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were trembling in her hand she gazed at the sky the street the acacias all bathed in light the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof and then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript and she said to herself that she must know what it contained this is what she read iv a heart beneath a stone the reduction of the universe to a single being the expansion of a single being even to god that is love love
1314,is the salutation of the angels to the stars how sad is the soul when it is sad through love what a void in the absence of the being who by herself alone fills the world oh how true it is that the beloved being becomes god one could comprehend that god might be jealous of this had not god the father of all evidently made creation for the soul and the soul for love the glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams god is behind everything but everything hides god things are black creatures are opaque to love a being is to render that being transparent certain thoughts are prayers there are moments when whatever the attitude of the body may be the soul is on its knees parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices which possess however a reality of their own they are prevented from seeing each other they cannot write to each other they discover a multitude of mysterious means to correspond they send each other the song of the birds the perfume of the
1315,flowers the smiles of children the light of the sun the sighings of the breeze the rays of stars all creation and why not all the works of god are made to serve love love is sufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages oh spring thou art a letter that i write to her the future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds love that is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity in the infinite the inexhaustible is requisite love participates of the soul itself it is of the same nature like it it is the divine spark like it it is incorruptible indivisible imperishable it is a point of fire that exists within us which is immortal and infinite which nothing can confine and which nothing can extinguish we feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones and we see it beaming in the very depths of heaven oh love adorations voluptuousness of two minds which understand each other of two hearts which exchange with each other of two glances which penetrate each other you will come to me will you not bliss strolls by twos in the
1316,solitudes blessed and radiant days i have sometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from the lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies of men god can add nothing to the happiness of those who love except to give them endless duration after a life of love an eternity of love is in fact an augmentation but to increase in intensity even the ineffable felicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world is impossible even to god god is the plenitude of heaven love is the plenitude of man you look at a star for two reasons because it is luminous and because it is impenetrable you have beside you a sweeter radiance and a greater mystery woman all of us whoever we may be have our respirable beings we lack air and we stifle then we die to die for lack of love is horrible suffocation of the soul when love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic unity the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are concerned they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the
1317,same destiny they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit love soar on the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she walks you are lost you love but one thing remains for you to do to think of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you what love commences can be finished by god alone true love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or a handkerchief found and eternity is required for its devotion and its hopes it is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely little if you are a stone be adamant if you are a plant be the sensitive plant if you are a man be love nothing suffices for love we have happiness we desire paradise we possess paradise we desire heaven oh ye who love each other all this is contained in love understand how to find it there love has contemplation as well as heaven and more than heaven it has voluptuousness does she still come to the luxembourg no sir this is the church where she attends mass is it not she no
1318,longer comes here does she still live in this house she has moved away where has she gone to dwell she did not say what a melancholy thing not to know the address of one's soul love has its childishness other passions have their pettinesses shame on the passions which belittle man honor to the one which makes a child of him there is one strange thing do you know it i dwell in the night there is a being who carried off my sky when she went away oh would that we were lying side by side in the same grave hand in hand and from time to time in the darkness gently caressing a finger that would suffice for my eternity ye who suffer because ye love love yet more to die of love is to live in it love a sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture there is ecstasy in agony oh joy of the birds it is because they have nests that they sing love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise deep hearts sage minds take life as god has made it it is a long trial an incomprehensible preparation
1319,for an unknown destiny this destiny the true one begins for a man with the first step inside the tomb then something appears to him and he begins to distinguish the definitive the definitive meditate upon that word the living perceive the infinite the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead in the meanwhile love and suffer hope and contemplate woe alas to him who shall have loved only bodies forms appearances death will deprive him of all try to love souls you will find them again i encountered in the street a very poor young man who was in love his hat was old his coat was worn his elbows were in holes water trickled through his shoes and the stars through his soul what a grand thing it is to be loved what a far grander thing it is to love the heart becomes heroic by dint of passion it is no longer composed of anything but what is pure it no longer rests on anything that is not elevated and great an unworthy thought can no more germinate in it than a nettle on a glacier the serene and lofty soul inaccessible to vulgar
1320,passions and emotions dominating the clouds and the shades of this world its follies its lies its hatreds its vanities its miseries inhabits the blue of heaven and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny as the crests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake if there did not exist some one who loved the sun would become extinct v cosette after the letter as cosette read she gradually fell into thought at the very moment when she raised her eyes from the last line of the note book the handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate it was his hour cosette thought him hideous she resumed her contemplation of the book it was written in the most charming of chirography thought cosette in the same hand but with divers inks sometimes very black again whitish as when ink has been added to the inkstand and consequently on different days it was then a mind which had unfolded itself there sigh by sigh irregularly without order without choice without object hap hazard cosette had never read anything like it this manuscript in which she already perceived more light than obscurity produced upon her the
1321,effect of a half open sanctuary each one of these mysterious lines shone before her eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance the education which she had received had always talked to her of the soul and never of love very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame this manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed to her all of love sorrow destiny life eternity the beginning the end it was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her a handful of rays of light in these few lines she felt a passionate ardent generous honest nature a sacred will an immense sorrow and an immense despair a suffering heart an ecstasy fully expanded what was this manuscript a letter a letter without name without address without date without signature pressing and disinterested an enigma composed of truths a message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth the love letter of a phantom to a shade it was an absent one tranquil and dejected who seemed ready to take refuge in death and
1322,who sent to the absent love his lady the secret of fate the key of life love this had been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven these lines which had fallen one by one on the paper were what might be called drops of soul now from whom could these pages come who could have penned them cosette did not hesitate a moment one man only he day had dawned once more in her spirit all had reappeared she felt an unheard of joy and a profound anguish it was he he who had written he was there it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing while she was forgetful of him he had found her again but had she forgotten him no never she was foolish to have thought so for a single moment she had always loved him always adored him the fire had been smothered and had smouldered for a time but she saw all plainly now it had but made headway and now it had burst forth afresh and had inflamed her whole being this note book was like a spark which had fallen from that other
1323,soul into hers she felt the conflagration starting up once more she imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript oh yes said she how perfectly i recognize all that that is what i had already read in his eyes as she was finishing it for the third time lieutenant theodule passed the gate once more and rattled his spurs upon the pavement cosette was forced to raise her eyes she thought him insipid silly stupid useless foppish displeasing impertinent and extremely ugly the officer thought it his duty to smile at her she turned away as in shame and indignation she would gladly have thrown something at his head she fled re entered the house and shut herself up in her chamber to peruse the manuscript once more to learn it by heart and to dream when she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her bosom all was over cosette had fallen back into deep seraphic love the abyss of eden had yawned once more all day long cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment she scarcely thought her ideas were in the state of a tangled skein in her brain she could
1324,not manage to conjecture anything she hoped through a tremor what vague things she dared make herself no promises and she did not wish to refuse herself anything flashes of pallor passed over her countenance and shivers ran through her frame it seemed to her at intervals that she was entering the land of chimaeras she said to herself is this reality then she felt of the dear paper within her bosom under her gown she pressed it to her heart she felt its angles against her flesh and if jean valjean had seen her at the moment he would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy which overflowed from beneath her eyelids oh yes she thought it is certainly he this comes from him and is for me and she told herself that an intervention of the angels a celestial chance had given him back to her oh transfiguration of love oh dreams that celestial chance that intervention of the angels was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief to another thief from the charlemagne courtyard to the lion's ditch over the roofs of la force vi old people are made to go out
1325,opportunely when evening came jean valjean went out cosette dressed herself she arranged her hair in the most becoming manner and she put on a dress whose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much and which through this slope permitted a view of the beginning of her throat and was as young girls say a trifle indecent it was not in the least indecent but it was prettier than usual she made her toilet thus without knowing why she did so did she mean to go out no was she expecting a visitor no at dusk she went down to the garden toussaint was busy in her kitchen which opened on the back yard she began to stroll about under the trees thrusting aside the branches from time to time with her hand because there were some which hung very low in this manner she reached the bench the stone was still there she sat down and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though she wished to caress and thank it all at once she experienced that indefinable impression which one undergoes when there is some one standing behind one even when she does
1326,not see the person she turned her head and rose to her feet it was he his head was bare he appeared to have grown thin and pale his black clothes were hardly discernible the twilight threw a wan light on his fine brow and covered his eyes in shadows beneath a veil of incomparable sweetness he had something about him that suggested death and night his face was illuminated by the light of the dying day and by the thought of a soul that is taking flight he seemed to be not yet a ghost and he was no longer a man he had flung away his hat in the thicket a few paces distant cosette though ready to swoon uttered no cry she retreated slowly for she felt herself attracted he did not stir by virtue of something ineffable and melancholy which enveloped him she felt the look in his eyes which she could not see cosette in her retreat encountered a tree and leaned against it had it not been for this tree she would have fallen then she heard his voice that voice which she had really never heard barely rising above the rustle of the
1327,leaves and murmuring pardon me here i am my heart is full i could not live on as i was living and i have come have you read what i placed there on the bench do you recognize me at all have no fear of me it is a long time you remember the day since you looked at me at the luxembourg near the gladiator and the day when you passed before me it was on the th of june and the d of july it is nearly a year ago i have not seen you for a long time i inquired of the woman who let the chairs and she told me that she no longer saw you you lived in the rue de l'ouest on the third floor in the front apartments of a new house you see that i know i followed you what else was there for me to do and then you disappeared i thought i saw you pass once while i was reading the newspapers under the arcade of the odeon i ran after you but no it was a person who had a bonnet like yours at night i came hither do
1328,not be afraid no one sees me i come to gaze upon your windows near at hand i walk very softly so that you may not hear for you might be alarmed the other evening i was behind you you turned round i fled once i heard you singing i was happy did it affect you because i heard you singing through the shutters that could not hurt you no it is not so you see you are my angel let me come sometimes i think that i am going to die if you only knew i adore you forgive me i speak to you but i do not know what i am saying i may have displeased you have i displeased you oh my mother said she and she sank down as though on the point of death he grasped her she fell he took her in his arms he pressed her close without knowing what he was doing he supported her though he was tottering himself it was as though his brain were full of smoke lightnings darted between his lips his ideas vanished it seemed to him that he was accomplishing some religious act and that he
1329,was committing a profanation moreover he had not the least passion for this lovely woman whose force he felt against his breast he was beside himself with love she took his hand and laid it on her heart he felt the paper there he stammered you love me then she replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more than a barely audible breath hush thou knowest it and she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb and intoxicated young man he fell upon the bench and she beside him they had no words more the stars were beginning to gleam how did it come to pass that their lips met how comes it to pass that the birds sing that snow melts that the rose unfolds that may expands that the dawn grows white behind the black trees on the shivering crest of the hills a kiss and that was all both started and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes they felt neither the cool night nor the cold stone nor the damp earth nor the wet grass they looked at each other and their hearts were full of thoughts they
1330,had clasped hands unconsciously she did not ask him she did not even wonder how he had entered there and how he had made his way into the garden it seemed so simple to her that he should be there from time to time marius knee touched cosette's knee and both shivered at intervals cosette stammered a word her soul fluttered on her lips like a drop of dew on a flower little by little they began to talk to each other effusion followed silence which is fulness the night was serene and splendid overhead these two beings pure as spirits told each other everything their dreams their intoxications their ecstasies their chimaeras their weaknesses how they had adored each other from afar how they had longed for each other their despair when they had ceased to see each other they confided to each other in an ideal intimacy which nothing could augment their most secret and most mysterious thoughts they related to each other with candid faith in their illusions all that love youth and the remains of childhood which still lingered about them suggested to their minds their two hearts poured themselves out into each other in such
1331,wise that at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it was the young man who had the young girl's soul and the young girl who had the young man's soul each became permeated with the other they were enchanted with each other they dazzled each other when they had finished when they had told each other everything she laid her head on his shoulder and asked him what is your name my name is marius said he and yours my name is cosette sixth little gavroche i the malicious playfulness of the wind since when the tavern of montfermeil was on the way to shipwreck and was being gradually engulfed not in the abyss of a bankruptcy but in the cesspool of petty debts the thenardier pair had had two other children both males that made five two girls and three boys madame thenardier had got rid of the last two while they were still young and very small with remarkable luck got rid of is the word there was but a mere fragment of nature in that woman a phenomenon by the way of which there is more than one example extant like the marechale de la
1332,mothe houdancourt the thenardier was a mother to her daughters only there her maternity ended her hatred of the human race began with her own sons in the direction of her sons her evil disposition was uncompromising and her heart had a lugubrious wall in that quarter as the reader has seen she detested the eldest she cursed the other two why because the most terrible of motives the most unanswerable of retorts because i have no need of a litter of squalling brats said this mother let us explain how the thenardiers had succeeded in getting rid of their last two children and even in drawing profit from the operation the woman magnon who was mentioned a few pages further back was the same one who had succeeded in making old gillenormand support the two children which she had had she lived on the quai des celestins at the corner of this ancient street of the petit musc which afforded her the opportunity of changing her evil repute into good odor the reader will remember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts of the seine in paris thirty five years ago and of which science took
1333,advantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of inhalations of alum so beneficially replaced at the present day by the external tincture of iodine during this epidemic the magnon lost both her boys who were still very young one in the morning the other in the evening of the same day this was a blow these children were precious to their mother they represented eighty francs a month these eighty francs were punctually paid in the name of m gillenormand by collector of his rents m barge a retired tip staff in the rue du roi de sicile the children dead the income was at an end the magnon sought an expedient in that dark free masonry of evil of which she formed a part everything is known all secrets are kept and all lend mutual aid magnon needed two children the thenardiers had two the same sex the same age a good arrangement for the one a good investment for the other the little thenardiers became little magnons magnon quitted the quai des celestins and went to live in the rue clocheperce in paris the identity which binds an individual to himself is broken
1334,between one street and another the registry office being in no way warned raised no objections and the substitution was effected in the most simple manner in the world only the thenardier exacted for this loan of her children ten francs a month which magnon promised to pay and which she actually did pay it is unnecessary to add that m gillenormand continued to perform his compact he came to see the children every six months he did not perceive the change monsieur magnon said to him how much they resemble you thenardier to whom avatars were easy seized this occasion to become jondrette his two daughters and gavroche had hardly had time to discover that they had two little brothers when a certain degree of misery is reached one is overpowered with a sort of spectral indifference and one regards human beings as though they were spectres your nearest relations are often no more for you than vague shadowy forms barely outlined against a nebulous background of life and easily confounded again with the invisible on the evening of the day when she had handed over her two little ones to magnon with express intention of renouncing them forever
1335,the thenardier had felt or had appeared to feel a scruple she said to her husband but this is abandoning our children thenardier masterful and phlegmatic cauterized the scruple with this saying jean jacques rousseau did even better from scruples the mother proceeded to uneasiness but what if the police were to annoy us tell me monsieur thenardier is what we have done permissible thenardier replied everything is permissible no one will see anything but true blue in it besides no one has any interest in looking closely after children who have not a sou magnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime she was careful about her toilet she shared her lodgings which were furnished in an affected and wretched style with a clever gallicized english thief this english woman who had become a naturalized parisienne recommended by very wealthy relations intimately connected with the medals in the library and mademoiselle mar's diamonds became celebrated later on in judicial accounts she was called mamselle miss the two little creatures who had fallen to magnon had no reason to complain of their lot recommended by the eighty francs they were well cared for as is everything
1336,from which profit is derived they were neither badly clothed nor badly fed they were treated almost like little gentlemen better by their false mother than by their real one magnon played the lady and talked no thieves slang in their presence thus passed several years thenardier augured well from the fact one day he chanced to say to magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend of ten francs the father must give them some education all at once these two poor children who had up to that time been protected tolerably well even by their evil fate were abruptly hurled into life and forced to begin it for themselves a wholesale arrest of malefactors like that in the jondrette garret necessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent incarcerations is a veritable disaster for that hideous and occult counter society which pursues its existence beneath public society an adventure of this description entails all sorts of catastrophes in that sombre world the thenardier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of magnon one day a short time after magnon had handed to eponine the note relating to the rue plumet a sudden raid was made by the police in the rue clocheperce magnon
1337,was seized as was also mamselle miss and all the inhabitants of the house which was of a suspicious character were gathered into the net while this was going on the two little boys were playing in the back yard and saw nothing of the raid when they tried to enter the house again they found the door fastened and the house empty a cobbler opposite called them to him and delivered to them a paper which their mother had left for them on this paper there was an address m barge collector of rents rue du roi de sicile no the proprietor of the stall said to them you cannot live here any longer go there it is near by the first street on the left ask your way from this paper the children set out the elder leading the younger and holding in his hand the paper which was to guide them it was cold and his benumbed little fingers could not close very firmly and they did not keep a very good hold on the paper at the corner of the rue clocheperce a gust of wind tore it from him and as night was falling the
1338,child was not able to find it again they began to wander aimlessly through the streets ii in which little gavroche extracts profit from napoleon the great spring in paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which do not precisely chill but freeze one these north winds which sadden the most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of cold air which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting door or window it seems as though the gloomy door of winter had remained ajar and as though the wind were pouring through it in the spring of the epoch when the first great epidemic of this century broke out in europe these north gales were more harsh and piercing than ever it was a door even more glacial than that of winter which was ajar it was the door of the sepulchre in these winds one felt the breath of the cholera from a meteorological point of view these cold winds possessed this peculiarity that they did not preclude a strong electric tension frequent storms accompanied by thunder and lightning burst forth at this epoch one evening when these gales were blowing
1339,rudely to such a degree that january seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed their cloaks little gavroche who was always shivering gayly under his rags was standing as though in ecstasy before a wig maker's shop in the vicinity of the orme saint gervais he was adorned with a woman's woollen shawl picked up no one knows where and which he had converted into a neck comforter little gavroche appeared to be engaged in intent admiration of a wax bride in a low necked dress and crowned with orange flowers who was revolving in the window and displaying her smile to passers by between two argand lamps but in reality he was taking an observation of the shop in order to discover whether he could not prig from the shop front a cake of soap which he would then proceed to sell for a sou to a hair dresser in the suburbs he had often managed to breakfast off of such a roll he called his species of work for which he possessed special aptitude shaving barbers while contemplating the bride and eyeing the cake of soap he muttered between his teeth tuesday it was not
1340,tuesday was it tuesday perhaps it was tuesday yes it was tuesday no one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred yes perchance this monologue had some connection with the last occasion on which he had dined three days before for it was now friday the barber in his shop which was warmed by a good stove was shaving a customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy that freezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his pockets but whose mind was evidently unsheathed while gavroche was scrutinizing the shop window and the cakes of windsor soap two children of unequal stature very neatly dressed and still smaller than himself one apparently about seven years of age the other five timidly turned the handle and entered the shop with a request for something or other alms possibly in a plaintive murmur which resembled a groan rather than a prayer they both spoke at once and their words were unintelligible because sobs broke the voice of the younger and the teeth of the elder were chattering with cold the barber wheeled round with a furious look and without abandoning his razor thrust
1341,back the elder with his left hand and the younger with his knee and slammed his door saying the idea of coming in and freezing everybody for nothing the two children resumed their march in tears in the meantime a cloud had risen it had begun to rain little gavroche ran after them and accosted them what's the matter with you brats we don't know where we are to sleep replied the elder is that all said gavroche a great matter truly the idea of bawling about that they must be greenies and adopting in addition to his superiority which was rather bantering an accent of tender authority and gentle patronage come along with me young uns yes sir said the elder and the two children followed him as they would have followed an archbishop they had stopped crying gavroche led them up the rue saint antoine in the direction of the bastille as gavroche walked along he cast an indignant backward glance at the barber's shop that fellow has no heart the whiting he muttered he's an englishman a woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file with gavroche at their head burst into noisy laughter
1342,this laugh was wanting in respect towards the group good day mamselle omnibus said gavroche to her an instant later the wig maker occurred to his mind once more and he added i am making a mistake in the beast he's not a whiting he's a serpent barber i'll go and fetch a locksmith and i'll have a bell hung to your tail this wig maker had rendered him aggressive as he strode over a gutter he apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet faust on the brocken and who had a broom in her hand madam said he so you are going out with your horse and thereupon he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian you scamp shouted the furious pedestrian gavroche elevated his nose above his shawl is monsieur complaining of you ejaculated the man the office is closed said gavroche i do not receive any more complaints in the meanwhile as he went on up the street he perceived a beggar girl thirteen or fourteen years old and clad in so short a gown that her knees were visible lying thoroughly chilled under a porte cochere the little girl was getting to be too
1343,old for such a thing growth does play these tricks the petticoat becomes short at the moment when nudity becomes indecent poor girl said gavroche she hasn't even trousers hold on take this and unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar girl where the scarf became a shawl once more the child stared at him in astonishment and received the shawl in silence when a certain stage of distress has been reached in his misery the poor man no longer groans over evil no longer returns thanks for good that done brrr said gavroche who was shivering more than saint martin for the latter retained one half of his cloak at this brrr the downpour of rain redoubled in its spite became furious the wicked skies punish good deeds ah come now exclaimed gavroche what's the meaning of this it's re raining good heavens if it goes on like this i shall stop my subscription and he set out on the march once more it's all right he resumed casting a glance at the beggar girl as she coiled up under the shawl she's
1344,got a famous peel and looking up at the clouds he exclaimed caught the two children followed close on his heels as they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices which indicate a baker's shop for bread is put behind bars like gold gavroche turned round ah by the way brats have we dined monsieur replied the elder we have had nothing to eat since this morning so you have neither father nor mother resumed gavroche majestically excuse us sir we have a papa and a mamma but we don't know where they are sometimes that's better than knowing where they are said gavroche who was a thinker we have been wandering about these two hours continued the elder we have hunted for things at the corners of the streets but we have found nothing i know ejaculated gavroche it's the dogs who eat everything he went on after a pause ah we have lost our authors we don't know what we have done with them this should not be gamins it's stupid to let old people stray off like that come now we must have a snooze all the same however he asked them no questions what was
1345,more simple than that they should have no dwelling place the elder of the two children who had almost entirely recovered the prompt heedlessness of childhood uttered this exclamation it's queer all the same mamma told us that she would take us to get a blessed spray on palm sunday bosh said gavroche mamma resumed the elder is a lady who lives with mamselle miss tanflute retorted gavroche meanwhile he had halted and for the last two minutes he had been feeling and fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained at last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied but which was triumphant in reality let us be calm young uns here's supper for three and from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou without allowing the two urchins time for amazement he pushed both of them before him into the baker's shop and flung his sou on the counter crying boy five centimes worth of bread the baker who was the proprietor in person took up a loaf and a knife in three pieces my boy went on gavroche and he added with dignity there are three of us
1346,and seeing that the baker after scrutinizing the three customers had taken down a black loaf he thrust his finger far up his nose with an inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great frederick's snuff on the tip of his thumb and hurled this indignant apostrophe full in the baker's face keksekca those of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this interpellation of gavroche's to the baker a russian or a polish word or one of those savage cries which the yoways and the botocudos hurl at each other from bank to bank of a river athwart the solitudes are warned that it is a word which they our readers utter every day and which takes the place of the phrase qu'est ce que c'est que cela the baker understood perfectly and replied well it's bread and very good bread of the second quality you mean larton brutal black bread retorted gavroche calmly and coldly disdainful white bread boy white bread larton savonne i'm standing treat the baker could not repress a smile and as he cut the white bread he surveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked gavroche come
1347,now baker's boy said he what are you taking our measure like that for all three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure when the bread was cut the baker threw the sou into his drawer and gavroche said to the two children grub away the little boys stared at him in surprise gavroche began to laugh ah hullo that's so they don't understand yet they're too small and he repeated eat away at the same time he held out a piece of bread to each of them and thinking that the elder who seemed to him the more worthy of his conversation deserved some special encouragement and ought to be relieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite he added as be handed him the largest share ram that into your muzzle one piece was smaller than the others he kept this for himself the poor children including gavroche were famished as they tore their bread apart in big mouthfuls they blocked up the shop of the baker who now that they had paid their money looked angrily at them let's go into the street again said gavroche they set off once more in
1348,the direction of the bastille from time to time as they passed the lighted shop windows the smallest halted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended from his neck by a cord well he is a very green un said gavroche then becoming thoughtful he muttered between his teeth all the same if i had charge of the babes i'd lock em up better than that just as they were finishing their morsel of bread and had reached the angle of that gloomy rue des ballets at the other end of which the low and threatening wicket of la force was visible hullo is that you gavroche said some one hullo is that you montparnasse said gavroche a man had just accosted the street urchin and the man was no other than montparnasse in disguise with blue spectacles but recognizable to gavroche the bow wows went on gavroche you've got a hide the color of a linseed plaster and blue specs like a doctor you're putting on style pon my word hush ejaculated montparnasse not so loud and he drew gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops the two little ones followed mechanically
1349,holding each other by the hand when they were ensconced under the arch of a portecochere sheltered from the rain and from all eyes do you know where i'm going demanded montparnasse to the abbey of ascend with regret replied gavroche joker and montparnasse went on i'm going to find babet ah exclaimed gavroche so her name is babet montparnasse lowered his voice not she he ah babet yes babet i thought he was buckled he has undone the buckle replied montparnasse and he rapidly related to the gamin how on the morning of that very day babet having been transferred to la conciergerie had made his escape by turning to the left instead of to the right in the police office gavroche expressed his admiration for this skill what a dentist he cried montparnasse added a few details as to babet's flight and ended with oh that's not all gavroche as he listened had seized a cane that montparnasse held in his hand and mechanically pulled at the upper part and the blade of a dagger made its appearance ah he exclaimed pushing the dagger back in haste you have brought along your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois montparnasse
1350,winked the deuce resumed gavroche so you're going to have a bout with the bobbies you can't tell replied montparnasse with an indifferent air it's always a good thing to have a pin about one gavroche persisted what are you up to to night again montparnasse took a grave tone and said mouthing every syllable things and abruptly changing the conversation by the way what something happened t'other day fancy i meet a bourgeois he makes me a present of a sermon and his purse i put it in my pocket a minute later i feel in my pocket there's nothing there except the sermon said gavroche but you went on montparnasse where are you bound for now gavroche pointed to his two proteges and said i'm going to put these infants to bed whereabouts is the bed at my house where's your house at my house so you have a lodging yes i have and where is your lodging in the elephant said gavroche montparnasse though not naturally inclined to astonishment could not restrain an exclamation in the elephant well yes in the elephant retorted gavroche kekcaa this is another word of the language which no one writes and
1351,which every one speaks kekcaa signifies quest que c'est que cela a what's the matter with that the urchin's profound remark recalled montparnasse to calmness and good sense he appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to gavroche's lodging of course said he yes the elephant is it comfortable there very said gavroche it's really bully there there ain't any draughts as there are under the bridges how do you get in oh i get in so there is a hole demanded montparnasse parbleu i should say so but you mustn't tell it's between the fore legs the bobbies haven't seen it and you climb up yes i understand a turn of the hand cric crac and it's all over no one there after a pause gavroche added i shall have a ladder for these children montparnasse burst out laughing where the devil did you pick up those young uns gavroche replied with great simplicity they are some brats that a wig maker made me a present of meanwhile montparnasse had fallen to thinking you recognized me very readily he muttered he took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than two quills wrapped in cotton
1352,and thrust one up each of his nostrils this gave him a different nose that changes you remarked gavroche you are less homely so you ought to keep them on all the time montparnasse was a handsome fellow but gavroche was a tease seriously demanded montparnasse how do you like me so the sound of his voice was different also in a twinkling montparnasse had become unrecognizable oh do play porrichinelle for us exclaimed gavroche the two children who had not been listening up to this point being occupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses drew near at this name and stared at montparnasse with dawning joy and admiration unfortunately montparnasse was troubled he laid his hand on gavroche's shoulder and said to him emphasizing his words listen to what i tell you boy if i were on the square with my dog my knife and my wife and if you were to squander ten sous on me i wouldn't refuse to work but this isn't shrove tuesday this odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin he wheeled round hastily darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profound attention and perceived a police sergeant standing
1353,with his back to them a few paces off gavroche allowed an ah good to escape him but immediately suppressed it and shaking montparnasse's hand well good evening said he i'm going off to my elephant with my brats supposing that you should need me some night you can come and hunt me up there i lodge on the entresol there is no porter you will inquire for monsieur gavroche very good said montparnasse and they parted montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of the greve and gavroche towards the bastille the little one of five dragged along by his brother who was dragged by gavroche turned his head back several times to watch porrichinelle as he went the ambiguous phrase by means of which montparnasse had warned gavroche of the presence of the policeman contained no other talisman than the assonance dig repeated five or six times in different forms this syllable dig uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words of a phrase means take care we can no longer talk freely there was besides in montparnasse's sentence a literary beauty which was lost upon gavroche that is mon dogue ma dague et ma digue a slang expression
1354,of the temple which signifies my dog my knife and my wife greatly in vogue among clowns and the red tails in the great century when moliere wrote and callot drew twenty years ago there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of the place de la bastille near the basin of the canal excavated in the ancient ditch of the fortress prison a singular monument which has already been effaced from the memories of parisians and which deserved to leave some trace for it was the idea of a member of the institute the general in chief of the army of egypt we say monument although it was only a rough model but this model itself a marvellous sketch the grandiose skeleton of an idea of napoleon's which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown on each occasion still further from us had become historical and had acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisional aspect it was an elephant forty feet high constructed of timber and masonry bearing on its back a tower which resembled a house formerly painted green by some dauber and now painted black by heaven the wind and time
1355,in this deserted and unprotected corner of the place the broad brow of the colossus his trunk his tusks his tower his enormous crupper his four feet like columns produced at night under the starry heavens a surprising and terrible form it was a sort of symbol of popular force it was sombre mysterious and immense it was some mighty visible phantom one knew not what standing erect beside the invisible spectre of the bastille few strangers visited this edifice no passer by looked at it it was falling into ruins every season the plaster which detached itself from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it the aediles as the expression ran in elegant dialect had forgotten it ever since there it stood in its corner melancholy sick crumbling surrounded by a rotten palisade soiled continually by drunken coachmen cracks meandered athwart its belly a lath projected from its tail tall grass flourished between its legs and as the level of the place had been rising all around it for a space of thirty years by that slow and continuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns it stood in a hollow and it looked as though the
1356,ground were giving way beneath it it was unclean despised repulsive and superb ugly in the eyes of the bourgeois melancholy in the eyes of the thinker there was something about it of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out and something of the majesty which is on the point of being decapitated as we have said at night its aspect changed night is the real element of everything that is dark as soon as twilight descended the old elephant became transfigured he assumed a tranquil and redoubtable appearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows being of the past he belonged to night and obscurity was in keeping with his grandeur this rough squat heavy hard austere almost misshapen but assuredly majestic monument stamped with a sort of magnificent and savage gravity has disappeared and left to reign in peace a sort of gigantic stove ornamented with its pipe which has replaced the sombre fortress with its nine towers very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal classes it is quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of an epoch in which a pot contains power this epoch will pass away people have
1357,already begun to understand that if there can be force in a boiler there can be no force except in the brain in other words that which leads and drags on the world is not locomotives but ideas harness locomotives to ideas that is well done but do not mistake the horse for the rider at all events to return to the place de la bastille the architect of this elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster the architect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out of bronze this stove pipe which has been baptized by a sonorous name and called the column of july this monument of a revolution that miscarried was still enveloped in in an immense shirt of woodwork which we regret for our part and by a vast plank enclosure which completed the task of isolating the elephant it was towards this corner of the place dimly lighted by the reflection of a distant street lamp that the gamin guided his two brats the reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind him that we are dealing with simple reality and that twenty years ago the
1358,tribunals were called upon to judge under the charge of vagabondage and mutilation of a public monument a child who had been caught asleep in this very elephant of the bastille this fact noted we proceed on arriving in the vicinity of the colossus gavroche comprehended the effect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small and said don't be scared infants then he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant's enclosure and helped the young ones to clamber through the breach the two children somewhat frightened followed gavroche without uttering a word and confided themselves to this little providence in rags which had given them bread and had promised them a shelter there extended along the fence lay a ladder which by day served the laborers in the neighboring timber yard gavroche raised it with remarkable vigor and placed it against one of the elephant's forelegs near the point where the ladder ended a sort of black hole in the belly of the colossus could be distinguished gavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests and said to them climb up and go in the two little boys exchanged terrified glances
1359,you're afraid brats exclaimed gavroche and he added you shall see he clasped the rough leg of the elephant and in a twinkling without deigning to make use of the ladder he had reached the aperture he entered it as an adder slips through a crevice and disappeared within and an instant later the two children saw his head which looked pale appear vaguely on the edge of the shadowy hole like a wan and whitish spectre well he exclaimed climb up young uns you'll see how snug it is here come up you he said to the elder i'll lend you a hand the little fellows nudged each other the gamin frightened and inspired them with confidence at one and the same time and then it was raining very hard the elder one undertook the risk the younger on seeing his brother climbing up and himself left alone between the paws of this huge beast felt greatly inclined to cry but he did not dare the elder lad climbed with uncertain steps up the rungs of the ladder gavroche in the meanwhile encouraging him with exclamations like a fencing master to his pupils or a muleteer to his mules
1360,don't be afraid that's it come on put your feet there give us your hand here boldly and when the child was within reach he seized him suddenly and vigorously by the arm and pulled him towards him nabbed said he the brat had passed through the crack now said gavroche wait for me be so good as to take a seat monsieur and making his way out of the hole as he had entered it he slipped down the elephant's leg with the agility of a monkey landed on his feet in the grass grasped the child of five round the body and planted him fairly in the middle of the ladder then he began to climb up behind him shouting to the elder i'm going to boost him do you tug and in another instant the small lad was pushed dragged pulled thrust stuffed into the hole before he had time to recover himself and gavroche entering behind him and repulsing the ladder with a kick which sent it flat on the grass began to clap his hands and to cry here we are long live general lafayette this explosion over he added now young uns you are
1361,in my house gavroche was at home in fact oh unforeseen utility of the useless charity of great things goodness of giants this huge monument which had embodied an idea of the emperor's had become the box of a street urchin the brat had been accepted and sheltered by the colossus the bourgeois decked out in their sunday finery who passed the elephant of the bastille were fond of saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes what's the good of that it served to save from the cold the frost the hail and rain to shelter from the winds of winter to preserve from slumber in the mud which produces fever and from slumber in the snow which produces death a little being who had no father no mother no bread no clothes no refuge it served to receive the innocent whom society repulsed it served to diminish public crime it was a lair open to one against whom all doors were shut it seemed as though the miserable old mastodon invaded by vermin and oblivion covered with warts with mould and ulcers tottering worm eaten abandoned condemned a sort of mendicant colossus asking alms in vain
1362,with a benevolent look in the midst of the cross roads had taken pity on that other mendicant the poor pygmy who roamed without shoes to his feet without a roof over his head blowing on his fingers clad in rags fed on rejected scraps that was what the elephant of the bastille was good for this idea of napoleon disdained by men had been taken back by god that which had been merely illustrious had become august in order to realize his thought the emperor should have had porphyry brass iron gold marble the old collection of planks beams and plaster sufficed for god the emperor had had the dream of a genius in that titanic elephant armed prodigious with trunk uplifted bearing its tower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying waters he wished to incarnate the people god had done a grander thing with it he had lodged a child there the hole through which gavroche had entered was a breach which was hardly visible from the outside being concealed as we have stated beneath the elephant's belly and so narrow that it was only cats and homeless children who could pass through it let's
1363,begin said gavroche by telling the porter that we are not at home and plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is well acquainted with his apartments he took a plank and stopped up the aperture again gavroche plunged into the obscurity the children heard the crackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle the chemical match was not yet in existence at that epoch the fumade steel represented progress a sudden light made them blink gavroche had just managed to ignite one of those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called cellar rats the cellar rat which emitted more smoke than light rendered the interior of the elephant confusedly visible gavroche's two guests glanced about them and the sensation which they experienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up in the great tun of heidelberg or better still like what jonah must have felt in the biblical belly of the whale an entire and gigantic skeleton appeared enveloping them above a long brown beam whence started at regular distances massive arching ribs represented the vertebral column with its sides stalactites of plaster depended from them like entrails and
1364,vast spiders webs stretching from side to side formed dirty diaphragms here and there in the corners were visible large blackish spots which had the appearance of being alive and which changed places rapidly with an abrupt and frightened movement fragments which had fallen from the elephant's back into his belly had filled up the cavity so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a floor the smaller child nestled up against his brother and whispered to him it's black this remark drew an exclamation from gavroche the petrified air of the two brats rendered some shock necessary what's that you are gabbling about there he exclaimed are you scoffing at me are you turning up your noses do you want the tuileries are you brutes come say i warn you that i don't belong to the regiment of simpletons ah come now are you brats from the pope's establishment a little roughness is good in cases of fear it is reassuring the two children drew close to gavroche gavroche paternally touched by this confidence passed from grave to gentle and addressing the smaller stupid said he accenting the insulting word with a caressing intonation it's outside
1365,that it is black outside it's raining here it does not rain outside it's cold here there's not an atom of wind outside there are heaps of people here there's no one outside there ain't even the moon here there's my candle confound it the two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror but gavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation quick said he and he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the end of the room there stood his bed gavroche's bed was complete that is to say it had a mattress a blanket and an alcove with curtains the mattress was a straw mat the blanket a rather large strip of gray woollen stuff very warm and almost new this is what the alcove consisted of three rather long poles thrust into and consolidated with the rubbish which formed the floor that is to say the belly of the elephant two in front and one behind and united by a rope at their summits so as to form a pyramidal bundle this cluster supported a trellis work of brass wire which was simply placed upon it but
1366,artistically applied and held by fastenings of iron wire so that it enveloped all three holes a row of very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothing could pass under it this grating was nothing else than a piece of the brass screens with which aviaries are covered in menageries gavroche's bed stood as in a cage behind this net the whole resembled an esquimaux tent this trellis work took the place of curtains gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart down on all fours brats said gavroche he made his guests enter the cage with great precaution then he crawled in after them pulled the stones together and closed the opening hermetically again all three had stretched out on the mat gavroche still had the cellar rat in his hand now said he go to sleep i'm going to suppress the candelabra monsieur the elder of the brothers asked gavroche pointing to the netting what's that for that answered gavroche gravely is for the rats go to sleep nevertheless he felt obliged to add a
1367,few words of instruction for the benefit of these young creatures and he continued it's a thing from the jardin des plantes it's used for fierce animals there's a whole shopful of them there all you've got to do is to climb over a wall crawl through a window and pass through a door you can get as much as you want as he spoke he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of the blanket and the little one murmured oh how good that is it's warm gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket that's from the jardin des plantes too said he i took that from the monkeys and pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying a very thick and admirably made mat he added that belonged to the giraffe after a pause he went on the beasts had all these things i took them away from them it didn't trouble them i told them it's for the elephant he paused and then resumed you crawl over the walls and you don't care a straw for the government so there now the two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect
1368,on this intrepid and ingenious being a vagabond like themselves isolated like themselves frail like themselves who had something admirable and all powerful about him who seemed supernatural to them and whose physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank mingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles monsieur ventured the elder timidly you are not afraid of the police then gavroche contented himself with replying brat nobody says police they say bobbies the smaller had his eyes wide open but he said nothing as he was on the edge of the mat the elder being in the middle gavroche tucked the blanket round him as a mother might have done and heightened the mat under his head with old rags in such a way as to form a pillow for the child then he turned to the elder hey we're jolly comfortable here ain't we ah yes replied the elder gazing at gavroche with the expression of a saved angel the two poor little children who had been soaked through began to grow warm once more ah by the way continued gavroche what were you bawling about and pointing out the little one to his brother
1369,a mite like that i've nothing to say about but the idea of a big fellow like you crying it's idiotic you looked like a calf gracious replied the child we have no lodging bother retorted gavroche you don't say lodgings you say crib and then we were afraid of being alone like that at night you don't say night you say darkmans thank you sir said the child listen went on gavroche you must never bawl again over anything i'll take care of you you shall see what fun we'll have in summer we'll go to the glaciere with navet one of my pals we'll bathe in the gare we'll run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at austerlitz that makes the laundresses raging they scream they get mad and if you only knew how ridiculous they are we'll go and see the man skeleton and then i'll take you to the play i'll take you to see frederick lemaitre i have tickets i know some of the actors i even played in a piece once there were a lot of us fellers and we ran under a cloth and that made the sea i'll
1370,get you an engagement at my theatre we'll go to see the savages they ain't real those savages ain't they wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles and you can see where their elbows have been darned with white then we'll go to the opera we'll get in with the hired applauders the opera claque is well managed i wouldn't associate with the claque on the boulevard at the opera just fancy some of them pay twenty sous but they're ninnies they're called dishclouts and then we'll go to see the guillotine work i'll show you the executioner he lives in the rue des marais monsieur sanson he has a letter box at his door ah we'll have famous fun at that moment a drop of wax fell on gavroche's finger and recalled him to the realities of life the deuce said he there's the wick giving out attention i can't spend more than a sou a month on my lighting when a body goes to bed he must sleep we haven't the time to read m paul de kock's romances and besides the light might pass through the cracks of the porte cochere and all the bobbies need
1371,to do is to see it and then remarked the elder timidly he alone dared talk to gavroche and reply to him a spark might fall in the straw and we must look out and not burn the house down people don't say burn the house down remarked gavroche they say blaze the crib the storm increased in violence and the heavy downpour beat upon the back of the colossus amid claps of thunder you're taken in rain said gavroche it amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of the house winter is a stupid it wastes its merchandise it loses its labor it can't wet us and that makes it kick up a row old water carrier that it is this allusion to the thunder all the consequences of which gavroche in his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century accepted was followed by a broad flash of lightning so dazzling that a hint of it entered the belly of the elephant through the crack almost at the same instant the thunder rumbled with great fury the two little creatures uttered a shriek and started up so eagerly that the network came near being displaced
1372,but gavroche turned his bold face to them and took advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh calm down children don't topple over the edifice that's fine first class thunder all right that's no slouch of a streak of lightning bravo for the good god deuce take it it's almost as good as it is at the ambigu that said he restored order in the netting pushed the two children gently down on the bed pressed their knees in order to stretch them out at full length and exclaimed since the good god is lighting his candle i can blow out mine now babes now my young humans you must shut your peepers it's very bad not to sleep it'll make you swallow the strainer or as they say in fashionable society stink in the gullet wrap yourself up well in the hide i'm going to put out the light are you ready yes murmured the elder i'm all right i seem to have feathers under my head people don't say head cried gavroche they say nut the two children nestled close to each other gavroche finished arranging them on the mat drew the blanket up
1373,to their very ears then repeated for the third time his injunction in the hieratical tongue shut your peepers and he snuffed out his tiny light hardly had the light been extinguished when a peculiar trembling began to affect the netting under which the three children lay it consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic sound as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire this was accompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries the little five year old boy on hearing this hubbub overhead and chilled with terror jogged his brother's elbow but the elder brother had already shut his peepers as gavroche had ordered then the little one who could no longer control his terror questioned gavroche but in a very low tone and with bated breath sir hey said gavroche who had just closed his eyes what is that it's the rats replied gavroche and he laid his head down on the mat again the rats in fact who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the elephant and who were the living black spots which we have already mentioned had been held in awe by the flame of the
1374,candle so long as it had been lighted but as soon as the cavern which was the same as their city had returned to darkness scenting what the good story teller perrault calls fresh meat they had hurled themselves in throngs on gavroche's tent had climbed to the top of it and had begun to bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this new fangled trap still the little one could not sleep sir he began again hey said gavroche what are rats they are mice this explanation reassured the child a little he had seen white mice in the course of his life and he was not afraid of them nevertheless he lifted up his voice once more sir hey said gavroche again why don't you have a cat i did have one replied gavroche i brought one here but they ate her this second explanation undid the work of the first and the little fellow began to tremble again the dialogue between him and gavroche began again for the fourth time monsieur hey who was it that was eaten the cat and who ate the cat the rats the mice yes the rats the child in consternation
1375,dismayed at the thought of mice which ate cats pursued sir would those mice eat us wouldn't they just ejaculated gavroche the child's terror had reached its climax but gavroche added don't be afraid they can't get in and besides i'm here here catch hold of my hand hold your tongue and shut your peepers at the same time gavroche grasped the little fellow's hand across his brother the child pressed the hand close to him and felt reassured courage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicating themselves silence reigned round them once more the sound of their voices had frightened off the rats at the expiration of a few minutes they came raging back but in vain the three little fellows were fast asleep and heard nothing more the hours of the night fled away darkness covered the vast place de la bastille a wintry gale which mingled with the rain blew in gusts the patrol searched all the doorways alleys enclosures and obscure nooks and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence before the elephant the monster erect motionless staring open eyed into the shadows had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good
1376,deed and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleeping children in order to understand what is about to follow the reader must remember that at that epoch the bastille guard house was situated at the other end of the square and that what took place in the vicinity of the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn a man turned from the rue saint antoine at a run made the circuit of the enclosure of the column of july and glided between the palings until he was underneath the belly of the elephant if any light had illuminated that man it might have been divined from the thorough manner in which he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain arrived beneath the elephant he uttered a peculiar cry which did not belong to any human tongue and which a paroquet alone could have imitated twice he repeated this cry of whose orthography the following barely conveys an idea kirikikiou at the second cry a clear young merry voice responded from the belly of the elephant yes almost immediately the
1377,plank which closed the hole was drawn aside and gave passage to a child who descended the elephant's leg and fell briskly near the man it was gavroche the man was montparnasse as for his cry of kirikikiou that was doubtless what the child had meant when he said you will ask for monsieur gavroche on hearing it he had waked with a start had crawled out of his alcove pushing apart the netting a little and carefully drawing it together again then he had opened the trap and descended the man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom montparnasse confined himself to the remark we need you come lend us a hand the lad asked for no further enlightenment i'm with you said he and both took their way towards the rue saint antoine whence montparnasse had emerged winding rapidly through the long file of market gardeners carts which descend towards the markets at that hour the market gardeners crouching half asleep in their wagons amid the salads and vegetables enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflers on account of the beating rain did not even glance at these strange pedestrians iii the vicissitudes of
1378,flight this is what had taken place that same night at the la force an escape had been planned between babet brujon guelemer and thenardier although thenardier was in close confinement babet had arranged the matter for his own benefit on the same day as the reader has seen from montparnasse's account to gavroche montparnasse was to help them from outside brujon after having passed a month in the punishment cell had had time in the first place to weave a rope in the second to mature a plan in former times those severe places where the discipline of the prison delivers the convict into his own hands were composed of four stone walls a stone ceiling a flagged pavement a camp bed a grated window and a door lined with iron and were called dungeons but the dungeon was judged to be too terrible nowadays they are composed of an iron door a grated window a camp bed a flagged pavement four stone walls and a stone ceiling and are called chambers of punishment a little light penetrates towards mid day the inconvenient point about these chambers which as the reader sees are not dungeons is that they allow
1379,the persons who should be at work to think so brujon meditated and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with a rope as he had the name of being very dangerous in the charlemagne courtyard he was placed in the new building the first thing he found in the new building was guelemer the second was a nail guelemer that is to say crime a nail that is to say liberty brujon of whom it is high time that the reader should have a complete idea was with an appearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor a polished intelligent sprig and a thief who had a caressing glance and an atrocious smile his glance resulted from his will and his smile from his nature his first studies in his art had been directed to roofs he had made great progress in the industry of the men who tear off lead who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the process called double pickings the circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly favorable for an attempt at escape was that the roofers were re laying and re jointing at that very moment a portion
1380,of the slates on the prison the saint bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated from the charlemagne and the saint louis courts up above there were scaffoldings and ladders in other words bridges and stairs in the direction of liberty the new building which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be seen anywhere in the world was the weak point in the prison the walls were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on the prisoners in their beds in spite of this antiquity the authorities committed the error of confining in the new building the most troublesome prisoners of placing there the hard cases as they say in prison parlance the new building contained four dormitories one above the other and a top story which was called the bel air fine air a large chimney flue probably from some ancient kitchen of the dukes de la force started from the groundfloor traversed all four stories cut the dormitories where it figured as a flattened pillar into two
1381,portions and finally pierced the roof guelemer and brujon were in the same dormitory they had been placed by way of precaution on the lower story chance ordained that the heads of their beds should rest against the chimney thenardier was directly over their heads in the top story known as fine air the pedestrian who halts on the rue culture sainte catherine after passing the barracks of the firemen in front of the porte cochere of the bathing establishment beholds a yard full of flowers and shrubs in wooden boxes at the extremity of which spreads out a little white rotunda with two wings brightened up with green shutters the bucolic dream of jean jacques not more than ten years ago there rose above that rotunda an enormous black hideous bare wall by which it was backed up this was the outer wall of la force this wall beside that rotunda was milton viewed through berquin lofty as it was this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof which could be seen beyond this was the roof of the new building there one could descry four dormer windows guarded with bars they were the windows of the fine
1382,air a chimney pierced the roof this was the chimney which traversed the dormitories the bel air that top story of the new building was a sort of large hall with a mansard roof guarded with triple gratings and double doors of sheet iron which were studded with enormous bolts when one entered from the north end one had on one's left the four dormer windows on one's right facing the windows at regular intervals four square tolerably vast cages separated by narrow passages built of masonry to about the height of the elbow and the rest up to the roof of iron bars thenardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since the night of the d of february no one was ever able to discover how and by what connivance he succeeded in procuring and secreting a bottle of wine invented so it is said by desrues with which a narcotic is mixed and which the band of the endormeurs or sleep compellers rendered famous there are in many prisons treacherous employees half jailers half thieves who assist in escapes who sell to the police an unfaithful service and who turn a penny whenever they
1383,can on that same night then when little gavroche picked up the two lost children brujon and guelemer who knew that babet who had escaped that morning was waiting for them in the street as well as montparnasse rose softly and with the nail which brujon had found began to pierce the chimney against which their beds stood the rubbish fell on brujon's bed so that they were not heard showers mingled with thunder shook the doors on their hinges and created in the prison a terrible and opportune uproar those of the prisoners who woke pretended to fall asleep again and left guelemer and brujon to their own devices brujon was adroit guelemer was vigorous before any sound had reached the watcher who was sleeping in the grated cell which opened into the dormitory the wall had been pierced the chimney scaled the iron grating which barred the upper orifice of the flue forced and the two redoubtable ruffians were on the roof the wind and rain redoubled the roof was slippery what a good night to leg it said brujon an abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from the surrounding wall at the bottom
1384,of this abyss they could see the musket of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom they fastened one end of the rope which brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron bars which they had just wrenched off flung the other over the outer wall crossed the abyss at one bound clung to the coping of the wall got astride of it let themselves slip one after the other along the rope upon a little roof which touches the bath house pulled their rope after them jumped down into the courtyard of the bath house traversed it pushed open the porter's wicket beside which hung his rope pulled this opened the porte cochere and found themselves in the street three quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed in the dark nail in hand and their project in their heads a few moments later they had joined babet and montparnasse who were prowling about the neighborhood they had broken their rope in pulling it after them and a bit of it remained attached to the chimney on the roof they had sustained no other damage however than that of scratching nearly
1385,all the skin off their hands that night thenardier was warned without any one being able to explain how and was not asleep towards one o'clock in the morning the night being very dark he saw two shadows pass along the roof in the rain and squalls in front of the dormer window which was opposite his cage one halted at the window long enough to dart in a glance this was brujon thenardier recognized him and understood this was enough thenardier rated as a burglar and detained as a measure of precaution under the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush with armed force was kept in sight the sentry who was relieved every two hours marched up and down in front of his cage with loaded musket the fine air was lighted by a skylight the prisoner had on his feet fetters weighing fifty pounds every day at four o'clock in the afternoon a jailer escorted by two dogs this was still in vogue at that time entered his cage deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing two pounds a jug of water a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon in which swam a few mayagan
1386,beans inspected his irons and tapped the bars this man and his dogs made two visits during the night thenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall in order to preserve it from the rats as he said as thenardier was kept in sight no objection had been made to this spike still it was remembered afterwards that one of the jailers had said it would be better to let him have only a wooden spike at two o'clock in the morning the sentinel who was an old soldier was relieved and replaced by a conscript a few moments later the man with the dogs paid his visit and went off without noticing anything except possibly the excessive youth and the rustic air of the raw recruit two hours afterwards at four o'clock when they came to relieve the conscript he was found asleep on the floor lying like a log near thenardier's cage as for thenardier he was no longer there there was a hole in the ceiling of his cage and above it another hole in the roof one of the planks
1387,of his bed had been wrenched off and probably carried away with him as it was not found they also seized in his cell a half empty bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying wine with which the soldier had been drugged the soldier's bayonet had disappeared at the moment when this discovery was made it was assumed that thenardier was out of reach the truth is that he was no longer in the new building but that he was still in great danger thenardier on reaching the roof of the new building had found the remains of brujon's rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the chimney but as this broken fragment was much too short he had not been able to escape by the outer wall as brujon and guelemer had done when one turns from the rue des ballets into the rue du roi de sicile one almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin there stood on that spot in the last century a house of which only the back wall now remains a regular wall of masonry which rises to the height of the third story between the adjoining buildings this ruin can
1388,be recognized by two large square windows which are still to be seen there the middle one that nearest the right gable is barred with a worm eaten beam adjusted like a prop through these windows there was formerly visible a lofty and lugubrious wall which was a fragment of the outer wall of la force the empty space on the street left by the demolished house is half filled by a fence of rotten boards shored up by five stone posts in this recess lies concealed a little shanty which leans against the portion of the ruin which has remained standing the fence has a gate which a few years ago was fastened only by a latch it was the crest of this ruin that thenardier had succeeded in reaching a little after one o'clock in the morning how had he got there that is what no one has ever been able to explain or understand the lightning must at the same time have hindered and helped him had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the slaters to get from roof to roof from enclosure to enclosure from compartment to compartment to the buildings of the
1389,charlemagne court then to the buildings of the saint louis court to the outer wall and thence to the hut on the rue du roi de sicile but in that itinerary there existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility had he placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the fine air to the outer wall and crawled flat on his belly on the coping of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut but the outer wall of la force formed a crenellated and unequal line it mounted and descended it dropped at the firemen's barracks it rose towards the bath house it was cut in twain by buildings it was not even of the same height on the hotel lamoignon as on the rue pavee everywhere occurred falls and right angles and then the sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive hence the route taken by thenardier still remains rather inexplicable in two manners flight was impossible had thenardier spurred on by that thirst for liberty which changes precipices into ditches iron bars into wattles of osier a legless man into an
1390,athlete a gouty man into a bird stupidity into instinct instinct into intelligence and intelligence into genius had thenardier invented a third mode no one has ever found out the marvels of escape cannot always be accounted for the man who makes his escape we repeat is inspired there is something of the star and of the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight the effort towards deliverance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime and one says of the escaped thief how did he contrive to scale that wall in the same way that one says of corneille where did he find the means of dying at all events dripping with perspiration drenched with rain with his clothes hanging in ribbons his hands flayed his elbows bleeding his knees torn thenardier had reached what children in their figurative language call the edge of the wall of the ruin there he had stretched himself out at full length and there his strength had failed him a steep escarpment three stories high separated him from the pavement of the street the rope which he had was too short there he waited pale exhausted desperate with all the despair
1391,which he had undergone still hidden by the night but telling himself that the day was on the point of dawning alarmed at the idea of hearing the neighboring clock of saint paul strike four within a few minutes an hour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found asleep under the pierced roof staring in horror at a terrible depth at the light of the street lanterns the wet black pavement that pavement longed for yet frightful which meant death and which meant liberty he asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded if they had heard him and if they would come to his assistance he listened with the exception of the patrol no one had passed through the street since he had been there nearly the whole of the descent of the market gardeners from montreuil from charonne from vincennes and from bercy to the markets was accomplished through the rue saint antoine four o'clock struck thenardier shuddered a few moments later that terrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape broke forth in the prison the sound of doors opening and shutting the creaking of gratings on
1392,their hinges a tumult in the guard house the hoarse shouts of the turnkeys the shock of musket butts on the pavement of the courts reached his ears lights ascended and descended past the grated windows of the dormitories a torch ran along the ridge pole of the top story of the new building the firemen belonging in the barracks on the right had been summoned their helmets which the torch lighted up in the rain went and came along the roofs at the same time thenardier perceived in the direction of the bastille a wan whiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise he was on top of a wall ten inches wide stretched out under the heavy rains with two gulfs to right and left unable to stir subject to the giddiness of a possible fall and to the horror of a certain arrest and his thoughts like the pendulum of a clock swung from one of these ideas to the other dead if i fall caught if i stay in the midst of this anguish he suddenly saw the street being still dark a man who was gliding along the walls and coming from
1393,the rue pavee halt in the recess above which thenardier was as it were suspended here this man was joined by a second who walked with the same caution then by a third then by a fourth when these men were re united one of them lifted the latch of the gate in the fence and all four entered the enclosure in which the shanty stood they halted directly under thenardier these men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order that they might consult without being seen by the passers by or by the sentinel who guards the wicket of la force a few paces distant it must be added that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box thenardier not being able to distinguish their visages lent an ear to their words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself lost thenardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before his eyes these men conversed in slang the first said in a low but distinct voice let's cut what are we up to here the second replied it's raining hard enough to put out the very devil's fire and the bobbies will be along
1394,instanter there's a soldier on guard yonder we shall get nabbed here these two words icigo and icicaille both of which mean ici and which belong the first to the slang of the barriers the second to the slang of the temple were flashes of light for thenardier by the icigo he recognized brujon who was a prowler of the barriers by the icicaille he knew babet who among his other trades had been an old clothes broker at the temple the antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in the temple and babet was really the only person who spoke it in all its purity had it not been for the icicaille thenardier would not have recognized him for he had entirely changed his voice in the meanwhile the third man had intervened there's no hurry yet let's wait a bit how do we know that he doesn't stand in need of us by this which was nothing but french thenardier recognized montparnasse who made it a point in his elegance to understand all slangs and to speak none of them as for the fourth he held his peace but his huge shoulders betrayed him
1395,thenardier did not hesitate it was guelemer brujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone what are you jabbering about the tavern keeper hasn't managed to cut his stick he don't tumble to the racket that he don't you have to be a pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt cut up your sheet to make a rope punch holes in doors get up false papers make false keys file your irons hang out your cord hide yourself and disguise yourself the old fellow hasn't managed to play it he doesn't understand how to work the business babet added still in that classical slang which was spoken by poulailler and cartouche and which is to the bold new highly colored and risky argot used by brujon what the language of racine is to the language of andre chenier your tavern keeper must have been nabbed in the act you have to be knowing he's only a greenhorn he must have let himself be taken in by a bobby perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as his pal listen montparnasse do you hear those shouts in the prison you have seen all those lights
1396,he's recaptured there he'll get off with twenty years i ain't afraid i ain't a coward but there ain't anything more to do or otherwise they'd lead us a dance don't get mad come with us let's go drink a bottle of old wine together one doesn't desert one's friends in a scrape grumbled montparnasse i tell you he's nabbed retorted brujon at the present moment the inn keeper ain't worth a ha'penny we can't do nothing for him let's be off every minute i think a bobby has got me in his fist montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance the fact is that these four men with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon each other had prowled all night long about la force great as was their peril in the hope of seeing thenardier make his appearance on the top of some wall but the night which was really growing too fine for the downpour was such as to render all the streets deserted the cold which was overpowering them their soaked garments their hole ridden shoes the alarming noise which had just burst forth in the prison the hours which had elapsed the patrol
1397,which they had encountered the hope which was vanishing all urged them to beat a retreat montparnasse himself who was perhaps almost thenardier's son in law yielded a moment more and they would be gone thenardier was panting on his wall like the shipwrecked sufferers of the meduse on their raft when they beheld the vessel which had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon he dared not call to them a cry might be heard and ruin everything an idea occurred to him a last idea a flash of inspiration he drew from his pocket the end of brujon's rope which he had detached from the chimney of the new building and flung it into the space enclosed by the fence this rope fell at their feet a widow said babet my tortouse said brujon the tavern keeper is there said montparnasse they raised their eyes thenardier thrust out his head a very little quick said montparnasse have you the other end of the rope brujon yes knot the two pieces together we'll fling him the rope he can fasten it to the wall and he'll have enough of it to get down with thenardier ran the risk and
1398,spoke i am paralyzed with cold we'll warm you up i can't budge let yourself slide we'll catch you my hands are benumbed only fasten the rope to the wall i can't then one of us must climb up said montparnasse three stories ejaculated brujon an ancient plaster flue which had served for a stove that had been used in the shanty in former times ran along the wall and mounted almost to the very spot where they could see thenardier this flue then much damaged and full of cracks has since fallen but the marks of it are still visible it was very narrow one might get up by the help of that said montparnasse by that flue exclaimed babet a grown up cove never it would take a brat a brat must be got resumed brujon where are we to find a young un said guelemer wait said montparnasse i've got the very article he opened the gate of the fence very softly made sure that no one was passing along the street stepped out cautiously shut the gate behind him and set off at a run in the direction of the bastille seven or eight minutes elapsed
1399,eight thousand centuries to thenardier babet brujon and guelemer did not open their lips at last the gate opened once more and montparnasse appeared breathless and followed by gavroche the rain still rendered the street completely deserted little gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these ruffians with a tranquil air the water was dripping from his hair guelemer addressed him are you a man young un gavroche shrugged his shoulders and replied a young un like me's a man and men like you are babes the brat's tongue's well hung exclaimed babet the paris brat ain't made of straw added brujon what do you want asked gavroche montparnasse answered climb up that flue with this rope said babet and fasten it continued brujon to the top of the wall went on babet to the cross bar of the window added brujon and then said gavroche there said guelemer the gamin examined the rope the flue the wall the windows and made that indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies is that all there's a man up there whom you are to save resumed montparnasse will you began brujon again greenhorn replied the lad as
1400,though the question appeared a most unprecedented one to him and he took off his shoes guelemer seized gavroche by one arm set him on the roof of the shanty whose worm eaten planks bent beneath the urchin's weight and handed him the rope which brujon had knotted together during montparnasse's absence the gamin directed his steps towards the flue which it was easy to enter thanks to a large crack which touched the roof at the moment when he was on the point of ascending thenardier who saw life and safety approaching bent over the edge of the wall the first light of dawn struck white upon his brow dripping with sweat upon his livid cheek bones his sharp and savage nose his bristling gray beard and gavroche recognized him hullo it's my father oh that won't hinder and taking the rope in his teeth he resolutely began the ascent he reached the summit of the hut bestrode the old wall as though it had been a horse and knotted the rope firmly to the upper cross bar of the window a moment later thenardier was in the street as soon as he touched the pavement as soon as
1401,he found himself out of danger he was no longer either weary or chilled or trembling the terrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke all that strange and ferocious mind awoke once more and stood erect and free ready to march onward these were this man's first words now whom are we to eat it is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent remark which signifies both to kill to assassinate and to plunder to eat true sense to devour let's get well into a corner said brujon let's settle it in three words and part at once there was an affair that promised well in the rue plumet a deserted street an isolated house an old rotten gate on a garden and lone women well why not demanded thenardier your girl eponine went to see about the matter replied babet and she brought a biscuit to magnon added guelemer nothing to be made there the girl's no fool said thenardier still it must be seen to yes yes said brujon it must be looked up in the meanwhile none of the men seemed to see gavroche who during this colloquy had seated himself on
1402,one of the fence posts he waited a few moments thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him then he put on his shoes again and said is that all you don't want any more my men now you're out of your scrape i'm off i must go and get my brats out of bed and off he went the five men emerged one after another from the enclosure when gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the rue des ballets babet took thenardier aside did you take a good look at that young un he asked what young un the one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope not particularly well i don't know but it strikes me that it was your son bah said thenardier do you think so seventh slang i origin pigritia is a terrible word it engenders a whole world la pegre for which read theft and a hell la pegrenne for which read hunger thus idleness is the mother she has a son theft and a daughter hunger where are we at this moment in the land of slang what is slang it is at one and the same time a
1403,nation and a dialect it is theft in its two kinds people and language when four and thirty years ago the narrator of this grave and sombre history introduced into a work written with the same aim as this a thief who talked argot there arose amazement and clamor what how argot why argot is horrible it is the language of prisons galleys convicts of everything that is most abominable in society etc etc we have never understood this sort of objections since that time two powerful romancers one of whom is a profound observer of the human heart the other an intrepid friend of the people balzac and eugene sue having represented their ruffians as talking their natural language as the author of the last day of a condemned man did in the same objections have been raised people repeated what do authors mean by that revolting dialect slang is odious slang makes one shudder who denies that of course it does when it is a question of probing a wound a gulf a society since when has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom we have always thought that it was sometimes
1404,a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and fulfilled merits why should one not explore everything and study everything why should one halt on the way the halt is a matter depending on the sounding line and not on the leadsman certainly too it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to undertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order where terra firma comes to an end and where mud begins to rummage in those vague murky waves to follow up to seize and to fling still quivering upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with filth when thus brought to the light that pustulous vocabulary each word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the shadows nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang it seems in fact to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool one thinks one beholds a frightful living and bristling thicket which quivers rustles
1405,wavers returns to shadow threatens and glares one word resembles a claw another an extinguished and bleeding eye such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab all this is alive with the hideous vitality of things which have been organized out of disorganization now when has horror ever excluded study since when has malady banished medicine can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper the bat the scorpion the centipede the tarantula and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying oh how ugly that is the thinker who should turn aside from slang would resemble a surgeon who should avert his face from an ulcer or a wart he would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity for it must be stated to those who are ignorant of the case that argot is both a literary phenomenon and a social result what is slang properly speaking it is the language of wretchedness we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating it we may be
1406,told that all trades professions it may be added all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence have their own slang the merchant who says montpellier not active marseilles fine quality the broker on change who says assets at end of current month the gambler who says tiers et tout refait de pique the sheriff of the norman isles who says the holder in fee reverting to his landed estate cannot claim the fruits of that estate during the hereditary seizure of the real estate by the mortgagor the playwright who says the piece was hissed the comedian who says i've made a hit the philosopher who says phenomenal triplicity the huntsman who says voileci allais voileci fuyant the phrenologist who says amativeness combativeness secretiveness the infantry soldier who says my shooting iron the cavalry man who says my turkey cock the fencing master who says tierce quarte break the printer who says my shooting stick and galley all printer fencing master cavalry dragoon infantry man phrenologist huntsman philosopher comedian playwright sheriff gambler stock broker and merchant speak slang the painter who says my grinder the notary who says my skip the gutter the hairdresser who
1407,says my mealyback the cobbler who says my cub talks slang strictly speaking if one absolutely insists on the point all the different fashions of saying the right and the left the sailor's port and starboard the scene shifter's court side and garden side the beadle's gospel side and epistle side are slang there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the precieuses the hotel rambouillet nearly adjoins the cour des miracles there is a slang of duchesses witness this phrase contained in a love letter from a very great lady and a very pretty woman of the restoration you will find in this gossip a fultitude of reasons why i should libertize diplomatic ciphers are slang the pontifical chancellery by using for rome grkztntgzyal for despatch and abfxustgrnogrkzu tu xi for the due de modena speaks slang the physicians of the middle ages who for carrot radish and turnip said opoponach perfroschinum reptitalmus dracatholicum angelorum postmegorum talked slang the sugar manufacturer who says loaf clarified lumps bastard common burnt this honest manufacturer talks slang a certain school of criticism twenty years ago which used to say half of the works of shakespeare consists of plays
1408,upon words and puns talked slang the poet and the artist who with profound understanding would designate m de montmorency as a bourgeois if he were not a judge of verses and statues speak slang the classic academician who calls flowers flora fruits pomona the sea neptune love fires beauty charms a horse a courser the white or tricolored cockade the rose of bellona the three cornered hat mars triangle that classical academician talks slang algebra medicine botany have each their slang the tongue which is employed on board ship that wonderful language of the sea which is so complete and so picturesque which was spoken by jean bart duquesne suffren and duperre which mingles with the whistling of the rigging the sound of the speaking trumpets the shock of the boarding irons the roll of the sea the wind the gale the cannon is wholly a heroic and dazzling slang which is to the fierce slang of the thieves what the lion is to the jackal no doubt but say what we will this manner of understanding the word slang is an extension which every one will not admit for our part we reserve to the word its ancient
1409,and precise circumscribed and determined significance and we restrict slang to slang the veritable slang and the slang that is pre eminently slang if the two words can be coupled thus the slang immemorial which was a kingdom is nothing else we repeat than the homely uneasy crafty treacherous venomous cruel equivocal vile profound fatal tongue of wretchedness there exists at the extremity of all abasement and all misfortunes a last misery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into conflict with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights a fearful conflict where now cunning now violent unhealthy and ferocious at one and the same time it attacks the social order with pin pricks through vice and with club blows through crime to meet the needs of this conflict wretchedness has invented a language of combat which is slang to keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the gulf were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of which civilization is composed or by which it is complicated to extend the records
1410,of social observation is to serve civilization itself this service plautus rendered consciously or unconsciously by making two carthaginian soldiers talk phoenician that service moliere rendered by making so many of his characters talk levantine and all sorts of dialects here objections spring up afresh phoenician very good levantine quite right even dialect let that pass they are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces but slang what is the use of preserving slang what is the good of assisting slang to survive to this we reply in one word only assuredly if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study it is the language which has been spoken in france for example for more than four centuries not only by a misery but by every possible human misery and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy is not a business in which choice is permitted the historian of manners and ideas has no less austere a mission than
1411,the historian of events the latter has the surface of civilization the conflicts of crowns the births of princes the marriages of kings battles assemblages great public men revolutions in the daylight everything on the exterior the other historian has the interior the depths the people who toil suffer wait the oppressed woman the agonizing child the secret war between man and man obscure ferocities prejudices plotted iniquities the subterranean the indistinct tremors of multitudes the die of hunger the counter blows of the law the secret evolution of souls the go bare foot the bare armed the disinherited the orphans the unhappy and the infamous all the forms which roam through the darkness he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge to those impenetrable casemates where crawl pell mell those who bleed and those who deal the blow those who weep and those who curse those who fast and those who devour those who endure evil and those who inflict it have these historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians of external facts does any one think that alighieri has
1412,any fewer things to say than machiavelli is the under side of civilization any less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern let us say moreover parenthetically that from a few words of what precedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes of historians which does not exist in our mind no one is a good historian of the patent visible striking and public life of peoples if he is not at the same time in a certain measure the historian of their deep and hidden life and no one is a good historian of the interior unless he understands how at need to be the historian of the exterior also the history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events and this is true reciprocally they constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other which are always interlaced and which often bring forth results all the lineaments which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels sombre but distinct in their depths and all convulsions of the depths
1413,produce ebullitions on the surface true history being a mixture of all things the true historian mingles in everything man is not a circle with a single centre he is an ellipse with a double focus facts form one of these and ideas the other slang is nothing but a dressing room where the tongue having some bad action to perform disguises itself there it clothes itself in word masks in metaphor rags in this guise it becomes horrible one finds it difficult to recognize is it really the french tongue the great human tongue behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort upon crime and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of evil it no longer walks it hobbles it limps on the crutch of the court of miracles a crutch metamorphosable into a club it is called vagrancy every sort of spectre its dressers have painted its face it crawls and rears the double gait of the reptile henceforth it is apt at all roles it is made suspicious by the counterfeiter covered with verdigris by the forger blacked by the soot of the incendiary and the murderer applies its rouge when one
1414,listens by the side of honest men at the portals of society one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside one distinguishes questions and replies one perceives without understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word it is slang the words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic bestiality one thinks one hears hydras talking it is unintelligible in the dark it gnashes and whispers completing the gloom with mystery it is black in misfortune it is blacker still in crime these two blacknesses amalgamated compose slang obscurity in the atmosphere obscurity in acts obscurity in voices terrible toad like tongue which goes and comes leaps crawls slobbers and stirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain and night of hunger of vice of falsehood of injustice of nudity of suffocation and of winter the high noonday of the miserable let us have compassion on the chastised alas who are we ourselves who am i who now address you who are you who are listening to me and are you very sure that we have done nothing before
1415,we were born the earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice look closely at life it is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment are you what is called a happy man well you are sad every day each day has its own great grief or its little care yesterday you were trembling for a health that is dear to you to day you fear for your own to morrow it will be anxiety about money the day after to morrow the diatribe of a slanderer the day after that the misfortune of some friend then the prevailing weather then something that has been broken or lost then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral column reproach you again the course of public affairs this without reckoning in the pains of the heart and so it goes on one cloud is dispelled another forms there is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny and you belong to that small class who are happy as for the rest of mankind stagnating night rests upon them thoughtful
1416,minds make but little use of the phrase the fortunate and the unfortunate in this world evidently the vestibule of another there are no fortunate the real human division is this the luminous and the shady to diminish the number of the shady to augment the number of the luminous that is the object that is why we cry education science to teach reading means to light the fire every syllable spelled out sparkles however he who says light does not necessarily say joy people suffer in the light excess burns the flame is the enemy of the wing to burn without ceasing to fly therein lies the marvel of genius when you shall have learned to know and to love you will still suffer the day is born in tears the luminous weep if only over those in darkness ii roots slang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness thought is moved in its most sombre depths social philosophy is bidden to its most poignant meditations in the presence of that enigmatic dialect at once so blighted and rebellious therein lies chastisement made visible every syllable has an air of being marked the words of the vulgar
1417,tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled as it were beneath the hot iron of the executioner some seem to be still smoking such and such a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a thief branded with the fleur de lys which has suddenly been laid bare ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which are fugitives from justice metaphor is sometimes so shameless that one feels that it has worn the iron neck fetter moreover in spite of all this and because of all this this strange dialect has by rights its own compartment in that great impartial case of pigeon holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as for the gold medal and which is called literature slang whether the public admit the fact or not has its syntax and its poetry it is a language yes by the deformity of certain terms we recognize the fact that it was chewed by mandrin and by the splendor of certain metonymies we feel that villon spoke it that exquisite and celebrated verse mais ou sont les neiges d'antan but where are the snows of years gone by is a verse
1418,of slang antam ante annum is a word of thunes slang which signified the past year and by extension formerly thirty five years ago at the epoch of the departure of the great chain gang there could be read in one of the cells at bicetre this maxim engraved with a nail on the wall by a king of thunes condemned to the galleys les dabs d'antan trimaient siempre pour la pierre du coesre this means kings in days gone by always went and had themselves anointed in the opinion of that king anointment meant the galleys the word decarade which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles at a gallop is attributed to villon and it is worthy of him this word which strikes fire with all four of its feet sums up in a masterly onomatopoeia the whole of la fontaine's admirable verse six forts chevaux tiraient un coche six stout horses drew a coach from a purely literary point of view few studies would prove more curious and fruitful than the study of slang it is a whole language within a language a sort of sickly excrescence an unhealthy graft which has produced a vegetation a parasite which
1419,has its roots in the old gallic trunk and whose sinister foliage crawls all over one side of the language this is what may be called the first the vulgar aspect of slang but for those who study the tongue as it should be studied that is to say as geologists study the earth slang appears like a veritable alluvial deposit according as one digs a longer or shorter distance into it one finds in slang below the old popular french provencal spanish italian levantine that language of the mediterranean ports english and german the romance language in its three varieties french italian and romance romance latin and finally basque and celtic a profound and unique formation a subterranean edifice erected in common by all the miserable each accursed race has deposited its layer each suffering has dropped its stone there each heart has contributed its pebble a throng of evil base or irritated souls who have traversed life and have vanished into eternity linger there almost entirely visible still beneath the form of some monstrous word do you want spanish the old gothic slang abounded in it here is boffete a box on the ear which is derived from

1422,these words which both mask and reveal some le rabouin for example are at the same time grotesque and terrible and produce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace in the second place metaphor the peculiarity of a language which is desirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in figures metaphor is an enigma wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke the prisoner who is arranging an escape take refuge no idiom is more metaphorical than slang devisser le coco to unscrew the nut to twist the neck tortiller to wriggle to eat etre gerbe to be tried a rat a bread thief il lansquine it rains a striking ancient figure which partly bears its date about it which assimilates long oblique lines of rain with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers and which compresses into a single word the popular expression it rains halberds sometimes in proportion as slang progresses from the first epoch to the second words pass from the primitive and savage sense to the metaphorical sense the devil ceases to be le rabouin and becomes le boulanger the baker who puts the bread into the oven this
1423,is more witty but less grand something like racine after corneille like euripides after aeschylus certain slang phrases which participate in the two epochs and have at once the barbaric character and the metaphorical character resemble phantasmagories les sorgueuers vont solliciter des gails a la lune the prowlers are going to steal horses by night this passes before the mind like a group of spectres one knows not what one sees in the third place the expedient slang lives on the language it uses it in accordance with its fancy it dips into it hap hazard and it often confines itself when occasion arises to alter it in a gross and summary fashion occasionally with the ordinary words thus deformed and complicated with words of pure slang picturesque phrases are formed in which there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements the direct creation and the metaphor le cab jaspine je marronne que la roulotte de pantin trime dans le sabri the dog is barking i suspect that the diligence for paris is passing through the woods le dab est sinve la dabuge est merloussiere la fee est bative the bourgeois is stupid the bourgeoise is cunning
1424,the daughter is pretty generally to throw listeners off the track slang confines itself to adding to all the words of the language without distinction an ignoble tail a termination in aille in orgue in iergue or in uche thus vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce gigotmuche do you think that leg of mutton good a phrase addressed by cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sum offered for his escape suited him the termination in mar has been added recently slang being the dialect of corruption quickly becomes corrupted itself besides this as it is always seeking concealment as soon as it feels that it is understood it changes its form contrary to what happens with every other vegetation every ray of light which falls upon it kills whatever it touches thus slang is in constant process of decomposition and recomposition an obscure and rapid work which never pauses it passes over more ground in ten years than a language in ten centuries thus le larton bread becomes le lartif le gail horse becomes le gaye la fertanche straw becomes la fertille le momignard brat le momacque les fiques duds frusques la chique the church l'egrugeoir le

1426,perpetual movement remains its law nevertheless if the philosopher succeeds in fixing for a moment for purposes of observation this language which is incessantly evaporating he falls into doleful and useful meditation no study is more efficacious and more fecund in instruction there is not a metaphor not an analogy in slang which does not contain a lesson among these men to beat means to feign one beats a malady ruse is their strength for them the idea of the man is not separated from the idea of darkness the night is called la sorgue man l'orgue man is a derivative of the night they have taken up the practice of considering society in the light of an atmosphere which kills them of a fatal force and they speak of their liberty as one would speak of his health a man under arrest is a sick man one who is condemned is a dead man the most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls in which he is buried is a sort of glacial chastity and he calls the dungeon the castus in that funereal place life outside always presents itself under its most smiling aspect the prisoner
1427,has irons on his feet you think perhaps that his thought is that it is with the feet that one walks no he is thinking that it is with the feet that one dances so when he has succeeded in severing his fetters his first idea is that now he can dance and he calls the saw the bastringue public house ball a name is a centre profound assimilation the ruffian has two heads one of which reasons out his actions and leads him all his life long and the other which he has upon his shoulders on the day of his death he calls the head which counsels him in crime la sorbonne and the head which expiates it la tronche when a man has no longer anything but rags upon his body and vices in his heart when he has arrived at that double moral and material degradation which the word blackguard characterizes in its two acceptations he is ripe for crime he is like a well whetted knife he has two cutting edges his distress and his malice so slang does not say a blackguard it says un reguise what are the galleys a brazier of damnation
1428,a hell the convict calls himself a fagot and finally what name do malefactors give to their prison the college a whole penitentiary system can be evolved from that word does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of the galleys those refrains called in the special vocabulary lirlonfa have had their birth let him listen to what follows there existed at the chatelet in paris a large and long cellar this cellar was eight feet below the level of the seine it had neither windows nor air holes its only aperture was the door men could enter there air could not this vault had for ceiling a vault of stone and for floor ten inches of mud it was flagged but the pavement had rotted and cracked under the oozing of the water eight feet above the floor a long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side to side from this beam hung at short distances apart chains three feet long and at the end of these chains there were rings for the neck in this vault men who had been condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the day of their departure
1429,for toulon they were thrust under this beam where each one found his fetters swinging in the darkness and waiting for him the chains those pendant arms and the necklets those open hands caught the unhappy wretches by the throat they were rivetted and left there as the chain was too short they could not lie down they remained motionless in that cavern in that night beneath that beam almost hanging forced to unheard of efforts to reach their bread jug or their vault overhead mud even to mid leg filth flowing to their very calves broken asunder with fatigue with thighs and knees giving way clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain some rest unable to sleep except when standing erect and awakened every moment by the strangling of the collar some woke no more in order to eat they pushed the bread which was flung to them in the mud along their leg with their heel until it reached their hand how long did they remain thus one month two months six months sometimes one stayed a year it was the antechamber of the galleys men were put there for stealing a hare

1431,a base of union to betray a secret is to tear from each member of this fierce community something of his own personality to inform against in the energetic slang dialect is called to eat the bit as though the informer drew to himself a little of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit of each one's flesh what does it signify to receive a box on the ear commonplace metaphor replies it is to see thirty six candles here slang intervenes and takes it up candle camoufle thereupon the ordinary tongue gives camouflet as the synonym for soufflet thus by a sort of infiltration from below upwards with the aid of metaphor that incalculable trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to the academy and poulailler saying i light my camoufle causes voltaire to write langleviel la beaumelle deserves a hundred camouflets researches in slang mean discoveries at every step study and investigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point of intersection of regular society with society which is accursed the thief also has his food for cannon stealable matter you i whoever passes by le pantre pan everybody slang is language turned convict that
1432,the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever so low that it can be dragged and pinioned there by obscure tyrannies of fatality that it can be bound by no one knows what fetters in that abyss is sufficient to create consternation oh poor thought of miserable wretches alas will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness is it her destiny there to await forever the mind the liberator the immense rider of pegasi and hippo griffs the combatant of heroes of the dawn who shall descend from the azure between two wings the radiant knight of the future will she forever summon in vain to her assistance the lance of light of the ideal is she condemned to hear the fearful approach of evil through the density of the gulf and to catch glimpses nearer and nearer at hand beneath the hideous water of that dragon's head that maw streaked with foam and that writhing undulation of claws swellings and rings must it remain there without a gleam of light without hope given over to that terrible approach vaguely scented out by the monster shuddering dishevelled wringing its arms forever chained to
1433,the rock of night a sombre andromeda white and naked amid the shadows iii slang which weeps and slang which laughs as the reader perceives slang in its entirety slang of four hundred years ago like the slang of to day is permeated with that sombre symbolical spirit which gives to all words a mien which is now mournful now menacing one feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of those vagrants of the court of miracles who played at cards with packs of their own some of which have come down to us the eight of clubs for instance represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil leaves a sort of fantastic personification of the forest at the foot of this tree a fire was burning over which three hares were roasting a huntsman on a spit and behind him on another fire hung a steaming pot whence emerged the head of a dog nothing can be more melancholy than these reprisals in painting by a pack of cards in the presence of stakes for the roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling of counterfeiters the diverse forms assumed by thought in the realm of
1434,slang even song even raillery even menace all partook of this powerless and dejected character all the songs the melodies of some of which have been collected were humble and lamentable to the point of evoking tears the pegre is always the poor pegre and he is always the hare in hiding the fugitive mouse the flying bird he hardly complains he contents himself with sighing one of his moans has come down to us i do not understand how god the father of men can torture his children and his grandchildren and hear them cry without himself suffering torture the wretch whenever he has time to think makes himself small before the low and frail in the presence of society he lies down flat on his face he entreats he appeals to the side of compassion we feel that he is conscious of his guilt towards the middle of the last century a change took place prison songs and thieves ritournelles assumed so to speak an insolent and jovial mien the plaintive malure was replaced by the larifla we find in the eighteenth century in nearly all the songs of the galleys and prisons a diabolical and enigmatical gayety

1436,as to lose somewhat of their ugliness while communicating much of it to sophisms and doctrines a sign in short of some outbreak which is prodigious and near unless some diversion shall arise let us pause a moment whom are we accusing here is it the eighteenth century is it philosophy certainly not the work of the eighteenth century is healthy and good and wholesome the encyclopedists diderot at their head the physiocrates turgot at their head the philosophers voltaire at their head the utopians rousseau at their head these are four sacred legions humanity's immense advance towards the light is due to them they are the four vanguards of the human race marching towards the four cardinal points of progress diderot towards the beautiful turgot towards the useful voltaire towards the true rousseau towards the just but by the side of and above the philosophers there were the sophists a venomous vegetation mingled with a healthy growth hemlock in the virgin forest while the executioner was burning the great books of the liberators of the century on the grand staircase of the court house writers now forgotten were publishing with the king's sanction no one knows what strangely disorganizing

1449,yet no more in danger than a star in the maw of the clouds eighth enchantments and desolations i full light the reader has probably understood that eponine having recognized through the gate the inhabitant of that rue plumet whither magnon had sent her had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the rue plumet and had then conducted marius thither and that after many days spent in ecstasy before that gate marius drawn on by that force which draws the iron to the magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is built the house of her whom he loves had finally entered cosette's garden as romeo entered the garden of juliet this had even proved easier for him than for romeo romeo was obliged to scale a wall marius had only to use a little force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate which vacillated in its rusty recess after the fashion of old people's teeth marius was slender and readily passed through as there was never any one in the street and as marius never entered the garden except at night he ran no risk of being seen beginning with that blessed and holy
1450,hour when a kiss betrothed these two souls marius was there every evening if at that period of her existence cosette had fallen in love with a man in the least unscrupulous or debauched she would have been lost for there are generous natures which yield themselves and cosette was one of them one of woman's magnanimities is to yield love at the height where it is absolute is complicated with some indescribably celestial blindness of modesty but what dangers you run o noble souls often you give the heart and we take the body your heart remains with you you gaze upon it in the gloom with a shudder love has no middle course it either ruins or it saves all human destiny lies in this dilemma this dilemma ruin or safety is set forth no more inexorably by any fatality than by love love is life if it is not death cradle also coffin the same sentiment says yes and no in the human heart of all the things that god has made the human heart is the one which sheds the most light alas and the most darkness god willed that cosette's love should encounter one of
1451,the loves which save throughout the whole of the month of may of that year there were there in every night in that poor neglected garden beneath that thicket which grew thicker and more fragrant day by day two beings composed of all chastity all innocence overflowing with all the felicity of heaven nearer to the archangels than to mankind pure honest intoxicated radiant who shone for each other amid the shadows it seemed to cosette that marius had a crown and to marius that cosette had a nimbus they touched each other they gazed at each other they clasped each other's hands they pressed close to each other but there was a distance which they did not pass not that they respected it they did not know of its existence marius was conscious of a barrier cosette's innocence and cosette of a support marius loyalty the first kiss had also been the last marius since that time had not gone further than to touch cosette's hand or her kerchief or a lock of her hair with his lips for him cosette was a perfume and not a woman he inhaled her she refused nothing and he asked nothing cosette
1452,was happy and marius was satisfied they lived in this ecstatic state which can be described as the dazzling of one soul by another soul it was the ineffable first embrace of two maiden souls in the ideal two swans meeting on the jungfrau at that hour of love an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely mute beneath the omnipotence of ecstasy marius the pure and seraphic marius would rather have gone to a woman of the town than have raised cosette's robe to the height of her ankle once in the moonlight cosette stooped to pick up something on the ground her bodice fell apart and permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat marius turned away his eyes what took place between these two beings nothing they adored each other at night when they were there that garden seemed a living and a sacred spot all flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense and they opened their souls and scattered them over the flowers the wanton and vigorous vegetation quivered full of strength and intoxication around these two innocents and they uttered words of love which set the trees to trembling what words were these breaths nothing
1453,more these breaths sufficed to trouble and to touch all nature round about magic power which we should find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book these conversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smoke wreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves take from those murmurs of two lovers that melody which proceeds from the soul and which accompanies them like a lyre and what remains is nothing more than a shade you say what is that all eh yes childish prattle repetitions laughter at nothing nonsense everything that is deepest and most sublime in the world the only things which are worth the trouble of saying and hearing the man who has never heard the man who has never uttered these absurdities these paltry remarks is an imbecile and a malicious fellow cosette said to marius dost thou know in all this and athwart this celestial maidenliness and without either of them being able to say how it had come about they had begun to call each other thou dost thou know my name is euphrasie euphrasie why no thy name is cosette oh cosette is a very ugly name that
1454,was given to me when i was a little thing but my real name is euphrasie dost thou like that name euphrasie yes but cosette is not ugly do you like it better than euphrasie why yes then i like it better too truly it is pretty cosette call me cosette and the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy of a grove situated in heaven on another occasion she gazed intently at him and exclaimed monsieur you are handsome you are good looking you are witty you are not at all stupid you are much more learned than i am but i bid you defiance with this word i love you and marius in the very heavens thought he heard a strain sung by a star or she bestowed on him a gentle tap because he coughed and she said to him don't cough sir i will not have people cough on my domain without my permission it's very naughty to cough and to disturb me i want you to be well because in the first place if you were not well i should be very unhappy what should i do then and this was
1455,simply divine once marius said to cosette just imagine i thought at one time that your name was ursule this made both of them laugh the whole evening in the middle of another conversation he chanced to exclaim oh one day at the luxembourg i had a good mind to finish breaking up a veteran but he stopped short and went no further he would have been obliged to speak to cosette of her garter and that was impossible this bordered on a strange theme the flesh before which that immense and innocent love recoiled with a sort of sacred fright marius pictured life with cosette to himself like this without anything else to come every evening to the rue plumet to displace the old and accommodating bar of the chief justice's gate to sit elbow to elbow on that bench to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of the on coming night to fit a fold of the knee of his trousers into the ample fall of cosette's gown to caress her thumb nail to call her thou to smell of the same flower one after the other forever indefinitely during this time clouds passed above their heads
1456,every time that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men than of the clouds of heaven this chaste almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry by any means to pay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method of bestowing caresses and he is half audacious who tries it a compliment is something like a kiss through a veil voluptuousness mingles there with its sweet tiny point while it hides itself the heart draws back before voluptuousness only to love the more marius blandishments all saturated with fancy were so to speak of azure hue the birds when they fly up yonder in the direction of the angels must hear such words there were mingled with them nevertheless life humanity all the positiveness of which marius was capable it was what is said in the bower a prelude to what will be said in the chamber a lyrical effusion strophe and sonnet intermingled pleasing hyperboles of cooing all the refinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet and exhaling a celestial perfume an ineffable twitter of heart to heart oh murmured marius how beautiful you are i dare not look
1457,at you it is all over with me when i contemplate you you are a grace i know not what is the matter with me the hem of your gown when the tip of your shoe peeps from beneath upsets me and then what an enchanted gleam when you open your thought even but a little you talk astonishingly good sense it seems to me at times that you are a dream speak i listen i admire oh cosette how strange it is and how charming i am really beside myself you are adorable mademoiselle i study your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope and cosette answered i have been loving a little more all the time that has passed since this morning questions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue which always turned with mutual consent upon love as the little pith figures always turn on their peg cosette's whole person was ingenuousness ingenuity transparency whiteness candor radiance it might have been said of cosette that she was clear she produced on those who saw her the sensation of april and dawn there was dew in her eyes cosette was a condensation of
1458,the auroral light in the form of a woman it was quite simple that marius should admire her since he adored her but the truth is that this little school girl fresh from the convent talked with exquisite penetration and uttered at times all sorts of true and delicate sayings her prattle was conversation she never made a mistake about anything and she saw things justly the woman feels and speaks with the tender instinct of the heart which is infallible no one understands so well as a woman how to say things that are at once both sweet and deep sweetness and depth they are the whole of woman in them lies the whole of heaven in this full felicity tears welled up to their eyes every instant a crushed lady bug a feather fallen from a nest a branch of hawthorn broken aroused their pity and their ecstasy sweetly mingled with melancholy seemed to ask nothing better than to weep the most sovereign symptom of love is a tenderness that is at times almost unbearable and in addition to this all these contradictions are the lightning play of love they were fond of laughing they laughed readily and
1459,with a delicious freedom and so familiarly that they sometimes presented the air of two boys still though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity nature is always present and will not be forgotten she is there with her brutal and sublime object and however great may be the innocence of souls one feels in the most modest private interview the adorable and mysterious shade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends they idolized each other the permanent and the immutable are persistent people live they smile they laugh they make little grimaces with the tips of their lips they interlace their fingers they call each other thou and that does not prevent eternity two lovers hide themselves in the evening in the twilight in the invisible with the birds with the roses they fascinate each other in the darkness with their hearts which they throw into their eyes they murmur they whisper and in the meantime immense librations of the planets fill the infinite universe ii the bewilderment of perfect happiness they existed vaguely frightened at their happiness they did not notice the cholera which decimated paris precisely during that very month they had confided in
1460,each other as far as possible but this had not extended much further than their names marius had told cosette that he was an orphan that his name was marius pontmercy that he was a lawyer that he lived by writing things for publishers that his father had been a colonel that the latter had been a hero and that he marius was on bad terms with his grandfather who was rich he had also hinted at being a baron but this had produced no effect on cosette she did not know the meaning of the word marius was marius on her side she had confided to him that she had been brought up at the petit picpus convent that her mother like his own was dead that her father's name was m fauchelevent that he was very good that he gave a great deal to the poor but that he was poor himself and that he denied himself everything though he denied her nothing strange to say in the sort of symphony which marius had lived since he had been in the habit of seeing cosette the past even the most recent past had become so confused and distant
1461,to him that what cosette told him satisfied him completely it did not even occur to him to tell her about the nocturnal adventure in the hovel about thenardier about the burn and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father marius had momentarily forgotten all this in the evening he did not even know that there had been a morning what he had done where he had breakfasted nor who had spoken to him he had songs in his ears which rendered him deaf to every other thought he only existed at the hours when he saw cosette then as he was in heaven it was quite natural that he should forget earth both bore languidly the indefinable burden of immaterial pleasures thus lived these somnambulists who are called lovers alas who is there who has not felt all these things why does there come an hour when one emerges from this azure and why does life go on afterwards loving almost takes the place of thinking love is an ardent forgetfulness of all the rest then ask logic of passion if you will there is no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than there
1462,is a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism for cosette and marius nothing existed except marius and cosette the universe around them had fallen into a hole they lived in a golden minute there was nothing before them nothing behind it hardly occurred to marius that cosette had a father his brain was dazzled and obliterated of what did these lovers talk then we have seen of the flowers and the swallows the setting sun and the rising moon and all sorts of important things they had told each other everything except everything the everything of lovers is nothing but the father the realities that lair the ruffians that adventure to what purpose and was he very sure that this nightmare had actually existed they were two and they adored each other and beyond that there was nothing nothing else existed it is probable that this vanishing of hell in our rear is inherent to the arrival of paradise have we beheld demons are there any have we trembled have we suffered we no longer know a rosy cloud hangs over it so these two beings lived in this manner high aloft with all that improbability which is in
1463,nature neither at the nadir nor at the zenith between man and seraphim above the mire below the ether in the clouds hardly flesh and blood soul and ecstasy from head to foot already too sublime to walk the earth still too heavily charged with humanity to disappear in the blue suspended like atoms which are waiting to be precipitated apparently beyond the bounds of destiny ignorant of that rut yesterday to day to morrow amazed rapturous floating soaring at times so light that they could take their flight out into the infinite almost prepared to soar away to all eternity they slept wide awake thus sweetly lulled oh splendid lethargy of the real overwhelmed by the ideal sometimes beautiful as cosette was marius shut his eyes in her presence the best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes marius and cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead them they considered that they had already arrived it is a strange claim on man's part to wish that love should lead to something iii the beginning of shadow jean valjean suspected nothing cosette who was rather less dreamy than marius was gay and that sufficed for
1464,jean valjean's happiness the thoughts which cosette cherished her tender preoccupations marius image which filled her heart took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful chaste and smiling brow she was at the age when the virgin bears her love as the angel his lily so jean valjean was at ease and then when two lovers have come to an understanding things always go well the third party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect blindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the same in the case of all lovers thus cosette never objected to any of jean valjean's proposals did she want to take a walk yes dear little father did she want to stay at home very good did he wish to pass the evening with cosette she was delighted as he always went to bed at ten o'clock marius did not come to the garden on such occasions until after that hour when from the street he heard cosette open the long glass door on the veranda of course no one ever met marius in the daytime jean valjean never even dreamed any longer that marius was
1465,in existence only once one morning he chanced to say to cosette why you have whitewash on your back on the previous evening marius in a transport had pushed cosette against the wall old toussaint who retired early thought of nothing but her sleep and was as ignorant of the whole matter as jean valjean marius never set foot in the house when he was with cosette they hid themselves in a recess near the steps in order that they might neither be seen nor heard from the street and there they sat frequently contenting themselves by way of conversation with pressing each other's hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of the trees at such times a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces from them and they would not have noticed it so deeply was the revery of the one absorbed and sunk in the revery of the other limpid purity hours wholly white almost all alike this sort of love is a recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove the whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street every time that marius entered and left he carefully adjusted
1466,the bar of the gate in such a manner that no displacement was visible he usually went away about midnight and returned to courfeyrac's lodgings courfeyrac said to bahorel would you believe it marius comes home nowadays at one o'clock in the morning bahorel replied what do you expect there's always a petard in a seminary fellow at times courfeyrac folded his arms assumed a serious air and said to marius you are getting irregular in your habits young man courfeyrac being a practical man did not take in good part this reflection of an invisible paradise upon marius he was not much in the habit of concealed passions it made him impatient and now and then he called upon marius to come back to reality one morning he threw him this admonition my dear fellow you produce upon me the effect of being located in the moon the realm of dreams the province of illusions capital soap bubble come be a good boy what's her name but nothing could induce marius to talk they might have torn out his nails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable name cosette was composed true love is as
1467,luminous as the dawn and as silent as the tomb only courfeyrac saw this change in marius that his taciturnity was of the beaming order during this sweet month of may marius and cosette learned to know these immense delights to dispute and to say you for thou simply that they might say thou the better afterwards to talk at great length with very minute details of persons in whom they took not the slightest interest in the world another proof that in that ravishing opera called love the libretto counts for almost nothing for marius to listen to cosette discussing finery for cosette to listen to marius talk in politics to listen knee pressed to knee to the carriages rolling along the rue de babylone to gaze upon the same planet in space or at the same glowworm gleaming in the grass to hold their peace together a still greater delight than conversation etc etc in the meantime divers complications were approaching one evening marius was on his way to the rendezvous by way of the boulevard des invalides he habitually walked with drooping head as he was on the point of turning the corner of the rue plumet
1468,he heard some one quite close to him say good evening monsieur marius he raised his head and recognized eponine this produced a singular effect upon him he had not thought of that girl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the rue plumet he had not seen her again and she had gone completely out of his mind he had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her he owed her his happiness and yet it was embarrassing to him to meet her it is an error to think that passion when it is pure and happy leads man to a state of perfection it simply leads him as we have noted to a state of oblivion in this situation man forgets to be bad but he also forgets to be good gratitude duty matters essential and important to be remembered vanish at any other time marius would have behaved quite differently to eponine absorbed in cosette he had not even clearly put it to himself that this eponine was named eponine thenardier and that she bore the name inscribed in his father's will that name for which but a few months before he
1469,would have so ardently sacrificed himself we show marius as he was his father himself was fading out of his soul to some extent under the splendor of his love he replied with some embarrassment ah so it's you eponine why do you call me you have i done anything to you no he answered certainly he had nothing against her far from it only he felt that he could not do otherwise now that he used thou to cosette than say you to eponine as he remained silent she exclaimed say then she paused it seemed as though words failed that creature formerly so heedless and so bold she tried to smile and could not then she resumed well then she paused again and remained with downcast eyes good evening mr marius said she suddenly and abruptly and away she went iv a cab runs in english and barks in slang the following day was the d of june a date which it is necessary to indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on the horizon of paris in the state of lightning charged clouds marius at nightfall was pursuing the same road as
1470,on the preceding evening with the same thoughts of delight in his heart when he caught sight of eponine approaching through the trees of the boulevard two days in succession this was too much he turned hastily aside quitted the boulevard changed his course and went to the rue plumet through the rue monsieur this caused eponine to follow him to the rue plumet a thing which she had not yet done up to that time she had contented herself with watching him on his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to encounter him it was only on the evening before that she had attempted to address him so eponine followed him without his suspecting the fact she saw him displace the bar and slip into the garden she approached the railing felt of the bars one after the other and readily recognized the one which marius had moved she murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents none of that lisette she seated herself on the underpinning of the railing close beside the bar as though she were guarding it it was precisely at the point where the railing touched the neighboring wall there was a dim
1471,nook there in which eponine was entirely concealed she remained thus for more than an hour without stirring and without breathing a prey to her thoughts towards ten o'clock in the evening one of the two or three persons who passed through the rue plumet an old belated bourgeois who was making haste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute as he skirted the garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall heard a dull and threatening voice saying i'm no longer surprised that he comes here every evening the passer by cast a glance around him saw no one dared not peer into the black niche and was greatly alarmed he redoubled his pace this passer by had reason to make haste for a very few instants later six men who were marching separately and at some distance from each other along the wall and who might have been taken for a gray patrol entered the rue plumet the first to arrive at the garden railing halted and waited for the others a second later all six were reunited these men began to talk in a low voice this is the place said
1472,one of them is there a cab dog in the garden asked another i don't know in any case i have fetched a ball that we'll make him eat have you some putty to break the pane with yes the railing is old interpolated a fifth who had the voice of a ventriloquist so much the better said the second who had spoken it won't screech under the saw and it won't be hard to cut the sixth who had not yet opened his lips now began to inspect the gate as eponine had done an hour earlier grasping each bar in succession and shaking them cautiously thus he came to the bar which marius had loosened as he was on the point of grasping this bar a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness fell upon his arm he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in the middle of his breast and a hoarse voice said to him but not loudly there's a dog at the same moment he perceived a pale girl standing before him the man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings he bristled up in hideous wise nothing is so formidable to behold
1473,as ferocious beasts who are uneasy their terrified air evokes terror he recoiled and stammered what jade is this your daughter it was in fact eponine who had addressed thenardier at the apparition of eponine the other five that is to say claquesous guelemer babet brujon and montparnasse had noiselessly drawn near without precipitation without uttering a word with the sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands guelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call fanchons ah see here what are you about there what do you want with us are you crazy exclaimed thenardier as loudly as one can exclaim and still speak low what have you come here to hinder our work for eponine burst out laughing and threw herself on his neck i am here little father because i am here isn't a person allowed to sit on the stones nowadays it's you who ought not to be here what have you come here for since it's a biscuit i told magnon so there's nothing to be done here but embrace me my good little father it's a long time since
1474,i've seen you so you're out thenardier tried to disentangle himself from eponine's arms and grumbled that's good you've embraced me yes i'm out i'm not in now get away with you but eponine did not release her hold and redoubled her caresses but how did you manage it little pa you must have been very clever to get out of that tell me about it and my mother where is mother tell me about mamma thenardier replied she's well i don't know let me alone and be off i tell you i won't go so there now pouted eponine like a spoiled child you send me off and it's four months since i saw you and i've hardly had time to kiss you and she caught her father round the neck again come now this is stupid said babet make haste said guelemer the cops may pass the ventriloquist's voice repeated his distich nous n sommes pas le jour de l'an this isn't new year's day a becoter papa maman to peck at pa and ma eponine turned to the five ruffians why it's monsieur brujon good day monsieur babet good day monsieur claquesous don't you know me monsieur
1475,guelemer how goes it montparnasse yes they know you ejaculated thenardier but good day good evening sheer off leave us alone it's the hour for foxes not for chickens said montparnasse you see the job we have on hand here added babet eponine caught montparnasse's hand take care said he you'll cut yourself i've a knife open my little montparnasse responded eponine very gently you must have confidence in people i am the daughter of my father perhaps monsieur babet monsieur guelemer i'm the person who was charged to investigate this matter it is remarkable that eponine did not talk slang that frightful tongue had become impossible to her since she had known marius she pressed in her hand small bony and feeble as that of a skeleton guelemer's huge coarse fingers and continued you know well that i'm no fool ordinarily i am believed i have rendered you service on various occasions well i have made inquiries you will expose yourselves to no purpose you see i swear to you that there is nothing in this house there are lone women said guelemer no the persons have moved away the candles haven't anyway ejaculated babet and he pointed out
1476,to eponine across the tops of the trees a light which was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion it was toussaint who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry eponine made a final effort well said she they're very poor folks and it's a hovel where there isn't a sou go to the devil cried thenardier when we've turned the house upside down and put the cellar at the top and the attic below we'll tell you what there is inside and whether it's francs or sous or half farthings and he pushed her aside with the intention of entering my good friend mr montparnasse said eponine i entreat you you are a good fellow don't enter take care you'll cut yourself replied montparnasse thenardier resumed in his decided tone decamp my girl and leave men to their own affairs eponine released montparnasse's hand which she had grasped again and said so you mean to enter this house rather grinned the ventriloquist then she set her back against the gate faced the six ruffians who were armed to the teeth and to whom the night lent the visages of demons and said in a
1477,firm low voice well i don't mean that you shall they halted in amazement the ventriloquist however finished his grin she went on friends listen well this is not what you want now i'm talking in the first place if you enter this garden if you lay a hand on this gate i'll scream i'll beat on the door i'll rouse everybody i'll have the whole six of you seized i'll call the police she'd do it too said thenardier in a low tone to brujon and the ventriloquist she shook her head and added beginning with my father thenardier stepped nearer not so close my good man said she he retreated growling between his teeth why what's the matter with her and he added bitch she began to laugh in a terrible way as you like but you shall not enter here i'm not the daughter of a dog since i'm the daughter of a wolf there are six of you what matters that to me you are men well i'm a woman you don't frighten me i tell you that you shan't enter this house because it doesn't suit me if you approach i'll bark i told you
1478,i'm the dog and i don't care a straw for you go your way you bore me go where you please but don't come here i forbid it you can use your knives i'll use kicks it's all the same to me come on she advanced a pace nearer the ruffians she was terrible she burst out laughing pardine i'm not afraid i shall be hungry this summer and i shall be cold this winter aren't they ridiculous these ninnies of men to think they can scare a girl what scare oh yes much because you have finical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on a big voice forsooth i ain't afraid of anything that i ain't she fastened her intent gaze upon thenardier and said not even of you father then she continued as she cast her blood shot spectre like eyes upon the ruffians in turn what do i care if i'm picked up to morrow morning on the pavement of the rue plumet killed by the blows of my father's club or whether i'm found a year from now in the nets at saint cloud or the isle of swans in the
1479,midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs she was forced to pause she was seized by a dry cough her breath came from her weak and narrow chest like the death rattle she resumed i have only to cry out and people will come and then slap bang there are six of you i represent the whole world thenardier made a movement towards her don't approach she cried he halted and said gently well no i won't approach but don't speak so loud so you intend to hinder us in our work my daughter but we must earn our living all the same have you no longer any kind feeling for your father you bother me said eponine but we must live we must eat burst so saying she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and hummed mon bras si dodu my arm so plump ma jambe bien faite my leg well formed et le temps perdu and time wasted she had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand and she swung her foot with an air of indifference her tattered gown permitted a view of her thin shoulder blades the neighboring
1480,street lantern illuminated her profile and her attitude nothing more resolute and more surprising could be seen the six rascals speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a girl retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern and held counsel with furious and humiliated shrugs in the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air there's something the matter with her said babet a reason is she in love with the dog it's a shame to miss this anyway two women an old fellow who lodges in the back yard and curtains that ain't so bad at the windows the old cove must be a jew i think the job's a good one well go in then the rest of you exclaimed montparnasse do the job i'll stay here with the girl and if she fails us he flashed the knife which he held open in his hand in the light of the lantern thenardier said not a word and seemed ready for whatever the rest pleased brujon who was somewhat of an oracle and who had as the reader knows put up the job had not as yet spoken he seemed thoughtful he had
1481,the reputation of not sticking at anything and it was known that he had plundered a police post simply out of bravado besides this he made verses and songs which gave him great authority babet interrogated him you say nothing brujon brujon remained silent an instant longer then he shook his head in various ways and finally concluded to speak see here this morning i came across two sparrows fighting this evening i jostled a woman who was quarrelling all that's bad let's quit they went away as they went montparnasse muttered never mind if they had wanted i'd have cut her throat babet responded i wouldn't i don't hit a lady at the corner of the street they halted and exchanged the following enigmatical dialogue in a low tone where shall we go to sleep to night under pantin paris have you the key to the gate thenardier pardi eponine who never took her eyes off of them saw them retreat by the road by which they had come she rose and began to creep after them along the walls and the houses she followed them thus as far as the boulevard there they parted and she saw these
1482,six men plunge into the gloom where they appeared to melt away v things of the night after the departure of the ruffians the rue plumet resumed its tranquil nocturnal aspect that which had just taken place in this street would not have astonished a forest the lofty trees the copses the heaths the branches rudely interlaced the tall grass exist in a sombre manner the savage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden apparitions of the invisible that which is below man distinguishes through the mists that which is beyond man and the things of which we living beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the night nature bristling and wild takes alarm at certain approaches in which she fancies that she feels the supernatural the forces of the gloom know each other and are strangely balanced by each other teeth and claws fear what they cannot grasp blood drinking bestiality voracious appetites hunger in search of prey the armed instincts of nails and jaws which have for source and aim the belly glare and smell out uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a shroud erect in its vague and shuddering robe and which seem to them
1483,to live with a dead and terrible life these brutalities which are only matter entertain a confused fear of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an unknown being a black figure barring the way stops the wild beast short that which emerges from the cemetery intimidates and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave the ferocious fear the sinister wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul vi marius becomes practical once more to the extent of giving cosette his address while this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over the gate and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl marius was by cosette's side never had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming the trees more trembling the odor of the grass more penetrating never had the birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise never had all the harmonies of universal serenity responded more thoroughly to the inward music of love never had marius been more captivated more happy more ecstatic but he had found cosette sad cosette had been weeping her eyes were red this was the first cloud in that wonderful dream
1484,marius first word had been what is the matter and she had replied this then she had seated herself on the bench near the steps and while he tremblingly took his place beside her she had continued my father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness because he has business and we may go away from here marius shivered from head to foot when one is at the end of one's life to die means to go away when one is at the beginning of it to go away means to die for the last six weeks marius had little by little slowly by degrees taken possession of cosette each day as we have already explained in the case of first love the soul is taken long before the body later on one takes the body long before the soul sometimes one does not take the soul at all the faublas and the prudhommes add because there is none but the sarcasm is fortunately a blasphemy so marius possessed cosette as spirits possess but he enveloped her with all his soul and seized her jealously with incredible conviction he possessed her smile her breath her perfume the profound
1485,radiance of her blue eyes the sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand the charming mark which she had on her neck all her thoughts therefore he possessed all cosette's dreams he incessantly gazed at and he sometimes touched lightly with his breath the short locks on the nape of her neck and he declared to himself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not belong to him marius he gazed upon and adored the things that she wore her knot of ribbon her gloves her sleeves her shoes her cuffs as sacred objects of which he was the master he dreamed that he was the lord of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair and he even said to himself in confused and suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness which did not make their way to the light that there was not a ribbon of her gown not a mesh in her stockings not a fold in her bodice which was not his beside cosette he felt himself beside his own property his own thing his own despot and his slave it seemed as though they had so intermingled their souls that
1486,it would have been impossible to tell them apart had they wished to take them back again this is mine no it is mine i assure you that you are mistaken this is my property what you are taking as your own is myself marius was something that made a part of cosette and cosette was something which made a part of marius marius felt cosette within him to have cosette to possess cosette this to him was not to be distinguished from breathing it was in the midst of this faith of this intoxication of this virgin possession unprecedented and absolute of this sovereignty that these words we are going away fell suddenly at a blow and that the harsh voice of reality cried to him cosette is not yours marius awoke for six weeks marius had been living as we have said outside of life those words going away caused him to re enter it harshly he found not a word to say cosette merely felt that his hand was very cold she said to him in her turn what is the matter he replied in so low a tone that cosette hardly heard him i did not
1487,understand what you said she began again this morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to hold myself in readiness that he would give me his linen to put in a trunk that he was obliged to go on a journey that we were to go away that it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for him and that all is to be ready in a week from now and that we might go to england but this is outrageous exclaimed marius it is certain that at that moment no abuse of power no violence not one of the abominations of the worst tyrants no action of busiris of tiberius or of henry viii could have equalled this in atrocity in the opinion of marius m fauchelevent taking his daughter off to england because he had business there he demanded in a weak voice and when do you start he did not say when and when shall you return he did not say when marius rose and said coldly cosette shall you go cosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes all filled with anguish and replied in a
1488,sort of bewilderment where to england shall you go why do you say you to me i ask you whether you will go what do you expect me to do she said clasping her hands so you will go if my father goes so you will go cosette took marius hand and pressed it without replying very well said marius then i will go elsewhere cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words she turned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom she stammered what do you mean marius looked at her then raised his eyes to heaven and answered nothing when his eyes fell again he saw cosette smiling at him the smile of a woman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance even at night how silly we are marius i have an idea what is it if we go away do you go too i will tell you where come and join me wherever i am marius was now a thoroughly roused man he had fallen back into reality he cried to cosette go away with you are you mad why i should have to have money and i have none go
1489,to england but i am in debt now i owe i don't know how much more than ten louis to courfeyrac one of my friends with whom you are not acquainted i have an old hat which is not worth three francs i have a coat which lacks buttons in front my shirt is all ragged my elbows are torn my boots let in the water for the last six weeks i have not thought about it and i have not told you about it you only see me at night and you give me your love if you were to see me in the daytime you would give me a sou go to england eh i haven't enough to pay for a passport he threw himself against a tree which was close at hand erect his brow pressed close to the bark feeling neither the wood which flayed his skin nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples and there he stood motionless on the point of falling like the statue of despair he remained a long time thus one could remain for eternity in such abysses at last he turned round he heard behind him a faint
1490,stifled noise which was sweet yet sad it was cosette sobbing she had been weeping for more than two hours beside marius as he meditated he came to her fell at her knees and slowly prostrating himself he took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe and kissed it she let him have his way in silence there are moments when a woman accepts like a sombre and resigned goddess the religion of love do not weep he said she murmured not when i may be going away and you cannot come he went on do you love me she replied sobbing by that word from paradise which is never more charming than amid tears i adore you he continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress do not weep tell me will you do this for me and cease to weep do you love me said she he took her hand cosette i have never given my word of honor to any one because my word of honor terrifies me i feel that my father is by my side well i give you my most sacred word of honor that if you go
1491,away i shall die in the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so solemn and so tranquil that cosette trembled she felt that chill which is produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by the shock made her cease weeping now listen said he do not expect me to morrow why do not expect me until the day after to morrow oh why you will see a day without seeing you but that is impossible let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives perhaps and marius added in a low tone and in an aside he is a man who never changes his habits and he has never received any one except in the evening of what man are you speaking asked cosette i i said nothing what do you hope then wait until the day after to morrow you wish it yes cosette she took his head in both her hands raising herself on tiptoe in order to be on a level with him and tried to read his hope in his eyes marius resumed now that i think of it you ought to know my address
1492,something might happen one never knows i live with that friend named courfeyrac rue de la verrerie no he searched in his pocket pulled out his penknife and with the blade he wrote on the plaster of the wall rue de la verrerie in the meantime cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more tell me your thought marius you have some idea tell it to me oh tell me so that i may pass a pleasant night this is my idea that it is impossible that god should mean to part us wait expect me the day after to morrow what shall i do until then said cosette you are outside you go and come how happy men are i shall remain entirely alone oh how sad i shall be what is it that you are going to do to morrow evening tell me i am going to try something then i will pray to god and i will think of you here so that you may be successful i will question you no further since you do not wish it you are my master i shall pass the evening to morrow in singing that music from
1493,euryanthe that you love and that you came one evening to listen to outside my shutters but day after to morrow you will come early i shall expect you at dusk at nine o'clock precisely i warn you mon dieu how sad it is that the days are so long on the stroke of nine do you understand i shall be in the garden and i also and without having uttered it moved by the same thought impelled by those electric currents which place lovers in continual communication both being intoxicated with delight even in their sorrow they fell into each other's arms without perceiving that their lips met while their uplifted eyes overflowing with rapture and full of tears gazed upon the stars when marius went forth the street was deserted this was the moment when eponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard while marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree an idea had crossed his mind an idea alas that he himself judged to be senseless and impossible he had come to a desperate decision vii the old heart and the young heart in the presence of each other at that epoch father
1494,gillenormand was well past his ninety first birthday he still lived with mademoiselle gillenormand in the rue des filles du calvaire no in the old house which he owned he was as the reader will remember one of those antique old men who await death perfectly erect whom age bears down without bending and whom even sorrow cannot curve still his daughter had been saying for some time my father is sinking he no longer boxed the maids ears he no longer thumped the landing place so vigorously with his cane when basque was slow in opening the door the revolution of july had exasperated him for the space of barely six months he had viewed almost tranquilly that coupling of words in the moniteur m humblot conte peer of france the fact is that the old man was deeply dejected he did not bend he did not yield this was no more a characteristic of his physical than of his moral nature but he felt himself giving way internally for four years he had been waiting for marius with his foot firmly planted that is the exact word in the conviction that that good for nothing young scamp would
1495,ring at his door some day or other now he had reached the point where at certain gloomy hours he said to himself that if marius made him wait much longer it was not death that was insupportable to him it was the idea that perhaps he should never see marius again the idea of never seeing marius again had never entered his brain until that day now the thought began to recur to him and it chilled him absence as is always the case in genuine and natural sentiments had only served to augment the grandfather's love for the ungrateful child who had gone off like a flash it is during december nights when the cold stands at ten degrees that one thinks oftenest of the son m gillenormand was or thought himself above all things incapable of taking a single step he the grandfather towards his grandson i would die rather he said to himself he did not consider himself as the least to blame but he thought of marius only with profound tenderness and the mute despair of an elderly kindly old man who is about to vanish in the dark he began to lose his teeth
1496,which added to his sadness m gillenormand without however acknowledging it to himself for it would have rendered him furious and ashamed had never loved a mistress as he loved marius he had had placed in his chamber opposite the head of his bed so that it should be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking an old portrait of his other daughter who was dead madame pontmercy a portrait which had been taken when she was eighteen he gazed incessantly at that portrait one day he happened to say as he gazed upon it i think the likeness is strong to my sister inquired mademoiselle gillenormand yes certainly the old man added and to him also once as he sat with his knees pressed together and his eyes almost closed in a despondent attitude his daughter ventured to say to him father are you as angry with him as ever she paused not daring to proceed further with whom he demanded with that poor marius he raised his aged head laid his withered and emaciated fist on the table and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone poor marius do you say that gentleman is
1497,a knave a wretched scoundrel a vain little ingrate a heartless soulless haughty and wicked man and he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that stood in his eye three days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours to say to his daughter point blank i had the honor to ask mademoiselle gillenormand never to mention him to me aunt gillenormand renounced every effort and pronounced this acute diagnosis my father never cared very much for my sister after her folly it is clear that he detests marius after her folly meant after she had married the colonel however as the reader has been able to conjecture mademoiselle gillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite the officer of lancers for marius the substitute theodule had not been a success m gillenormand had not accepted the quid pro quo a vacancy in the heart does not accommodate itself to a stop gap theodule on his side though he scented the inheritance was disgusted at the task of pleasing the goodman bored the lancer and the lancer shocked the goodman lieutenant theodule was gay no doubt but a chatter box frivolous
1498,but vulgar a high liver but a frequenter of bad company he had mistresses it is true and he had a great deal to say about them it is true also but he talked badly all his good qualities had a defect m gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about the love affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the rue de babylone and then lieutenant gillenormand sometimes came in his uniform with the tricolored cockade this rendered him downright intolerable finally father gillenormand had said to his daughter i've had enough of that theodule i haven't much taste for warriors in time of peace receive him if you choose i don't know but i prefer slashers to fellows that drag their swords the clash of blades in battle is less dismal after all than the clank of the scabbard on the pavement and then throwing out your chest like a bully and lacing yourself like a girl with stays under your cuirass is doubly ridiculous when one is a veritable man one holds equally aloof from swagger and from affected airs he is neither a blusterer nor a finnicky hearted man keep your
1499,theodule for yourself it was in vain that his daughter said to him but he is your grandnephew nevertheless it turned out that m gillenormand who was a grandfather to the very finger tips was not in the least a grand uncle in fact as he had good sense and as he had compared the two theodule had only served to make him regret marius all the more one evening it was the th of june which did not prevent father gillenormand having a rousing fire on the hearth he had dismissed his daughter who was sewing in a neighboring apartment he was alone in his chamber amid its pastoral scenes with his feet propped on the andirons half enveloped in his huge screen of coromandel lacquer with its nine leaves with his elbow resting on a table where burned two candles under a green shade engulfed in his tapestry armchair and in his hand a book which he was not reading he was dressed according to his wont like an incroyable and resembled an antique portrait by garat this would have made people run after him in the street had not his daughter covered him up whenever he went
1500,out in a vast bishop's wadded cloak which concealed his attire at home he never wore a dressing gown except when he rose and retired it gives one a look of age said he father gillenormand was thinking of marius lovingly and bitterly and as usual bitterness predominated his tenderness once soured always ended by boiling and turning to indignation he had reached the point where a man tries to make up his mind and to accept that which rends his heart he was explaining to himself that there was no longer any reason why marius should return that if he intended to return he should have done it long ago that he must renounce the idea he was trying to accustom himself to the thought that all was over and that he should die without having beheld that gentleman again but his whole nature revolted his aged paternity would not consent to this well said he this was his doleful refrain he will not return his bald head had fallen upon his breast and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gaze upon the ashes on his hearth in the very midst of his revery his old servant basque entered
1501,and inquired can monsieur receive m marius the old man sat up erect pallid and like a corpse which rises under the influence of a galvanic shock all his blood had retreated to his heart he stammered m marius what i don't know replied basque intimidated and put out of countenance by his master's air i have not seen him nicolette came in and said to me there's a young man here say that it is m marius father gillenormand stammered in a low voice show him in and he remained in the same attitude with shaking head and his eyes fixed on the door it opened once more a young man entered it was marius marius halted at the door as though waiting to be bidden to enter his almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused by the shade nothing could be seen but his calm grave but strangely sad face it was several minutes before father gillenormand dulled with amazement and joy could see anything except a brightness as when one is in the presence of an apparition he was on the point of swooning he saw marius through a dazzling light it certainly was
1502,he it certainly was marius at last after the lapse of four years he grasped him entire so to speak in a single glance he found him noble handsome distinguished well grown a complete man with a suitable mien and a charming air he felt a desire to open his arms to call him to fling himself forward his heart melted with rapture affectionate words swelled and overflowed his breast at length all his tenderness came to the light and reached his lips and by a contrast which constituted the very foundation of his nature what came forth was harshness he said abruptly what have you come here for marius replied with embarrassment monsieur m gillenormand would have liked to have marius throw himself into his arms he was displeased with marius and with himself he was conscious that he was brusque and that marius was cold it caused the goodman unendurable and irritating anxiety to feel so tender and forlorn within and only to be able to be hard outside bitterness returned he interrupted marius in a peevish tone then why did you come that then signified if you do not come to embrace me marius looked at his
1503,grandfather whose pallor gave him a face of marble monsieur have you come to beg my pardon do you acknowledge your faults he thought he was putting marius on the right road and that the child would yield marius shivered it was the denial of his father that was required of him he dropped his eyes and replied no sir then exclaimed the old man impetuously with a grief that was poignant and full of wrath what do you want of me marius clasped his hands advanced a step and said in a feeble and trembling voice sir have pity on me these words touched m gillenormand uttered a little sooner they would have rendered him tender but they came too late the grandfather rose he supported himself with both hands on his cane his lips were white his brow wavered but his lofty form towered above marius as he bowed pity on you sir it is youth demanding pity of the old man of ninety one you are entering into life i am leaving it you go to the play to balls to the cafe to the billiard hall you have wit you please the women you are a
1504,handsome fellow as for me i spit on my brands in the heart of summer you are rich with the only riches that are really such i possess all the poverty of age infirmity isolation you have your thirty two teeth a good digestion bright eyes strength appetite health gayety a forest of black hair i have no longer even white hair i have lost my teeth i am losing my legs i am losing my memory there are three names of streets that i confound incessantly the rue charlot the rue du chaume and the rue saint claude that is what i have come to you have before you the whole future full of sunshine and i am beginning to lose my sight so far am i advancing into the night you are in love that is a matter of course i am beloved by no one in all the world and you ask pity of me parbleu moliere forgot that if that is the way you jest at the courthouse messieurs the lawyers i sincerely compliment you you are droll and the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice come now what do you want of
1505,me sir said marius i know that my presence is displeasing to you but i have come merely to ask one thing of you and then i shall go away immediately you are a fool said the old man who said that you were to go away this was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom of his heart ask my pardon throw yourself on my neck m gillenormand felt that marius would leave him in a few moments that his harsh reception had repelled the lad that his hardness was driving him away he said all this to himself and it augmented his grief and as his grief was straightway converted into wrath it increased his harshness he would have liked to have marius understand and marius did not understand which made the goodman furious he began again what you deserted me your grandfather you left my house to go no one knows whither you drove your aunt to despair you went off it is easily guessed to lead a bachelor life it's more convenient to play the dandy to come in at all hours to amuse yourself you have given me no signs of
1506,life you have contracted debts without even telling me to pay them you have become a smasher of windows and a blusterer and at the end of four years you come to me and that is all you have to say to me this violent fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was productive only of silence on the part of marius m gillenormand folded his arms a gesture which with him was peculiarly imperious and apostrophized marius bitterly let us make an end of this you have come to ask something of me you say well what what is it speak sir said marius with the look of a man who feels that he is falling over a precipice i have come to ask your permission to marry m gillenormand rang the bell basque opened the door half way call my daughter a second later the door was opened once more mademoiselle gillenormand did not enter but showed herself marius was standing mute with pendant arms and the face of a criminal m gillenormand was pacing back and forth in the room he turned to his daughter and said to her nothing it is monsieur marius say good day
1507,to him monsieur wishes to marry that's all go away the curt hoarse sound of the old man's voice announced a strange degree of excitement the aunt gazed at marius with a frightened air hardly appeared to recognize him did not allow a gesture or a syllable to escape her and disappeared at her father's breath more swiftly than a straw before the hurricane in the meantime father gillenormand had returned and placed his back against the chimney piece once more you marry at one and twenty you have arranged that you have only a permission to ask a formality sit down sir well you have had a revolution since i had the honor to see you last the jacobins got the upper hand you must have been delighted are you not a republican since you are a baron you can make that agree the republic makes a good sauce for the barony are you one of those decorated by july have you taken the louvre at all sir quite near here in the rue saint antoine opposite the rue des nonamdieres there is a cannon ball incrusted in the wall of the third story of a house with this
1508,inscription july th go take a look at that it produces a good effect ah those friends of yours do pretty things by the way aren't they erecting a fountain in the place of the monument of m le duc de berry so you want to marry whom can one inquire without indiscretion he paused and before marius had time to answer he added violently come now you have a profession a fortune made how much do you earn at your trade of lawyer nothing said marius with a sort of firmness and resolution that was almost fierce nothing then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred livres that i allow you marius did not reply m gillenormand continued then i understand the girl is rich as rich as i am what no dowry no expectations i think not utterly naked what's the father i don't know and what's her name mademoiselle fauchelevent fauchewhat fauchelevent pttt ejaculated the old gentleman sir exclaimed marius m gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking to himself that's right one and twenty years of age no profession twelve hundred livres a year madame la baronne
1509,de pontmercy will go and purchase a couple of sous worth of parsley from the fruiterer sir repeated marius in the despair at the last hope which was vanishing i entreat you i conjure you in the name of heaven with clasped hands sir i throw myself at your feet permit me to marry her the old man burst into a shout of strident and mournful laughter coughing and laughing at the same time ah ah ah you said to yourself pardine i'll go hunt up that old blockhead that absurd numskull what a shame that i'm not twenty five how i'd treat him to a nice respectful summons how nicely i'd get along without him it's nothing to me i'd say to him you're only too happy to see me you old idiot i want to marry i desire to wed mamselle no matter whom daughter of monsieur no matter what i have no shoes she has no chemise that just suits i want to throw my career my future my youth my life to the dogs i wish to take a plunge into wretchedness with a woman around my neck that's an idea and you must consent to
1510,it and the old fossil will consent go my lad do as you like attach your paving stone marry your pousselevent your coupelevent never sir never father never at the tone in which that never was uttered marius lost all hope he traversed the chamber with slow steps with bowed head tottering and more like a dying man than like one merely taking his departure m gillenormand followed him with his eyes and at the moment when the door opened and marius was on the point of going out he advanced four paces with the senile vivacity of impetuous and spoiled old gentlemen seized marius by the collar brought him back energetically into the room flung him into an armchair and said to him tell me all about it it was that single word father which had effected this revolution marius stared at him in bewilderment m gillenormand's mobile face was no longer expressive of anything but rough and ineffable good nature the grandsire had given way before the grandfather come see here speak tell me about your love affairs jabber tell me everything sapristi how stupid young folks are father repeated marius the old man's entire countenance lighted up
1511,with indescribable radiance yes that's right call me father and you'll see there was now something so kind so gentle so openhearted and so paternal in this brusqueness that marius in the sudden transition from discouragement to hope was stunned and intoxicated by it as it were he was seated near the table the light from the candles brought out the dilapidation of his costume which father gillenormand regarded with amazement well father said marius ah by the way interrupted m gillenormand you really have not a penny then you are dressed like a pickpocket he rummaged in a drawer drew forth a purse which he laid on the table here are a hundred louis buy yourself a hat father pursued marius my good father if you only knew i love her you cannot imagine it the first time i saw her was at the luxembourg she came there in the beginning i did not pay much heed to her and then i don't know how it came about i fell in love with her oh how unhappy that made me now at last i see her every day at her own home her father does not know it just
1512,fancy they are going away it is in the garden that we meet in the evening her father means to take her to england then i said to myself i'll go and see my grandfather and tell him all about the affair i should go mad first i should die i should fall ill i should throw myself into the water i absolutely must marry her since i should go mad otherwise this is the whole truth and i do not think that i have omitted anything she lives in a garden with an iron fence in the rue plumet it is in the neighborhood of the invalides father gillenormand had seated himself with a beaming countenance beside marius as he listened to him and drank in the sound of his voice he enjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff at the words rue plumet he interrupted his inhalation and allowed the remainder of his snuff to fall upon his knees the rue plumet the rue plumet did you say let us see are there not barracks in that vicinity why yes that's it your cousin theodule has spoken to me about it the lancer the officer
1513,a gay girl my good friend a gay girl pardieu yes the rue plumet it is what used to be called the rue blomet it all comes back to me now i have heard of that little girl of the iron railing in the rue plumet in a garden a pamela your taste is not bad she is said to be a very tidy creature between ourselves i think that simpleton of a lancer has been courting her a bit i don't know where he did it however that's not to the purpose besides he is not to be believed he brags marius i think it quite proper that a young man like you should be in love it's the right thing at your age i like you better as a lover than as a jacobin i like you better in love with a petticoat sapristi with twenty petticoats than with m de robespierre for my part i will do myself the justice to say that in the line of sans culottes i have never loved any one but women pretty girls are pretty girls the deuce there's no objection to that as for the little one she receives you
1514,without her father's knowledge that's in the established order of things i have had adventures of that same sort myself more than one do you know what is done then one does not take the matter ferociously one does not precipitate himself into the tragic one does not make one's mind to marriage and m le maire with his scarf one simply behaves like a fellow of spirit one shows good sense slip along mortals don't marry you come and look up your grandfather who is a good natured fellow at bottom and who always has a few rolls of louis in an old drawer you say to him see here grandfather and the grandfather says that's a simple matter youth must amuse itself and old age must wear out i have been young you will be old come my boy you shall pass it on to your grandson here are two hundred pistoles amuse yourself deuce take it nothing better that's the way the affair should be treated you don't marry but that does no harm you understand me marius petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable made a sign with his head that he did not the old
1515,man burst out laughing winked his aged eye gave him a slap on the knee stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming air and said to him with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder booby make her your mistress marius turned pale he had understood nothing of what his grandfather had just said this twaddle about the rue blomet pamela the barracks the lancer had passed before marius like a dissolving view nothing of all that could bear any reference to cosette who was a lily the good man was wandering in his mind but this wandering terminated in words which marius did understand and which were a mortal insult to cosette those words make her your mistress entered the heart of the strict young man like a sword he rose picked up his hat which lay on the floor and walked to the door with a firm assured step there he turned round bowed deeply to his grandfather raised his head erect again and said five years ago you insulted my father to day you have insulted my wife i ask nothing more of you sir farewell father gillenormand utterly confounded opened his mouth
1516,extended his arms tried to rise and before he could utter a word the door closed once more and marius had disappeared the old man remained for several minutes motionless and as though struck by lightning without the power to speak or breathe as though a clenched fist grasped his throat at last he tore himself from his arm chair ran so far as a man can run at ninety one to the door opened it and cried help help his daughter made her appearance then the domestics he began again with a pitiful rattle run after him bring him back what have i done to him he is mad he is going away ah my god ah my god this time he will not come back he went to the window which looked out on the street threw it open with his aged and palsied hands leaned out more than half way while basque and nicolette held him behind and shouted marius marius marius marius but marius could no longer hear him for at that moment he was turning the corner of the rue saint louis the octogenarian raised his hands to his temples two or three times with
1517,an expression of anguish recoiled tottering and fell back into an arm chair pulseless voiceless tearless with quivering head and lips which moved with a stupid air with nothing in his eyes and nothing any longer in his heart except a gloomy and profound something which resembled night ninth whither are they going i jean valjean that same day towards four o'clock in the afternoon jean valjean was sitting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary slopes in the champ de mars either from prudence or from a desire to meditate or simply in consequence of one of those insensible changes of habit which gradually introduce themselves into the existence of every one he now rarely went out with cosette he had on his workman's waistcoat and trousers of gray linen and his long visored cap concealed his countenance he was calm and happy now beside cosette that which had for a time alarmed and troubled him had been dissipated but for the last week or two anxieties of another nature had come up one day while walking on the boulevard he had caught sight of thenardier thanks to his disguise thenardier had not recognized him
1518,but since that day jean valjean had seen him repeatedly and he was now certain that thenardier was prowling about in their neighborhood this had been sufficient to make him come to a decision moreover paris was not tranquil political troubles presented this inconvenient feature for any one who had anything to conceal in his life that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious and that while seeking to ferret out a man like pepin or morey they might very readily discover a man like jean valjean jean valjean had made up his mind to quit paris and even france and go over to england he had warned cosette he wished to set out before the end of the week he had seated himself on the slope in the champ de mars turning over all sorts of thoughts in his mind thenardier the police the journey and the difficulty of procuring a passport he was troubled from all these points of view last of all an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his attention and from which he had not yet recovered had added to his state of alarm on the morning of that very day when he
1519,alone of the household was stirring while strolling in the garden before cosette's shutters were open he had suddenly perceived on the wall the following line engraved probably with a nail rue de la verrerie this was perfectly fresh the grooves in the ancient black mortar were white a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with the fine fresh plaster this had probably been written on the preceding night what was this a signal for others a warning for himself in any case it was evident that the garden had been violated and that strangers had made their way into it he recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household his mind was now filling in this canvas he took good care not to speak to cosette of the line written on the wall for fear of alarming her in the midst of his preoccupations he perceived from a shadow cast by the sun that some one had halted on the crest of the slope immediately behind him he was on the point of turning round when a paper folded in four fell upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it
1520,over his head he took the paper unfolded it and read these words written in large characters with a pencil move away from your house jean valjean sprang hastily to his feet there was no one on the slope he gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a child not so large as a man clad in a gray blouse and trousers of dust colored cotton velvet who was jumping over the parapet and who slipped into the moat of the champde mars jean valjean returned home at once in a very thoughtful mood ii marius marius had left m gillenormand in despair he had entered the house with very little hope and quitted it with immense despair however and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will understand this the officer the lancer the ninny cousin theodule had left no trace in his mind not the slightest the dramatic poet might apparently expect some complications from this revelation made point blank by the grandfather to the grandson but what the drama would gain thereby truth would lose marius was at an age when one believes nothing in the line of evil later on
1521,comes the age when one believes everything suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles early youth has none of them that which overwhelmed othello glides innocuous over candide suspect cosette there are hosts of crimes which marius could sooner have committed he began to wander about the streets the resource of those who suffer he thought of nothing so far as he could afterwards remember at two o'clock in the morning he returned to courfeyrac's quarters and flung himself without undressing on his mattress the sun was shining brightly when he sank into that frightful leaden slumber which permits ideas to go and come in the brain when he awoke he saw courfeyrac enjolras feuilly and combeferre standing in the room with their hats on and all ready to go out courfeyrac said to him are you coming to general lamarque's funeral it seemed to him that courfeyrac was speaking chinese he went out some time after them he put in his pocket the pistols which javert had given him at the time of the adventure on the d of february and which had remained in his hands these pistols were still loaded it would be difficult to say what vague
1522,thought he had in his mind when he took them with him all day long he prowled about without knowing where he was going it rained at times he did not perceive it for his dinner he purchased a penny roll at a baker's put it in his pocket and forgot it it appears that he took a bath in the seine without being aware of it there are moments when a man has a furnace within his skull marius was passing through one of those moments he no longer hoped for anything this step he had taken since the preceding evening he waited for night with feverish impatience he had but one idea clearly before his mind this was that at nine o'clock he should see cosette this last happiness now constituted his whole future after that gloom at intervals as he roamed through the most deserted boulevards it seemed to him that he heard strange noises in paris he thrust his head out of his revery and said is there fighting on hand at nightfall at nine o'clock precisely as he had promised cosette he was in the rue plumet when he approached the grating he forgot everything
1523,it was forty eight hours since he had seen cosette he was about to behold her once more every other thought was effaced and he felt only a profound and unheard of joy those minutes in which one lives centuries always have this sovereign and wonderful property that at the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely marius displaced the bar and rushed headlong into the garden cosette was not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him he traversed the thicket and approached the recess near the flight of steps she is waiting for me there said he cosette was not there he raised his eyes and saw that the shutters of the house were closed he made the tour of the garden the garden was deserted then he returned to the house and rendered senseless by love intoxicated terrified exasperated with grief and uneasiness like a master who returns home at an evil hour he tapped on the shutters he knocked and knocked again at the risk of seeing the window open and her father's gloomy face make its appearance and demand what do you want this was nothing in comparison with what he
1524,dimly caught a glimpse of when he had rapped he lifted up his voice and called cosette cosette he cried cosette he repeated imperiously there was no reply all was over no one in the garden no one in the house marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house which was as black and as silent as a tomb and far more empty he gazed at the stone seat on which he had passed so many adorable hours with cosette then he seated himself on the flight of steps his heart filled with sweetness and resolution he blessed his love in the depths of his thought and he said to himself that since cosette was gone all that there was left for him was to die all at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street and which was calling to him through the trees mr marius he started to his feet hey said he mr marius are you there yes mr marius went on the voice your friends are waiting for you at the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie this voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him it resembled the hoarse rough
1525,voice of eponine marius hastened to the gate thrust aside the movable bar passed his head through the aperture and saw some one who appeared to him to be a young man disappearing at a run into the gloom iii m mabeuf jean valjean's purse was of no use to m mabeuf m mabeuf in his venerable infantile austerity had not accepted the gift of the stars he had not admitted that a star could coin itself into louis d'or he had not divined that what had fallen from heaven had come from gavroche he had taken the purse to the police commissioner of the quarter as a lost article placed by the finder at the disposal of claimants the purse was actually lost it is unnecessary to say that no one claimed it and that it did not succor m mabeuf moreover m mabeuf had continued his downward course his experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the jardin des plantes than in his garden at austerlitz the year before he had owed his housekeeper's wages now as we have seen he owed three quarters of his rent the pawnshop had sold the plates of his flora
1526,after the expiration of thirteen months some coppersmith had made stewpans of them his copper plates gone and being unable to complete even the incomplete copies of his flora which were in his possession he had disposed of the text at a miserable price as waste paper to a second hand bookseller nothing now remained to him of his life's work he set to work to eat up the money for these copies when he saw that this wretched resource was becoming exhausted he gave up his garden and allowed it to run to waste before this a long time before he had given up his two eggs and the morsel of beef which he ate from time to time he dined on bread and potatoes he had sold the last of his furniture then all duplicates of his bedding his clothing and his blankets then his herbariums and prints but he still retained his most precious books many of which were of the greatest rarity among others les quadrins historiques de la bible edition of la concordance des bibles by pierre de besse les marguerites de la marguerite of jean de la haye with a dedication to the queen
1527,of navarre the book de la charge et dignite de l'ambassadeur by the sieur de villiers hotman a florilegium rabbinicum of a tibullus of with this magnificent inscription venetiis in aedibus manutianis and lastly a diogenes laertius printed at lyons in which contained the famous variant of the manuscript thirteenth century of the vatican and those of the two manuscripts of venice and consulted with such fruitful results by henri estienne and all the passages in doric dialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfth century belonging to the naples library m mabeuf never had any fire in his chamber and went to bed at sundown in order not to consume any candles it seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors people avoided him when he went out he perceived the fact the wretchedness of a child interests a mother the wretchedness of a young man interests a young girl the wretchedness of an old man interests no one it is of all distresses the coldest still father mabeuf had not entirely lost his childlike serenity his eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested on his books and he smiled when he gazed at
1528,the diogenes laertius which was a unique copy his bookcase with glass doors was the only piece of furniture which he had kept beyond what was strictly indispensable one day mother plutarque said to him i have no money to buy any dinner what she called dinner was a loaf of bread and four or five potatoes on credit suggested m mabeuf you know well that people refuse me m mabeuf opened his bookcase took a long look at all his books one after another as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze upon them before making a choice then seized one hastily put it in under his arm and went out he returned two hours later without anything under his arm laid thirty sous on the table and said you will get something for dinner from that moment forth mother plutarque saw a sombre veil which was never more lifted descend over the old man's candid face on the following day on the day after and on the day after that it had to be done again m mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin as the second hand dealers perceived that he
1529,was forced to sell they purchased of him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty francs sometimes at those very shops volume by volume the whole library went the same road he said at times but i am eighty as though he cherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end of his days before reaching the end of his books his melancholy increased once however he had a pleasure he had gone out with a robert estienne which he had sold for thirty five sous under the quai malaquais and he returned with an aldus which he had bought for forty sous in the rue des gres i owe five sous he said beaming on mother plutarque that day he had no dinner he belonged to the horticultural society his destitution became known there the president of the society came to see him promised to speak to the minister of agriculture and commerce about him and did so why what exclaimed the minister i should think so an old savant a botanist an inoffensive man something must be done for him on the following day m mabeuf received an invitation to dine with the
1530,minister trembling with joy he showed the letter to mother plutarque we are saved said he on the day appointed he went to the minister's house he perceived that his ragged cravat his long square coat and his waxed shoes astonished the ushers no one spoke to him not even the minister about ten o'clock in the evening while he was still waiting for a word he heard the minister's wife a beautiful woman in a low necked gown whom he had not ventured to approach inquire who is that old gentleman he returned home on foot at midnight in a driving rain storm he had sold an elzevir to pay for a carriage in which to go thither he had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his diogenes laertius every night before he went to bed he knew enough greek to enjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned he had now no other enjoyment several weeks passed all at once mother plutarque fell ill there is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy bread at the baker's and that is having no money to purchase drugs at the apothecary's one
1531,evening the doctor had ordered a very expensive potion and the malady was growing worse a nurse was required m mabeuf opened his bookcase there was nothing there the last volume had taken its departure all that was left to him was diogenes laertius he put this unique copy under his arm and went out it was the th of june he went to the porte saint jacques to royal's successor and returned with one hundred francs he laid the pile of five franc pieces on the old serving woman's nightstand and returned to his chamber without saying a word on the following morning at dawn he seated himself on the overturned post in his garden and he could be seen over the top of the hedge sitting the whole morning motionless with drooping head his eyes vaguely fixed on the withered flower beds it rained at intervals the old man did not seem to perceive the fact in the afternoon extraordinary noises broke out in paris they resembled shots and the clamors of a multitude father mabeuf raised his head he saw a gardener passing and inquired what is it the gardener spade on back replied in the most
1532,unconcerned tone it is the riots what riots yes they are fighting why are they fighting ah good heavens ejaculated the gardener in what direction went on m mabeuf in the neighborhood of the arsenal father mabeuf went to his room took his hat mechanically sought for a book to place under his arm found none said ah truly and went off with a bewildered air tenth the th of june i the surface of the question of what is revolt composed of nothing and of everything of an electricity disengaged little by little of a flame suddenly darting forth of a wandering force of a passing breath this breath encounters heads which speak brains which dream souls which suffer passions which burn wretchedness which howls and bears them away whither at random athwart the state the laws athwart prosperity and the insolence of others irritated convictions embittered enthusiasms agitated indignations instincts of war which have been repressed youthful courage which has been exalted generous blindness curiosity the taste for change the thirst for the unexpected the sentiment which causes one to take pleasure in reading the posters for the new play and love the prompter's whistle at the theatre
1533,the vague hatreds rancors disappointments every vanity which thinks that destiny has bankrupted it discomfort empty dreams ambitious that are hedged about whoever hopes for a downfall some outcome in short at the very bottom the rabble that mud which catches fire such are the elements of revolt that which is grandest and that which is basest the beings who prowl outside of all bounds awaiting an occasion bohemians vagrants vagabonds of the cross roads those who sleep at night in a desert of houses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven those who each day demand their bread from chance and not from toil the unknown of poverty and nothingness the bare armed the bare footed belong to revolt whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt against any deed whatever on the part of the state of life or of fate is ripe for riot and as soon as it makes its appearance he begins to quiver and to feel himself borne away with the whirlwind revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms suddenly in certain conditions of temperature and which as it eddies about mounts descends thunders tears razes

1538,parts we reject this word uprisings as too large and consequently as too convenient we make a distinction between one popular movement and another popular movement we do not inquire whether an uprising costs as much as a battle why a battle in the first place here the question of war comes up is war less of a scourge than an uprising is of a calamity and then are all uprisings calamities and what if the revolt of july did cost a hundred and twenty millions the establishment of philip v in spain cost france two milliards even at the same price we should prefer the th of july however we reject these figures which appear to be reasons and which are only words an uprising being given we examine it by itself in all that is said by the doctrinarian objection above presented there is no question of anything but effect we seek the cause we will be explicit ii the root of the matter there is such a thing as an uprising and there is such a thing as insurrection these are two separate phases of wrath one is in the wrong the other is in the right
1539,in democratic states the only ones which are founded on justice it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may proceed as far as resort to arms in all questions which result from collective sovereignty the war of the whole against the fraction is insurrection the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt according as the tuileries contain a king or the convention they are justly or unjustly attacked the same cannon pointed against the populace is wrong on the th of august and right on the th of vendemiaire alike in appearance fundamentally different in reality the swiss defend the false bonaparte defends the true that which universal suffrage has effected in its liberty and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street it is the same in things pertaining purely to civilization the instinct of the masses clear sighted to day may be troubled to morrow the same fury legitimate when directed against terray and absurd when directed against turgot the destruction of machines the pillage of warehouses the breaking of rails the demolition of docks the false routes of multitudes the refusal by the

1542,louis xiv is insurrection hebert against danton is revolt hence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be as lafayette says the most holy of duties an uprising may be the most fatal of crimes there is also a difference in the intensity of heat insurrection is often a volcano revolt is often only a fire of straw revolt as we have said is sometimes found among those in power polignac is a rioter camille desmoulins is one of the governing powers insurrection is sometimes resurrection the solution of everything by universal suffrage being an absolutely modern fact and all history anterior to this fact being for the space of four thousand years filled with violated right and the suffering of peoples each epoch of history brings with it that protest of which it is capable under the caesars there was no insurrection but there was juvenal the facit indignatio replaces the gracchi under the caesars there is the exile to syene there is also the man of the annales we do not speak of the immense exile of patmos who on his part also overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of the ideal
1543,world who makes of his vision an enormous satire and casts on rome nineveh on rome babylon on rome sodom the flaming reflection of the apocalypse john on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal we may understand him he is a jew and it is hebrew but the man who writes the annales is of the latin race let us rather say he is a roman as the neros reign in a black way they should be painted to match the work of the graving tool alone would be too pale there must be poured into the channel a concentrated prose which bites despots count for something in the question of philosophers a word that is chained is a terrible word the writer doubles and trebles his style when silence is imposed on a nation by its master from this silence there arises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into thought and there congeals into bronze the compression of history produces conciseness in the historian the granite solidity of such and such a celebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which are augmentations of force the
1544,ciceronian period which hardly sufficed for verres would be blunted on caligula the less spread of sail in the phrase the more intensity in the blow tacitus thinks with all his might the honesty of a great heart condensed in justice and truth overwhelms as with lightning be it remarked in passing that tacitus is not historically superposed upon caesar the tiberii were reserved for him caesar and tacitus are two successive phenomena a meeting between whom seems to be mysteriously avoided by the one who when he sets the centuries on the stage regulates the entrances and the exits caesar is great tacitus is great god spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to clash with one another the guardian of justice in striking caesar might strike too hard and be unjust god does not will it the great wars of africa and spain the pirates of sicily destroyed civilization introduced into gaul into britanny into germany all this glory covers the rubicon there is here a sort of delicacy of the divine justice hesitating to let loose upon the illustrious usurper the formidable historian sparing caesar tacitus and according extenuating circumstances to genius certainly despotism remains despotism
1545,even under the despot of genius there is corruption under all illustrious tyrants but the moral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants in such reigns nothing veils the shame and those who make examples tacitus as well as juvenal slap this ignominy which cannot reply in the face more usefully in the presence of all humanity rome smells worse under vitellius than under sylla under claudius and under domitian there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the repulsiveness of the tyrant the villainy of slaves is a direct product of the despot a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein the master is reflected public powers are unclean hearts are small consciences are dull souls are like vermin thus it is under caracalla thus it is under commodus thus it is under heliogabalus while from the roman senate under caesar there comes nothing but the odor of the dung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles hence the advent apparently tardy of the tacituses and the juvenals it is in the hour for evidence that the demonstrator makes his appearance but juvenal and tacitus like isaiah in biblical times like dante in the middle ages
1546,is man riot and insurrection are the multitude which is sometimes right and sometimes wrong in the majority of cases riot proceeds from a material fact insurrection is always a moral phenomenon riot is masaniello insurrection spartacus insurrection borders on mind riot on the stomach gaster grows irritated but gaster assuredly is not always in the wrong in questions of famine riot buzancais for example holds a true pathetic and just point of departure nevertheless it remains a riot why it is because right at bottom it was wrong in form shy although in the right violent although strong it struck at random it walked like a blind elephant it left behind it the corpses of old men of women and of children it wished the blood of inoffensive and innocent persons without knowing why the nourishment of the people is a good object to massacre them is a bad means all armed protests even the most legitimate even that of the th of august even that of july th begin with the same troubles before the right gets set free there is foam and tumult in the beginning the insurrection is a riot just as a river is a
1547,torrent ordinarily it ends in that ocean revolution sometimes however coming from those lofty mountains which dominate the moral horizon justice wisdom reason right formed of the pure snow of the ideal after a long fall from rock to rock after having reflected the sky in its transparency and increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph insurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire as the rhine is in a swamp all this is of the past the future is another thing universal suffrage has this admirable property that it dissolves riot in its inception and by giving the vote to insurrection it deprives it of its arms the disappearance of wars of street wars as well as of wars on the frontiers such is the inevitable progression whatever to day may be to morrow will be peace however insurrection riot and points of difference between the former and the latter the bourgeois properly speaking knows nothing of such shades in his mind all is sedition rebellion pure and simple the revolt of the dog against his master an attempt to bite whom must be punished by the chain and the kennel barking snapping until such day
1548,as the head of the dog suddenly enlarged is outlined vaguely in the gloom face to face with the lion then the bourgeois shouts long live the people this explanation given what does the movement of june signify so far as history is concerned is it a revolt is it an insurrection it may happen to us in placing this formidable event on the stage to say revolt now and then but merely to distinguish superficial facts and always preserving the distinction between revolt the form and insurrection the foundation this movement of had in its rapid outbreak and in its melancholy extinction so much grandeur that even those who see in it only an uprising never refer to it otherwise than with respect for them it is like a relic of excited imaginations say they are not to be calmed in a day a revolution cannot be cut off short it must needs undergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest like a mountain sinking into the plain there are no alps without their jura nor pyrenees without the asturias this pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of parisians calls the epoch of the
1549,riots is certainly a characteristic hour amid the stormy hours of this century a last word before we enter on the recital the facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and living reality which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time and space there nevertheless we insist upon it is life palpitation human tremor petty details as we think we have already said are so to speak the foliage of great events and are lost in the distance of history the epoch surnamed of the riots abounds in details of this nature judicial inquiries have not revealed and perhaps have not sounded the depths for another reason than history we shall therefore bring to light among the known and published peculiarities things which have not heretofore been known about facts over which have passed the forgetfulness of some and the death of others the majority of the actors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared beginning with the very next day they held their peace but of what we shall relate we shall be able to say we have seen this we alter a few names for history relates and does not inform against but the
1550,deed which we shall paint will be genuine in accordance with the conditions of the book which we are now writing we shall show only one side and one episode and certainly the least known at that of the two days the th and the th of june but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch a glimpse beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift of the real form of this frightful public adventure iii a burial an occasion to be born again in the spring of although the cholera had been chilling all minds for the last three months and had cast over their agitation an indescribable and gloomy pacification paris had already long been ripe for commotion as we have said the great city resembles a piece of artillery when it is loaded it suffices for a spark to fall and the shot is discharged in june the spark was the death of general lamarque lamarque was a man of renown and of action he had had in succession under the empire and under the restoration the sorts of bravery requisite for the two epochs the bravery of the battle
1551,field and the bravery of the tribune he was as eloquent as he had been valiant a sword was discernible in his speech like foy his predecessor after upholding the command he upheld liberty he sat between the left and the extreme left beloved of the people because he accepted the chances of the future beloved of the populace because he had served the emperor well he was in company with comtes gerard and drouet one of napoleon's marshals in petto the treaties of removed him as a personal offence he hated wellington with a downright hatred which pleased the multitude and for seventeen years he majestically preserved the sadness of waterloo paying hardly any attention to intervening events in his death agony at his last hour he clasped to his breast a sword which had been presented to him by the officers of the hundred days napoleon had died uttering the word army lamarque uttering the word country his death which was expected was dreaded by the people as a loss and by the government as an occasion this death was an affliction like everything that is bitter affliction may turn to revolt this is what took place on
1552,the preceding evening and on the morning of the th of june the day appointed for lamarque's burial the faubourg saint antoine which the procession was to touch at assumed a formidable aspect this tumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors they armed themselves as best they might joiners carried off door weights of their establishment to break down doors one of them had made himself a dagger of a stocking weaver's hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the stump another who was in a fever to attack slept wholly dressed for three days a carpenter named lombier met a comrade who asked him whither are you going eh well i have no weapons what then i'm going to my timber yard to get my compasses what for i don't know said lombier a certain jacqueline an expeditious man accosted some passing artisans come here you he treated them to ten sous worth of wine and said have you work no go to filspierre between the barriere charonne and the barriere montreuil and you will find work at filspierre's they found cartridges and arms certain well known leaders were going the rounds that is to say running
1553,from one house to another to collect their men at barthelemy's near the barriere du trone at capel's near the petit chapeau the drinkers accosted each other with a grave air they were heard to say have you your pistol under my blouse and you under my shirt in the rue traversiere in front of the bland workshop and in the yard of the maison brulee in front of tool maker bernier's groups whispered together among them was observed a certain mavot who never remained more than a week in one shop as the masters always discharged him because they were obliged to dispute with him every day mavot was killed on the following day at the barricade of the rue menilmontant pretot who was destined to perish also in the struggle seconded mavot and to the question what is your object he replied insurrection workmen assembled at the corner of the rue de bercy waited for a certain lemarin the revolutionary agent for the faubourg saint marceau watchwords were exchanged almost publicly on the th of june accordingly a day of mingled rain and sun general lamarque's funeral procession traversed paris with official military pomp somewhat augmented through precaution
1554,two battalions with draped drums and reversed arms ten thousand national guards with their swords at their sides escorted the coffin the hearse was drawn by young men the officers of the invalides came immediately behind it bearing laurel branches then came an innumerable strange agitated multitude the sectionaries of the friends of the people the law school the medical school refugees of all nationalities and spanish italian german and polish flags tricolored horizontal banners every possible sort of banner children waving green boughs stone cutters and carpenters who were on strike at the moment printers who were recognizable by their paper caps marching two by two three by three uttering cries nearly all of them brandishing sticks some brandishing sabres without order and yet with a single soul now a tumultuous rout again a column squads chose themselves leaders a man armed with a pair of pistols in full view seemed to pass the host in review and the files separated before him on the side alleys of the boulevards in the branches of the trees on balconies in windows on the roofs swarmed the heads of men women and children all eyes were filled with anxiety an armed
1555,throng was passing and a terrified throng looked on the government on its side was taking observations it observed with its hand on its sword four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in the place louis xv in their saddles with their trumpets at their head cartridge boxes filled and muskets loaded all in readiness to march in the latin country and at the jardin des plantes the municipal guard echelonned from street to street at the halle aux vins a squadron of dragoons at the greve half of the th light infantry the other half being at the bastille the th dragoons at the celestins and the courtyard of the louvre full of artillery the remainder of the troops were confined to their barracks without reckoning the regiments of the environs of paris power being uneasy held suspended over the menacing multitude twenty four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand in the banlieue divers reports were in circulation in the cortege legitimist tricks were hinted at they spoke of the duc de reichstadt whom god had marked out for death at that very moment when the populace were designating him for the empire one personage whose name
1556,has remained unknown announced that at a given hour two overseers who had been won over would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people that which predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of those present was enthusiasm mingled with dejection here and there also in that multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions there were visible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble mouths which said let us plunder there are certain agitations which stir up the bottoms of marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water a phenomenon to which well drilled policemen are no strangers the procession proceeded with feverish slowness from the house of the deceased by way of the boulevards as far as the bastille it rained from time to time the rain mattered nothing to that throng many incidents the coffin borne round the vendome column stones thrown at the duc de fitz james who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his head the gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire a policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the porte saint martin an officer
1557,of the th light infantry saying aloud i am a republican the polytechnic school coming up unexpectedly against orders to remain at home the shouts of long live the polytechnique long live the republic marked the passage of the funeral train at the bastille long files of curious and formidable people who descended from the faubourg saint antoine effected a junction with the procession and a certain terrible seething began to agitate the throng one man was heard to say to another do you see that fellow with a red beard he's the one who will give the word when we are to fire it appears that this red beard was present at another riot the quenisset affair entrusted with this same function the hearse passed the bastille traversed the small bridge and reached the esplanade of the bridge of austerlitz there it halted the crowd surveyed at that moment with a bird'seye view would have presented the aspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail spread out over the quai bourdon covered the bastille and was prolonged on the boulevard as far as the porte saint martin a circle was traced around the hearse
1558,the vast rout held their peace lafayette spoke and bade lamarque farewell this was a touching and august instant all heads uncovered all hearts beat high all at once a man on horseback clad in black made his appearance in the middle of the group with a red flag others say with a pike surmounted with a red liberty cap lafayette turned aside his head exelmans quitted the procession this red flag raised a storm and disappeared in the midst of it from the boulevard bourdon to the bridge of austerlitz one of those clamors which resemble billows stirred the multitude two prodigious shouts went up lamarque to the pantheon lafayette to the town hall some young men amid the declamations of the throng harnessed themselves and began to drag lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of austerlitz and lafayette in a hackney coach along the quai morland in the crowd which surrounded and cheered lafayette it was noticed that a german showed himself named ludwig snyder who died a centenarian afterwards who had also been in the war of and who had fought at trenton under washington and at brandywine under lafayette in the meantime the municipal cavalry
1559,on the left bank had been set in motion and came to bar the bridge on the right bank the dragoons emerged from the celestins and deployed along the quai morland the men who were dragging lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner of the quay and shouted the dragoons the dragoons advanced at a walk in silence with their pistols in their holsters their swords in their scabbards their guns slung in their leather sockets with an air of gloomy expectation they halted two hundred paces from the little bridge the carriage in which sat lafayette advanced to them their ranks opened and allowed it to pass and then closed behind it at that moment the dragoons and the crowd touched the women fled in terror what took place during that fatal minute no one can say it is the dark moment when two clouds come together some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge was heard in the direction of the arsenal others that a blow from a dagger was given by a child to a dragoon the fact is that three shots were suddenly discharged the first killed cholet chief of the squadron
1560,the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her window the third singed the shoulder of an officer a woman screamed they are beginning too soon and all at once a squadron of dragoons which had remained in the barracks up to this time was seen to debouch at a gallop with bared swords through the rue bassompierre and the boulevard bourdon sweeping all before them then all is said the tempest is loosed stones rain down a fusillade breaks forth many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank and pass the small arm of the seine now filled in the timber yards of the isle louviers that vast citadel ready to hand bristle with combatants stakes are torn up pistol shots fired a barricade begun the young men who are thrust back pass the austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run and the municipal guard the carabineers rush up the dragoons ply their swords the crowd disperses in all directions a rumor of war flies to all four quarters of paris men shout to arms they run tumble down flee resist wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire
1561,iv the ebullitions of former days nothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot everything bursts forth everywhere at once was it foreseen yes was it prepared no whence comes it from the pavements whence falls it from the clouds here insurrection assumes the character of a plot there of an improvisation the first comer seizes a current of the throng and leads it whither he wills a beginning full of terror in which is mingled a sort of formidable gayety first come clamors the shops are closed the displays of the merchants disappear then come isolated shots people flee blows from gun stocks beat against portes cocheres servants can be heard laughing in the courtyards of houses and saying there's going to be a row a quarter of an hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking place at twenty different spots in paris at once in the rue sainte croix de la bretonnerie twenty young men bearded and with long hair entered a dram shop and emerged a moment later carrying a horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape and having at their head three men armed one with a sword one with
1562,a gun and the third with a pike in the rue des nonaindieres a very well dressed bourgeois who had a prominent belly a sonorous voice a bald head a lofty brow a black beard and one of these stiff mustaches which will not lie flat offered cartridges publicly to passers by in the rue saint pierre montmartre men with bare arms carried about a black flag on which could be read in white letters this inscription republic or death in the rue des jeuneurs rue du cadran rue montorgueil rue mandar groups appeared waving flags on which could be distinguished in gold letters the word section with a number one of these flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of white between they pillaged a factory of small arms on the boulevard saint martin and three armorers shops the first in the rue beaubourg the second in the rue michel le comte the other in the rue du temple in a few minutes the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred and thirty guns nearly all double barrelled sixty four swords and eighty three pistols in order to provide more arms
1563,one man took the gun the other the bayonet opposite the quai de la greve young men armed with muskets installed themselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing one of them had a flint lock they rang entered and set about making cartridges one of these women relates i did not know what cartridges were it was my husband who told me one cluster broke into a curiosity shop in the rue des vielles haudriettes and seized yataghans and turkish arms the body of a mason who had been killed by a gun shot lay in the rue de la perle and then on the right bank the left bank on the quays on the boulevards in the latin country in the quarter of the halles panting men artisans students members of sections read proclamations and shouted to arms broke street lanterns unharnessed carriages unpaved the streets broke in the doors of houses uprooted trees rummaged cellars rolled out hogsheads heaped up paving stones rough slabs furniture and planks and made barricades they forced the bourgeois to assist them in this they entered the dwellings of women they forced them to hand over the swords
1564,and guns of their absent husbands and they wrote on the door with whiting the arms have been delivered some signed their names to receipts for the guns and swords and said send for them to morrow at the mayor's office they disarmed isolated sentinels and national guardsmen in the streets on their way to the townhall they tore the epaulets from officers in the rue du cimitiere saint nicholas an officer of the national guard on being pursued by a crowd armed with clubs and foils took refuge with difficulty in a house whence he was only able to emerge at nightfall and in disguise in the quartier saint jacques the students swarmed out of their hotels and ascended the rue saint hyacinthe to the cafe du progress or descended to the cafe des sept billards in the rue des mathurins there in front of the door young men mounted on the stone corner posts distributed arms they plundered the timber yard in the rue transnonain in order to obtain material for barricades on a single point the inhabitants resisted at the corner of the rue sainte avoye and the rue simon le franc where they destroyed the barricade
1565,with their own hands at a single point the insurgents yielded they abandoned a barricade begun in the rue de temple after having fired on a detachment of the national guard and fled through the rue de la corderie the detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag a package of cartridges and three hundred pistol balls the national guardsmen tore up the flag and carried off its tattered remains on the points of their bayonets all that we are here relating slowly and successively took place simultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult like a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder in less than an hour twenty seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter of the halles alone in the centre was that famous house no which was the fortress of jeanne and her six hundred companions and which flanked on the one hand by a barricade at saint merry and on the other by a barricade of the rue maubuee commanded three streets the rue des arcis the rue saint martin and the rue aubry le boucher which it faced the barricades at
1566,right angles fell back the one of the rue montorgueil on the grande truanderie the other of the rue geoffroy langevin on the rue sainte avoye without reckoning innumerable barricades in twenty other quarters of paris in the marais at mont sainte genevieve one in the rue menilmontant where was visible a porte cochere torn from its hinges another near the little bridge of the hotel dieu made with an ecossais which had been unharnessed and overthrown three hundred paces from the prefecture of police at the barricade of the rue des menetriers a well dressed man distributed money to the workmen at the barricade of the rue grenetat a horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be the commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of silver here said he this is to pay expenses wine et caetera a light haired young man without a cravat went from barricade to barricade carrying pass words another with a naked sword a blue police cap on his head placed sentinels in the interior beyond the barricades the wine shops and porters lodges were converted into guard houses otherwise the riot was conducted
1567,after the most scientific military tactics the narrow uneven sinuous streets full of angles and turns were admirably chosen the neighborhood of the halles in particular a network of streets more intricate than a forest the society of the friends of the people had it was said undertaken to direct the insurrection in the quartier sainte avoye a man killed in the rue du ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of paris that which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a sort of strange impetuosity which was in the air the insurrection had abruptly built barricades with one hand and with the other seized nearly all the posts of the garrison in less than three hours like a train of powder catching fire the insurgents had invaded and occupied on the right bank the arsenal the mayoralty of the place royale the whole of the marais the popincourt arms manufactory la galiote the chateau d'eau and all the streets near the halles on the left bank the barracks of the veterans sainte pelagie the place maubert the powder magazine of the deux moulins and all the barriers at five o'clock in the evening
1568,they were masters of the bastille of the lingerie of the blancs manteaux their scouts had reached the place des victoires and menaced the bank the petits peres barracks and the post office a third of paris was in the hands of the rioters the conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points and as a result of the disarming domiciliary visits and armorers shops hastily invaded was that the combat which had begun with the throwing of stones was continued with gun shots about six o'clock in the evening the passage du saumon became the field of battle the uprising was at one end the troops were at the other they fired from one gate to the other an observer a dreamer the author of this book who had gone to get a near view of this volcano found himself in the passage between the two fires all that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half columns which separate the shops he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour meanwhile the call to arms was beaten the national guard armed in haste the legions emerged
1569,from the mayoralities the regiments from their barracks opposite the passage de l'ancre a drummer received a blow from a dagger another in the rue du cygne was assailed by thirty young men who broke his instrument and took away his sword another was killed in the rue grenier saint lazare in the rue michelle comte three officers fell dead one after the other many of the municipal guards on being wounded in the rue des lombards retreated in front of the cour batave a detachment of national guards found a red flag bearing the following inscription republican revolution no was this a revolution in fact the insurrection had made of the centre of paris a sort of inextricable tortuous colossal citadel there was the hearth there evidently was the question all the rest was nothing but skirmishes the proof that all would be decided there lay in the fact that there was no fighting going on there as yet in some regiments the soldiers were uncertain which added to the fearful uncertainty of the crisis they recalled the popular ovation which had greeted the neutrality of the d of the line in july two intrepid men tried in great
1570,wars the marshal lobau and general bugeaud were in command bugeaud under lobau enormous patrols composed of battalions of the line enclosed in entire companies of the national guard and preceded by a commissary of police wearing his scarf of office went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion the insurgents on their side placed videttes at the corners of all open spaces and audaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades each side was watching the other the government with an army in its hand hesitated the night was almost upon them and the saint merry tocsin began to make itself heard the minister of war at that time marshal soult who had seen austerlitz regarded this with a gloomy air these old sailors accustomed to correct manoeuvres and having as resource and guide only tactics that compass of battles are utterly disconcerted in the presence of that immense foam which is called public wrath the national guards of the suburbs rushed up in haste and disorder a battalion of the th light came at a run from saint denis the th of the line arrived from courbevoie the batteries of the military school had taken up their position on the
1571,carrousel cannons were descending from vincennes solitude was formed around the tuileries louis philippe was perfectly serene v originality of paris during the last two years as we have said paris had witnessed more than one insurrection nothing is generally more singularly calm than the physiognomy of paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the rebellious quarters paris very speedily accustoms herself to anything it is only a riot and paris has so many affairs on hand that she does not put herself out for so small a matter these colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles these immense enclosures alone can contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable tranquillity ordinarily when an insurrection commences when the shop keeper hears the drum the call to arms the general alarm he contents himself with the remark there appears to be a squabble in the rue saint martin or in the faubourg saint antoine often he adds carelessly or somewhere in that direction later on when the heart rending and mournful hubbub of musketry and firing by platoons becomes audible the shopkeeper says it's getting hot hullo it's getting hot a moment later the riot approaches
1572,and gains in force he shuts up his shop precipitately hastily dons his uniform that is to say he places his merchandise in safety and risks his own person men fire in a square in a passage in a blind alley they take and re take the barricade blood flows the grape shot riddles the fronts of the houses the balls kill people in their beds corpses encumber the streets a few streets away the shock of billiard balls can be heard in the cafes the theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles the curious laugh and chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with war hackney carriages go their way passers by are going to a dinner somewhere in town sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is going on in a fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass at the time of the insurrection of in the rue saint martin a little infirm old man pushing a hand cart surmounted by a tricolored rag in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid went and came from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade offering his glasses
1573,of cocoa impartially now to the government now to anarchy nothing can be stranger and this is the peculiar character of uprisings in paris which cannot be found in any other capital to this end two things are requisite the size of paris and its gayety the city of voltaire and napoleon is necessary on this occasion however in the resort to arms of june th the great city felt something which was perhaps stronger than itself it was afraid closed doors windows and shutters were to be seen everywhere in the most distant and most disinterested quarters the courageous took to arms the poltroons hid the busy and heedless passer by disappeared many streets were empty at four o'clock in the morning alarming details were hawked about fatal news was disseminated that they were masters of the bank that there were six hundred of them in the cloister of saint merry alone entrenched and embattled in the church that the line was not to be depended on that armand carrel had been to see marshal clausel and that the marshal had said get a regiment first that lafayette was ill but that he had said to them nevertheless i
1574,am with you i will follow you wherever there is room for a chair that one must be on one's guard that at night there would be people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of paris there the imagination of the police that anne radcliffe mixed up with the government was recognizable that a battery had been established in the rue aubry le boucher that lobau and bugeaud were putting their heads together and that at midnight or at daybreak at latest four columns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising the first coming from the bastille the second from the porte saint martin the third from the greve the fourth from the halles that perhaps also the troops would evacuate paris and withdraw to the champ de mars that no one knew what would happen but that this time it certainly was serious people busied themselves over marshal soult's hesitations why did not he attack at once it is certain that he was profoundly absorbed the old lion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom evening came the theatres did not open the patrols circulated with an air of irritation passers by were searched
1575,suspicious persons were arrested by nine o'clock more than eight hundred persons had been arrested the prefecture of police was encumbered with them so was the conciergerie so was la force at the conciergerie in particular the long vault which is called the rue de paris was littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heap of prisoners whom the man of lyons lagrange harangued valiantly all that straw rustled by all these men produced the sound of a heavy shower elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows piled on top of each other anxiety reigned everywhere and a certain tremor which was not habitual with paris people barricaded themselves in their houses wives and mothers were uneasy nothing was to be heard but this ah my god he has not come home there was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to be heard people listened on their thresholds to the rumors the shouts the tumult the dull and indistinct sounds to the things that were said it is cavalry or those are the caissons galloping to the trumpets the drums the firing and above all to that lamentable alarm peal from saint merry
1576,they waited for the first cannon shot men sprang up at the corners of the streets and disappeared shouting go home and people made haste to bolt their doors they said how will all this end from moment to moment in proportion as the darkness descended paris seemed to take on a more mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt eleventh the atom fraternizes with the hurricane i some explanations with regard to the origin of gavroche's poetry the influence of an academician on this poetry at the instant when the insurrection arising from the shock of the populace and the military in front of the arsenal started a movement in advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following the hearse and which through the whole length of the boulevards weighed so to speak on the head of the procession there arose a frightful ebb the rout was shaken their ranks were broken all ran fled made their escape some with shouts of attack others with the pallor of flight the great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling overflowed to right and left and spread in torrents over two hundred streets at
1577,once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose at that moment a ragged child who was coming down through the rue menilmontant holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which he had just plucked on the heights of belleville caught sight of an old holster pistol in the show window of a bric a brac merchant's shop mother what's your name i'm going to borrow your machine and off he ran with the pistol two minutes later a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeing through the rue amelot and the rue basse encountered the lad brandishing his pistol and singing la nuit on ne voit rien le jour on voit tres bien d'un ecrit apocrypha le bourgeois s'ebouriffe pratiquez la vertu tutu chapeau pointu it was little gavroche on his way to the wars on the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion we know not who does know himself perhaps however gavroche was well up in all the popular tunes in circulation and he
1578,mingled with them his own chirpings an observing urchin and a rogue he made a potpourri of the voices of nature and the voices of paris he combined the repertory of the birds with the repertory of the workshops he was acquainted with thieves a tribe contiguous to his own he had it appears been for three months apprenticed to a printer he had one day executed a commission for m baour lormian one of the forty gavroche was a gamin of letters moreover gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offered the hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that villainously rainy night it was to his own brothers that he had played the part of providence his brothers in the evening his father in the morning that is what his night had been like on quitting the rue des ballets at daybreak he had returned in haste to the elephant had artistically extracted from it the two brats had shared with them some sort of breakfast which he had invented and had then gone away confiding them to that good mother the street who had brought him up almost entirely on leaving them
1579,he had appointed to meet them at the same spot in the evening and had left them this discourse by way of a farewell i break a cane otherwise expressed i cut my stick or as they say at the court i file off if you don't find papa and mamma young uns come back here this evening i'll scramble you up some supper and i'll give you a shakedown the two children picked up by some policeman and placed in the refuge or stolen by some mountebank or having simply strayed off in that immense chinese puzzle of a paris did not return the lowest depths of the actual social world are full of these lost traces gavroche did not see them again ten or twelve weeks had elapsed since that night more than once he had scratched the back of his head and said where the devil are my two children in the meantime he had arrived pistol in hand in the rue du pont aux choux he noticed that there was but one shop open in that street and a matter worthy of reflection that was a pastry cook's shop this presented a providential occasion to eat
1580,another apple turnover before entering the unknown gavroche halted fumbled in his fob turned his pocket inside out found nothing not even a sou and began to shout help it is hard to miss the last cake nevertheless gavroche pursued his way two minutes later he was in the rue saint louis while traversing the rue du parc royal he felt called upon to make good the loss of the apple turnover which had been impossible and he indulged himself in the immense delight of tearing down the theatre posters in broad daylight a little further on on catching sight of a group of comfortable looking persons who seemed to be landed proprietors he shrugged his shoulders and spit out at random before him this mouthful of philosophical bile as they passed how fat those moneyed men are they're drunk they just wallow in good dinners ask em what they do with their money they don't know they eat it that's what they do as much as their bellies will hold ii gavroche on the march the brandishing of a triggerless pistol grasped in one's hand in the open street is so much of a public function that gavroche felt
1581,his fervor increasing with every moment amid the scraps of the marseillaise which he was singing he shouted all goes well i suffer a great deal in my left paw i'm all broken up with rheumatism but i'm satisfied citizens all that the bourgeois have to do is to bear themselves well i'll sneeze them out subversive couplets what are the police spies dogs and i'd just like to have one of them at the end of my pistol i'm just from the boulevard my friends it's getting hot there it's getting into a little boil it's simmering it's time to skim the pot forward march men let an impure blood inundate the furrows i give my days to my country i shall never see my concubine more nini finished yes nini but never mind long live joy let's fight crebleu i've had enough of despotism at that moment the horse of a lancer of the national guard having fallen gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement and picked up the man then he assisted in raising the horse after which he picked up his pistol and resumed his way in the rue de thorigny all was peace and silence
1582,this apathy peculiar to the marais presented a contrast with the vast surrounding uproar four gossips were chatting in a doorway scotland has trios of witches paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags and the thou shalt be king could be quite as mournfully hurled at bonaparte in the carrefour baudoyer as at macbeth on the heath of armuyr the croak would be almost identical the gossips of the rue de thorigny busied themselves only with their own concerns three of them were portresses and the fourth was a rag picker with her basket on her back all four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age which are decrepitude decay ruin and sadness the rag picker was humble in this open air society it is the rag picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes this is caused by the corner for refuse which is fat or lean according to the will of the portresses and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap there may be kindness in the broom this rag picker was a grateful creature and she smiled with what a smile on the three portresses things of this
1583,nature were said ah by the way is your cat still cross good gracious cats are naturally the enemies of dogs you know it's the dogs who complain and people also but the fleas from a cat don't go after people that's not the trouble dogs are dangerous i remember one year when there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the newspapers that was at the time when there were at the tuileries great sheep that drew the little carriage of the king of rome do you remember the king of rome i liked the duc de bordeau better i knew louis xviii i prefer louis xviii meat is awfully dear isn't it mother patagon ah don't mention it the butcher's shop is a horror a horrible horror one can't afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays here the rag picker interposed ladies business is dull the refuse heaps are miserable no one throws anything away any more they eat everything there are poorer people than you la vargouleme ah that's true replied the rag picker with deference i have a profession a pause succeeded and the rag picker yielding to that necessity for
1584,boasting which lies at the bottom of man added in the morning on my return home i pick over my basket i sort my things this makes heaps in my room i put the rags in a basket the cores and stalks in a bucket the linen in my cupboard the woollen stuff in my commode the old papers in the corner of the window the things that are good to eat in my bowl the bits of glass in my fireplace the old shoes behind my door and the bones under my bed gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening old ladies said he what do you mean by talking politics he was assailed by a broadside composed of a quadruple howl here's another rascal what's that he's got in his paddle a pistol well i'd like to know what sort of a beggar's brat this is that sort of animal is never easy unless he's overturning the authorities gavroche disdainfully contented himself by way of reprisal with elevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide the rag picker cried you malicious bare pawed little wretch the one who answered to the
1585,name of patagon clapped her hands together in horror there's going to be evil doings that's certain the errand boy next door has a little pointed beard i have seen him pass every day with a young person in a pink bonnet on his arm to day i saw him pass and he had a gun on his arm mame bacheux says that last week there was a revolution at at at where's the calf at pontoise and then there you see him that horrid scamp with his pistol it seems that the celestins are full of pistols what do you suppose the government can do with good for nothings who don't know how to do anything but contrive ways of upsetting the world when we had just begun to get a little quiet after all the misfortunes that have happened good lord to that poor queen whom i saw pass in the tumbril and all this is going to make tobacco dearer it's infamous and i shall certainly go to see him beheaded on the guillotine the wretch you've got the sniffles old lady said gavroche blow your promontory and he passed on when he was in the rue
1586,pavee the rag picker occurred to his mind and he indulged in this soliloquy you're in the wrong to insult the revolutionists mother dust heap corner this pistol is in your interests it's so that you may have more good things to eat in your basket all at once he heard a shout behind him it was the portress patagon who had followed him and who was shaking her fist at him in the distance and crying you're nothing but a bastard oh come now said gavroche i don't care a brass farthing for that shortly afterwards he passed the hotel lamoignon there he uttered this appeal forward march to the battle and he was seized with a fit of melancholy he gazed at his pistol with an air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it i'm going off said he but you won't go off one dog may distract the attention from another dog a very gaunt poodle came along at the moment gavroche felt compassion for him my poor doggy said he you must have gone and swallowed a cask for all the hoops are visible then he directed his course towards l'orme saint gervais iii
1587,just indignation of a hair dresser the worthy hair dresser who had chased from his shop the two little fellows to whom gavroche had opened the paternal interior of the elephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving an old soldier of the legion who had served under the empire they were talking the hair dresser had naturally spoken to the veteran of the riot then of general lamarque and from lamarque they had passed to the emperor thence sprang up a conversation between barber and soldier which prudhomme had he been present would have enriched with arabesques and which he would have entitled dialogue between the razor and the sword how did the emperor ride sir said the barber badly he did not know how to fall so he never fell did he have fine horses he must have had fine horses on the day when he gave me my cross i noticed his beast it was a racing mare perfectly white her ears were very wide apart her saddle deep a fine head marked with a black star a very long neck strongly articulated knees prominent ribs oblique shoulders and a powerful crupper a little
1588,more than fifteen hands in height a pretty horse remarked the hair dresser it was his majesty's beast the hair dresser felt that after this observation a short silence would be fitting so he conformed himself to it and then went on the emperor was never wounded but once was he sir the old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who had been there in the heel at ratisbon i never saw him so well dressed as on that day he was as neat as a new sou and you mr veteran you must have been often wounded i said the soldier ah not to amount to anything at marengo i received two sabre blows on the back of my neck a bullet in the right arm at austerlitz another in the left hip at jena at friedland a thrust from a bayonet there at the moskowa seven or eight lance thrusts no matter where at lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed one of my fingers ah and then at waterloo a ball from a biscaien in the thigh that's all how fine that is exclaimed the hair dresser in pindaric accents to die
1589,on the field of battle on my word of honor rather than die in bed of an illness slowly a bit by bit each day with drugs cataplasms syringes medicines i should prefer to receive a cannon ball in my belly you're not over fastidious said the soldier he had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop the show window had suddenly been fractured the wig maker turned pale ah good god he exclaimed it's one of them what a cannon ball here it is said the soldier and he picked up something that was rolling about the floor it was a pebble the hair dresser ran to the broken window and beheld gavroche fleeing at the full speed towards the marche saint jean as he passed the hair dresser's shop gavroche who had the two brats still in his mind had not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him and had flung a stone through his panes you see shrieked the hair dresser who from white had turned blue that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it what has any one done to that gamin iv the child
1590,is amazed at the old man in the meantime in the marche saint jean where the post had already been disarmed gavroche had just effected a junction with a band led by enjolras courfeyrac combeferre and feuilly they were armed after a fashion bahorel and jean prouvaire had found them and swelled the group enjolras had a double barrelled hunting gun combeferre the gun of a national guard bearing the number of his legion and in his belt two pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be seen jean prouvaire an old cavalry musket bahorel a rifle courfeyrac was brandishing an unsheathed sword cane feuilly with a naked sword in his hand marched at their head shouting long live poland they reached the quai morland cravatless hatless breathless soaked by the rain with lightning in their eyes gavroche accosted them calmly where are we going come along said courfeyrac behind feuilly marched or rather bounded bahorel who was like a fish in water in a riot he wore a scarlet waistcoat and indulged in the sort of words which break everything his waistcoat astounded a passer by who cried in bewilderment here are the reds the reds the reds retorted

1592,a start and if i tore down that charge hercle twas only to whet my appetite this word hercle struck gavroche he sought all occasions for learning and that tearer down of posters possessed his esteem he inquired of him what does hercle mean bahorel answered it means cursed name of a dog in latin here bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard who was watching them as they passed probably a friend of the a b c he shouted to him quick cartridges para bellum a fine man that's true said gavroche who now understood latin a tumultuous retinue accompanied them students artists young men affiliated to the cougourde of aix artisans longshoremen armed with clubs and bayonets some like combeferre with pistols thrust into their trousers an old man who appeared to be extremely aged was walking in the band he had no arms and he made great haste so that he might not be left behind although he had a thoughtful air gavroche caught sight of him keksekca said he to courfeyrac he's an old duffer it was m mabeuf v the old man let us recount what had taken place
1593,enjolras and his friends had been on the boulevard bourdon near the public storehouses at the moment when the dragoons had made their charge enjolras courfeyrac and combeferre were among those who had taken to the rue bassompierre shouting to the barricades in the rue lesdiguieres they had met an old man walking along what had attracted their attention was that the goodman was walking in a zig zag as though he were intoxicated moreover he had his hat in his hand although it had been raining all the morning and was raining pretty briskly at the very time courfeyrac had recognized father mabeuf he knew him through having many times accompanied marius as far as his door as he was acquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the old beadle book collector and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst of that uproar a couple of paces from the cavalry charges almost in the midst of a fusillade hatless in the rain and strolling about among the bullets he had accosted him and the following dialogue had been exchanged between the rioter of fire and the octogenarian m mabeuf go to your home
1594,why there's going to be a row that's well thrusts with the sword and firing m mabeuf that is well firing from cannon that is good where are the rest of you going we are going to fling the government to the earth that is good and he had set out to follow them from that moment forth he had not uttered a word his step had suddenly become firm artisans had offered him their arms he had refused with a sign of the head he advanced nearly to the front rank of the column with the movement of a man who is marching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping what a fierce old fellow muttered the students the rumor spread through the troop that he was a former member of the convention an old regicide the mob had turned in through the rue de la verrerie little gavroche marched in front with that deafening song which made of him a sort of trumpet he sang voici la lune qui paratt quand irons nous dans la foret demandait charlot a charlotte tou tou tou pour chatou je n'ai qu'un dieu qu'un roi qu'un liard et qu'une botte

1596,said courfeyrac i have forgotten my purse and i have lost my hat he quitted the mob and ran up to his quarters at full speed he seized an old hat and his purse he also seized a large square coffer of the dimensions of a large valise which was concealed under his soiled linen as he descended again at a run the portress hailed him monsieur de courfeyrac what's your name portress the portress stood bewildered why you know perfectly well i'm the concierge my name is mother veuvain well if you call me monsieur de courfeyrac again i shall call you mother de veuvain now speak what's the matter what do you want there is some one who wants to speak with you who is it i don't know where is he in my lodge the devil ejaculated courfeyrac but the person has been waiting your return for over an hour said the portress at the same time a sort of pale thin small freckled and youthful artisan clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed velvet and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of a man emerged from
1597,the lodge and said to courfeyrac in a voice which was not the least in the world like a woman's voice monsieur marius if you please he is not here will he return this evening i know nothing about it and courfeyrac added for my part i shall not return the young man gazed steadily at him and said why not because where are you going then what business is that of yours would you like to have me carry your coffer for you i am going to the barricades would you like to have me go with you if you like replied courfeyrac the street is free the pavements belong to every one and he made his escape at a run to join his friends when he had rejoined them he gave the coffer to one of them to carry it was only a quarter of an hour after this that he saw the young man who had actually followed them a mob does not go precisely where it intends we have explained that a gust of wind carries it away they overshot saint merry and found themselves without precisely knowing how in the rue saint denis twelfth corinthe
1598,i history of corinthe from its foundation the parisians who nowadays on entering on the rue rambuteau at the end near the halles notice on their right opposite the rue mondetour a basket maker's shop having for its sign a basket in the form of napoleon the great with this inscription napoleon is made wholly of willow have no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed hardly thirty years ago it was there that lay the rue de la chanvrerie which ancient deeds spell chanverrerie and the celebrated public house called corinthe the reader will remember all that has been said about the barricade effected at this point and eclipsed by the way by the barricade saint merry it was on this famous barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie now fallen into profound obscurity that we are about to shed a little light may we be permitted to recur for the sake of clearness in the recital to the simple means which we have already employed in the case of waterloo persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact manner the constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near the pointe
1599,saint eustache at the northeast angle of the halles of paris where to day lies the embouchure of the rue rambuteau have only to imagine an n touching the rue saint denis with its summit and the halles with its base and whose two vertical bars should form the rue de la grande truanderie and the rue de la chanvrerie and whose transverse bar should be formed by the rue de la petite truanderie the old rue mondetour cut the three strokes of the n at the most crooked angles so that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed to form on a space three fathoms square between the halles and the rue saint denis on the one hand and between the rue du cygne and the rue des precheurs on the other seven islands of houses oddly cut up of varying sizes placed crosswise and hap hazard and barely separated like the blocks of stone in a dock by narrow crannies we say narrow crannies and we can give no more just idea of those dark contracted many angled alleys lined with eight story buildings these buildings were so decrepit that in the rue de la chanvrerie and
1600,the rue de la petite truanderie the fronts were shored up with beams running from one house to another the street was narrow and the gutter broad the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet skirting little stalls resembling cellars big posts encircled with iron hoops excessive heaps of refuse and gates armed with enormous century old gratings the rue rambuteau has devastated all that the name of mondetour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of that whole set of streets a little further on they are found still better expressed by the rue pirouette which ran into the rue mondetour the passer by who got entangled from the rue saint denis in the rue de la chanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he had entered an elongated funnel at the end of this street which was very short he found further passage barred in the direction of the halles by a tall row of houses and he would have thought himself in a blind alley had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through which he could make his escape this was the rue mondetour which on one side
1601,ran into the rue de precheurs and on the other into the rue du cygne and the petite truanderie at the bottom of this sort of cul de sac at the angle of the cutting on the right there was to be seen a house which was not so tall as the rest and which formed a sort of cape in the street it is in this house of two stories only that an illustrious wine shop had been merrily installed three hundred years before this tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old theophilus described in the following couplet la branle le squelette horrible d'un pauvre amant qui se pendit the situation was good and tavern keepers succeeded each other there from father to son in the time of mathurin regnier this cabaret was called the pot aux roses and as the rebus was then in fashion it had for its sign board a post poteau painted rose color in the last century the worthy natoire one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by the stiff school having got drunk many times in this wine shop at the very table where regnier had drunk his fill
1602,had painted by way of gratitude a bunch of corinth grapes on the pink post the keeper of the cabaret in his joy had changed his device and had caused to be placed in gilt letters beneath the bunch these words at the bunch of corinth grapes au raisin de corinthe hence the name of corinthe nothing is more natural to drunken men than ellipses the ellipsis is the zig zag of the phrase corinthe gradually dethroned the pot aux roses the last proprietor of the dynasty father hucheloup no longer acquainted even with the tradition had the post painted blue a room on the ground floor where the bar was situated one on the first floor containing a billiard table a wooden spiral staircase piercing the ceiling wine on the tables smoke on the walls candles in broad daylight this was the style of this cabaret a staircase with a trap door in the lower room led to the cellar on the second floor were the lodgings of the hucheloup family they were reached by a staircase which was a ladder rather than a staircase and had for their entrance only a private door in the large room on
1603,the first floor under the roof in two mansard attics were the nests for the servants the kitchen shared the ground floor with the tap room father hucheloup had possibly been born a chemist but the fact is that he was a cook people did not confine themselves to drinking alone in his wine shop they also ate there hucheloup had invented a capital thing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house stuffed carps which he called carpes au gras these were eaten by the light of a tallow candle or of a lamp of the time of louis xvi on tables to which were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of table cloths people came thither from a distance hucheloup one fine morning had seen fit to notify passers by of this specialty he had dipped a brush in a pot of black paint and as he was an orthographer on his own account as well as a cook after his own fashion he had improvised on his wall this remarkable inscription carpes ho gras one winter the rain storms and the showers had taken a fancy to obliterate the s which terminated the first word and the
1604,g which began the third this is what remained carpe ho ras time and rain assisting a humble gastronomical announcement had become a profound piece of advice in this way it came about that though he knew no french father hucheloup understood latin that he had evoked philosophy from his kitchen and that desirous simply of effacing lent he had equalled horace and the striking thing about it was that that also meant enter my wine shop nothing of all this is in existence now the mondetour labyrinth was disembowelled and widely opened in and probably no longer exists at the present moment the rue de la chanvrerie and corinthe have disappeared beneath the pavement of the rue rambuteau as we have already said corinthe was the meeting place if not the rallying point of courfeyrac and his friends it was grantaire who had discovered corinthe he had entered it on account of the carpe horas and had returned thither on account of the carpes au gras there they drank there they ate there they shouted they did not pay much they paid badly they did not pay at all but they were always welcome father hucheloup was a jovial
1605,host hucheloup that amiable man as was just said was a wine shop keeper with a mustache an amusing variety he always had an ill tempered air seemed to wish to intimidate his customers grumbled at the people who entered his establishment and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrel with them than of serving them with soup and yet we insist upon the word people were always welcome there this oddity had attracted customers to his shop and brought him young men who said to each other come hear father hucheloup growl he had been a fencing master all of a sudden he would burst out laughing a big voice a good fellow he had a comic foundation under a tragic exterior he asked nothing better than to frighten you very much like those snuff boxes which are in the shape of a pistol the detonation makes one sneeze mother hucheloup his wife was a bearded and a very homely creature about father hucheloup died with him disappeared the secret of stuffed carps his inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine shop but the cooking deteriorated and became execrable the wine which had always been bad became fearfully
1606,bad nevertheless courfeyrac and his friends continued to go to corinthe out of pity as bossuet said the widow hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rustic recollections she deprived them of their flatness by her pronunciation she had a way of her own of saying things which spiced her reminiscences of the village and of her springtime it had formerly been her delight so she affirmed to hear the loups de gorge rouges gorges chanter dans les ogrepines aubepines to hear the redbreasts sing in the hawthorn trees the hall on the first floor where the restaurant was situated was a large and long apartment encumbered with stools chairs benches and tables and with a crippled lame old billiard table it was reached by a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a square hole like the hatchway of a ship this room lighted by a single narrow window and by a lamp that was always burning had the air of a garret all the four footed furniture comported itself as though it had but three legs the whitewashed walls had for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of mame hucheloup elle
1607,etonne a dix pas elle epouvente a deux une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux on tremble a chaque instant qu'elle ne vous la mouche et qu'un beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche this was scrawled in charcoal on the wall mame hucheloup a good likeness went and came from morning till night before this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity two serving maids named matelote and gibelotte and who had never been known by any other names helped mame hucheloup to set on the tables the jugs of poor wine and the various broths which were served to the hungry patrons in earthenware bowls matelote large plump redhaired and noisy the favorite ex sultana of the defunct hucheloup was homelier than any mythological monster be it what it may still as it becomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress she was less homely than mame hucheloup gibelotte tall delicate white with a lymphatic pallor with circles round her eyes and drooping lids always languid and weary afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude the first up in the house and the last in bed waited on every one even the
1608,other maid silently and gently smiling through her fatigue with a vague and sleepy smile before entering the restaurant room the visitor read on the door the following line written there in chalk by courfeyrac regale si tu peux et mange si tu l'oses ii preliminary gayeties laigle de meaux as the reader knows lived more with joly than elsewhere he had a lodging as a bird has one on a branch the two friends lived together ate together slept together they had everything in common even musichetta to some extent they were what the subordinate monks who accompany monks are called bini on the morning of the th of june they went to corinthe to breakfast joly who was all stuffed up had a catarrh which laigle was beginning to share laigle's coat was threadbare but joly was well dressed it was about nine o'clock in the morning when they opened the door of corinthe they ascended to the first floor matelote and gibelotte received them oysters cheese and ham said laigle and they seated themselves at a table the wine shop was empty there was no one there but themselves gibelotte knowing joly and laigle set a bottle
1609,of wine on the table while they were busy with their first oysters a head appeared at the hatchway of the staircase and a voice said i am passing by i smell from the street a delicious odor of brie cheese i enter it was grantaire grantaire took a stool and drew up to the table at the sight of grantaire gibelotte placed two bottles of wine on the table that made three are you going to drink those two bottles laigle inquired of grantaire grantaire replied all are ingenious thou alone art ingenuous two bottles never yet astonished a man the others had begun by eating grantaire began by drinking half a bottle was rapidly gulped down so you have a hole in your stomach began laigle again you have one in your elbow said grantaire and after having emptied his glass he added ah by the way laigle of the funeral oration your coat is old i should hope so retorted laigle that's why we get on well together my coat and i it has acquired all my folds it does not bind me anywhere it is moulded on my deformities it falls in with all my movements
1610,i am only conscious of it because it keeps me warm old coats are just like old friends that's true ejaculated joly striking into the dialogue an old goat is an old abi ami friend especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up said grantaire grantaire demanded laigle have you just come from the boulevard no we have just seen the head of the procession pass joly and i it's a marvellous sight said joly how quiet this street is exclaimed laigle who would suspect that paris was turned upside down how plainly it is to be seen that in former days there were nothing but convents here in this neighborhood du breul and sauval give a list of them and so does the abbe lebeuf they were all round here they fairly swarmed booted and barefooted shaven bearded gray black white franciscans minims capuchins carmelites little augustines great augustines old augustines there was no end of them don't let's talk of monks interrupted grantaire it makes one want to scratch one's self then he exclaimed bouh i've just swallowed a bad oyster now hypochondria is taking possession of me again the oysters are spoiled the
1611,servants are ugly i hate the human race i just passed through the rue richelieu in front of the big public library that pile of oyster shells which is called a library is disgusting even to think of what paper what ink what scrawling and all that has been written what rascal was it who said that man was a featherless biped and then i met a pretty girl of my acquaintance who is as beautiful as the spring worthy to be called floreal and who is delighted enraptured as happy as the angels because a wretch yesterday a frightful banker all spotted with small pox deigned to take a fancy to her alas woman keeps on the watch for a protector as much as for a lover cats chase mice as well as birds two months ago that young woman was virtuous in an attic she adjusted little brass rings in the eyelet holes of corsets what do you call it she sewed she had a camp bed she dwelt beside a pot of flowers she was contented now here she is a bankeress this transformation took place last night i met the victim this morning in high spirits
1612,the hideous point about it is that the jade is as pretty to day as she was yesterday her financier did not show in her face roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women that the traces left upon them by caterpillars are visible ah there is no morality on earth i call to witness the myrtle the symbol of love the laurel the symbol of air the olive that ninny the symbol of peace the apple tree which came nearest rangling adam with its pips and the fig tree the grandfather of petticoats as for right do you know what right is the gauls covet clusium rome protects clusium and demands what wrong clusium has done to them brennus answers the wrong that alba did to you the wrong that fidenae did to you the wrong that the eques the volsci and the sabines have done to you they were your neighbors the clusians are ours we understand neighborliness just as you do you have stolen alba we shall take clusium rome said you shall not take clusium brennus took rome then he cried vae victis that is what right is ah what beasts of prey there are in
1613,this world what eagles it makes my flesh creep he held out his glass to joly who filled it then he drank and went on having hardly been interrupted by this glass of wine of which no one not even himself had taken any notice brennus who takes rome is an eagle the banker who takes the grisette is an eagle there is no more modesty in the one case than in the other so we believe in nothing there is but one reality drink whatever your opinion may be in favor of the lean cock like the canton of uri or in favor of the fat cock like the canton of glaris it matters little drink you talk to me of the boulevard of that procession et caetera et caetera come now is there going to be another revolution this poverty of means on the part of the good god astounds me he has to keep greasing the groove of events every moment there is a hitch it won't work quick a revolution the good god has his hands perpetually black with that cart grease if i were in his place i'd be perfectly simple about it i would
1614,not wind up my mechanism every minute i'd lead the human race in a straightforward way i'd weave matters mesh by mesh without breaking the thread i would have no provisional arrangements i would have no extraordinary repertory what the rest of you call progress advances by means of two motors men and events but sad to say from time to time the exceptional becomes necessary the ordinary troupe suffices neither for event nor for men among men geniuses are required among events revolutions great accidents are the law the order of things cannot do without them and judging from the apparition of comets one would be tempted to think that heaven itself finds actors needed for its performance at the moment when one expects it the least god placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament some queer star turns up underlined by an enormous tail and that causes the death of caesar brutus deals him a blow with a knife and god a blow with a comet crac and behold an aurora borealis behold a revolution behold a great man in big letters napoleon on guard the comet of at the head of the poster ah what
1615,a beautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes boum boum extraordinary show raise your eyes boobies everything is in disorder the star as well as the drama good god it is too much and not enough these resources gathered from exception seem magnificence and poverty my friends providence has come down to expedients what does a revolution prove that god is in a quandry he effects a coup d'etat because he god has not been able to make both ends meet in fact this confirms me in my conjectures as to jehovah's fortune and when i see so much distress in heaven and on earth from the bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without a hundred thousand livres of income when i see human destiny which is very badly worn and even royal destiny which is threadbare witness the prince de conde hung when i see winter which is nothing but a rent in the zenith through which the wind blows when i see so many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests of hills when i see the drops of dew those mock pearls when i see the
1616,frost that paste when i see humanity ripped apart and events patched up and so many spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon when i see so much misery everywhere i suspect that god is not rich the appearance exists it is true but i feel that he is hard up he gives a revolution as a tradesman whose money box is empty gives a ball god must not be judged from appearances beneath the gilding of heaven i perceive a poverty stricken universe creation is bankrupt that is why i am discontented here it is the th of june it is almost night ever since this morning i have been waiting for daylight to come it has not come and i bet that it won't come all day this is the inexactness of an ill paid clerk yes everything is badly arranged nothing fits anything else this old world is all warped i take my stand on the opposition everything goes awry the universe is a tease it's like children those who want them have none and those who don't want them have them total i'm vexed besides laigle de meaux that bald head offends
1617,my sight it humiliates me to think that i am of the same age as that baldy however i criticise but i do not insult the universe is what it is i speak here without evil intent and to ease my conscience receive eternal father the assurance of my distinguished consideration ah by all the saints of olympus and by all the gods of paradise i was not intended to be a parisian that is to say to rebound forever like a shuttlecock between two battledores from the group of the loungers to the group of the roysterers i was made to be a turk watching oriental houris all day long executing those exquisite egyptian dances as sensuous as the dream of a chaste man or a beauceron peasant or a venetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewomen or a petty german prince furnishing the half of a foot soldier to the germanic confederation and occupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge that is to say his frontier those are the positions for which i was born yes i have said a turk and i will not retract i do not understand how people can habitually take turks in
1618,bad part mohammed had his good points respect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques let us not insult mohammedanism the only religion which is ornamented with a hen roost now i insist on a drink the earth is a great piece of stupidity and it appears that they are going to fight all those imbeciles and to break each other's profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer in the month of june when they might go off with a creature on their arm to breathe the immense heaps of new mown hay in the meadows really people do commit altogether too many follies an old broken lantern which i have just seen at a bric a brac merchant's suggests a reflection to my mind it is time to enlighten the human race yes behold me sad again that's what comes of swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way i am growing melancholy once more oh frightful old world people strive turn each other out prostitute themselves kill each other and get used to it and grantaire after this fit of eloquence had a fit of coughing which was well
1619,earned a propos of revolution said joly it is decidedly abberent that barius is in lub does any one know with whom demanded laigle do no do i tell you marius love affairs exclaimed grantaire i can imagine it marius is a fog and he must have found a vapor marius is of the race of poets he who says poet says fool madman tymbraeus apollo marius and his marie or his marion or his maria or his mariette they must make a queer pair of lovers i know just what it is like ecstasies in which they forget to kiss pure on earth but joined in heaven they are souls possessed of senses they lie among the stars grantaire was attacking his second bottle and possibly his second harangue when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of the stairs it was a boy less than ten years of age ragged very small yellow with an odd phiz a vivacious eye an enormous amount of hair drenched with rain and wearing a contented air the child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three addressed himself to laigle de meaux are you monsieur bossuet that is my nickname replied
1620,laigle what do you want with me this a tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me do you know mother hucheloup i said yes rue chanvrerie the old man's widow he said to me go there there you will find m bossuet tell him from me a b c it's a joke that they're playing on you isn't it he gave me ten sous joly lend me ten sous said laigle and turning to grantaire grantaire lend me ten sous this made twenty sous which laigle handed to the lad thank you sir said the urchin what is your name inquired laigle navet gavroche's friend stay with us said laigle breakfast with us said grantaire the child replied i can't i belong in the procession i'm the one to shout down with polignac and executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him which is the most respectful of all possible salutes he took his departure the child gone grantaire took the word that is the pure bred gamin there are a great many varieties of the gamin species the notary's gamin is called skip the gutter the cook's gamin is called a scullion the baker's gamin is
1621,called a mitron the lackey's gamin is called a groom the marine gamin is called the cabin boy the soldier's gamin is called the drummer boy the painter's gamin is called paint grinder the tradesman's gamin is called an errand boy the courtesan gamin is called the minion the kingly gamin is called the dauphin the god gamin is called the bambino in the meantime laigle was engaged in reflection he said half aloud a b c that is to say the burial of lamarque the tall blonde remarked grantaire is enjolras who is sending you a warning shall we go ejaculated bossuet it's raiding said joly i have sworn to go through fire but not through water i don't wand to ged a gold i shall stay here said grantaire i prefer a breakfast to a hearse conclusion we remain said laigle well then let us drink besides we might miss the funeral without missing the riot ah the riot i am with you cried joly laigle rubbed his hands now we're going to touch up the revolution of as a matter of fact it does hurt the people along the seams i don't think much of your revolution
1622,said grantaire i don't execrate this government it is the crown tempered by the cotton night cap it is a sceptre ending in an umbrella in fact i think that to day with the present weather louis philippe might utilize his royalty in two directions he might extend the tip of the sceptre end against the people and open the umbrella end against heaven the room was dark large clouds had just finished the extinction of daylight there was no one in the wine shop or in the street every one having gone off to watch events is it mid day or midnight cried bossuet you can't see your hand before your face gibelotte fetch a light grantaire was drinking in a melancholy way enjolras disdains me he muttered enjolras said joly is ill grantaire is drunk it was to bossuet that he sent navet if he had come for me i would have followed him so much the worse for enjolras i won't go to his funeral this resolution once arrived at bossuet joly and grantaire did not stir from the wine shop by two o'clock in the afternoon the table at which they sat was covered with empty
1623,bottles two candles were burning on it one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green the other in the neck of a cracked carafe grantaire had seduced joly and bossuet to wine bossuet and joly had conducted grantaire back towards cheerfulness as for grantaire he had got beyond wine that merely moderate inspirer of dreams ever since mid day wine enjoys only a conventional popularity with serious drinkers there is in fact in the matter of inebriety white magic and black magic wine is only white magic grantaire was a daring drinker of dreams the blackness of a terrible fit of drunkenness yawning before him far from arresting him attracted him he had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass the beer glass is the abyss having neither opium nor hashish on hand and being desirous of filling his brain with twilight he had had recourse to that fearful mixture of brandy stout absinthe which produces the most terrible of lethargies it is of these three vapors beer brandy and absinthe that the lead of the soul is composed they are three grooms the celestial butterfly is drowned in them and there are formed there in a
1624,membranous smoke vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat three mute furies nightmare night and death which hover about the slumbering psyche grantaire had not yet reached that lamentable phase far from it he was tremendously gay and bossuet and joly retorted they clinked glasses grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of words and ideas a peculiarity of gesture he rested his left fist on his knee with dignity his arm forming a right angle and with cravat untied seated astride a stool his full glass in his right hand he hurled solemn words at the big maid servant matelote let the doors of the palace be thrown open let every one be a member of the french academy and have the right to embrace madame hucheloup let us drink and turning to madame hucheloup he added woman ancient and consecrated by use draw near that i may contemplate thee and joly exclaimed matelote and gibelotte dod't gib grantaire anything more to drink he has already devoured since this bording in wild prodigality two francs and ninety five centibes and grantaire began again who has been unhooking the stars without my permission and putting them on the table in
1625,the guise of candles bossuet though very drunk preserved his equanimity he was seated on the sill of the open window wetting his back in the falling rain and gazing at his two friends all at once he heard a tumult behind him hurried footsteps cries of to arms he turned round and saw in the rue saint denis at the end of the rue de la chanvrerie enjolras passing gun in hand and gavroche with his pistol feuilly with his sword courfeyrac with his sword and jean prouvaire with his blunderbuss combeferre with his gun bahorel with his gun and the whole armed and stormy rabble which was following them the rue de la chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long bossuet improvised a speaking trumpet from his two hands placed around his mouth and shouted courfeyrac courfeyrac hohee courfeyrac heard the shout caught sight of bossuet and advanced a few paces into the rue de la chanvrerie shouting what do you want which crossed a where are you going to make a barricade replied courfeyrac well here this is a good place make it here that's true aigle said courfeyrac and at a signal from courfeyrac the
1626,mob flung themselves into the rue de la chanvrerie iii night begins to descend upon grantaire the spot was in fact admirably adapted the entrance to the street widened out the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket without exit corinthe created an obstacle the rue mondetour was easily barricaded on the right and the left no attack was possible except from the rue saint denis that is to say in front and in full sight bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting hannibal terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob there was not a passer by who did not get out of sight in the space of a flash of lightning in the rear to right and left shops stables area doors windows blinds attic skylights shutters of every description were closed from the ground floor to the roof a terrified old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes poles for drying linen in order to deaden the effect of musketry the wine shop alone remained open and that for a very good reason that the mob had rushed into it ah my god ah my god
1627,sighed mame hucheloup bossuet had gone down to meet courfeyrac joly who had placed himself at the window exclaimed courfeyrac you ought to have brought an umbrella you will gatch gold in the meantime in the space of a few minutes twenty iron bars had been wrenched from the grated front of the wine shop ten fathoms of street had been unpaved gavroche and bahorel had seized in its passage and overturned the dray of a lime dealer named anceau this dray contained three barrels of lime which they placed beneath the piles of paving stones enjolras raised the cellar trap and all the widow hucheloup's empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime feuilly with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans had backed up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of rough stone blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured no one knows where the beams which served as props were torn from the neighboring house fronts and laid on the casks when bossuet and courfeyrac turned round half the street was already barred with a rampart higher than a man there is nothing like the
1628,hand of the populace for building everything that is built by demolishing matelote and gibelotte had mingled with the workers gibelotte went and came loaded with rubbish her lassitude helped on the barricade she served the barricade as she would have served wine with a sleepy air an omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street bossuet strode over the paving stones ran to it stopped the driver made the passengers alight offered his hand to the ladies dismissed the conductor and returned leading the vehicle and the horses by the bridle omnibuses said he do not pass the corinthe non licet omnibus adire corinthum an instant later the horses were unharnessed and went off at their will through the rue mondetour and the omnibus lying on its side completed the bar across the street mame hucheloup quite upset had taken refuge in the first story her eyes were vague and stared without seeing anything and she cried in a low tone her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her throat the end of the world has come she muttered joly deposited a kiss on mame hucheloup's fat red wrinkled neck and said to grantaire
1629,my dear fellow i have always regarded a woman's neck as an infinitely delicate thing but grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb matelote had mounted to the first floor once more grantaire seized her round her waist and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window matelote is homely he cried matelote is of a dream of ugliness matelote is a chimaera this is the secret of her birth a gothic pygmalion who was making gargoyles for cathedrals fell in love with one of them the most horrible one fine morning he besought love to give it life and this produced matelote look at her citizens she has chromate of lead colored hair like titian's mistress and she is a good girl i guarantee that she will fight well every good girl contains a hero as for mother hucheloup she's an old warrior look at her moustaches she inherited them from her husband a hussar indeed she will fight too these two alone will strike terror to the heart of the banlieue comrades we shall overthrow the government as true as there are fifteen intermediary acids between margaric acid and formic acid however that is a
1630,matter of perfect indifference to me gentlemen my father always detested me because i could not understand mathematics i understand only love and liberty i am grantaire the good fellow having never had any money i never acquired the habit of it and the result is that i have never lacked it but if i had been rich there would have been no more poor people you would have seen oh if the kind hearts only had fat purses how much better things would go i picture myself jesus christ with rothschild's fortune how much good he would do matelote embrace me you are voluptuous and timid you have cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister and lips which claim the kiss of a lover hold your tongue you cask said courfeyrac grantaire retorted i am the capitoul and the master of the floral games enjolras who was standing on the crest of the barricade gun in hand raised his beautiful austere face enjolras as the reader knows had something of the spartan and of the puritan in his composition he would have perished at thermopylae with leonidas and burned at drogheda with cromwell grantaire he shouted go get
1631,rid of the fumes of your wine somewhere else than here this is the place for enthusiasm not for drunkenness don't disgrace the barricade this angry speech produced a singular effect on grantaire one would have said that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face he seemed to be rendered suddenly sober he sat down put his elbows on a table near the window looked at enjolras with indescribable gentleness and said to him let me sleep here go and sleep somewhere else cried enjolras but grantaire still keeping his tender and troubled eyes fixed on him replied let me sleep here until i die enjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes grantaire you are incapable of believing of thinking of willing of living and of dying grantaire replied in a grave tone you will see he stammered a few more unintelligible words then his head fell heavily on the table and as is the usual effect of the second period of inebriety into which enjolras had roughly and abruptly thrust him an instant later he had fallen asleep iv an attempt to console the widow hucheloup bahorel in ecstasies over the barricade shouted here's the
1632,street in its low necked dress how well it looks courfeyrac as he demolished the wine shop to some extent sought to console the widowed proprietress mother hucheloup weren't you complaining the other day because you had had a notice served on you for infringing the law because gibelotte shook a counterpane out of your window yes my good monsieur courfeyrac ah good heavens are you going to put that table of mine in your horror too and it was for the counterpane and also for a pot of flowers which fell from the attic window into the street that the government collected a fine of a hundred francs if that isn't an abomination what is well mother hucheloup we are avenging you mother hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit which she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account she was satisfied after the manner of that arab woman who having received a box on the ear from her husband went to complain to her father and cried for vengeance saying father you owe my husband affront for affront the father asked on which cheek did you receive the blow on the left
1633,cheek the father slapped her right cheek and said now you are satisfied go tell your husband that he boxed my daughter's ears and that i have accordingly boxed his wife's the rain had ceased recruits had arrived workmen had brought under their blouses a barrel of powder a basket containing bottles of vitriol two or three carnival torches and a basket filled with fire pots left over from the king's festival this festival was very recent having taken place on the st of may it was said that these munitions came from a grocer in the faubourg saint antoine named pepin they smashed the only street lantern in the rue de la chanvrerie the lantern corresponding to one in the rue saint denis and all the lanterns in the surrounding streets de mondetour du cygne des precheurs and de la grande and de la petite truanderie enjolras combeferre and courfeyrac directed everything two barricades were now in process of construction at once both of them resting on the corinthe house and forming a right angle the larger shut off the rue de la chanvrerie the other closed the rue mondetour on the side of the rue de cygne this
1634,last barricade which was very narrow was constructed only of casks and paving stones there were about fifty workers on it thirty were armed with guns for on their way they had effected a wholesale loan from an armorer's shop nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than this troop one had a round jacket a cavalry sabre and two holster pistols another was in his shirt sleeves with a round hat and a powder horn slung at his side a third wore a plastron of nine sheets of gray paper and was armed with a saddler's awl there was one who was shouting let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our bayonet this man had no bayonet another spread out over his coat the cross belt and cartridge box of a national guardsman the cover of the cartridge box being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted public order there were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the legions few hats no cravats many bare arms some pikes add to this all ages all sorts of faces small pale young men and bronzed longshoremen all
1635,were in haste and as they helped each other they discussed the possible chances that they would receive succor about three o'clock in the morning that they were sure of one regiment that paris would rise terrible sayings with which was mingled a sort of cordial joviality one would have pronounced them brothers but they did not know each other's names great perils have this fine characteristic that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers a fire had been lighted in the kitchen and there they were engaged in moulding into bullets pewter mugs spoons forks and all the brass table ware of the establishment in the midst of it all they drank caps and buckshot were mixed pell mell on the tables with glasses of wine in the billiard hall mame hucheloup matelote and gibelotte variously modified by terror which had stupefied one rendered another breathless and roused the third were tearing up old dish cloths and making lint three insurgents were assisting them three bushy haired jolly blades with beards and moustaches who plucked away at the linen with the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble the man of lofty stature whom courfeyrac combeferre and
1636,enjolras had observed at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of the rue des billettes was at work on the smaller barricade and was making himself useful there gavroche was working on the larger one as for the young man who had been waiting for courfeyrac at his lodgings and who had inquired for m marius he had disappeared at about the time when the omnibus had been overturned gavroche completely carried away and radiant had undertaken to get everything in readiness he went came mounted descended re mounted whistled and sparkled he seemed to be there for the encouragement of all had he any incentive yes certainly his poverty had he wings yes certainly his joy gavroche was a whirlwind he was constantly visible he was incessantly audible he filled the air as he was everywhere at once he was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity no halt was possible with him the enormous barricade felt him on its haunches he troubled the loungers he excited the idle he reanimated the weary he grew impatient over the thoughtful he inspired gayety in some and breath in others wrath in others movement in all now pricking
1637,a student now biting an artisan he alighted paused flew off again hovered over the tumult and the effort sprang from one party to another murmuring and humming and harassed the whole company a fly on the immense revolutionary coach perpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in his little lungs courage more paving stones more casks more machines where are you now a hod of plaster for me to stop this hole with your barricade is very small it must be carried up put everything on it fling everything there stick it all in break down the house a barricade is mother gibou's tea hullo here's a glass door this elicited an exclamation from the workers a glass door what do you expect us to do with a glass door tubercle hercules yourselves retorted gavroche a glass door is an excellent thing in a barricade it does not prevent an attack but it prevents the enemy taking it so you've never prigged apples over a wall where there were broken bottles a glass door cuts the corns of the national guard when they try to mount on the barricade pardi glass is a treacherous thing well
1638,you haven't a very wildly lively imagination comrades however he was furious over his triggerless pistol he went from one to another demanding a gun i want a gun why don't you give me a gun give you a gun said combeferre come now said gavroche why not i had one in when we had a dispute with charles x enjolras shrugged his shoulders when there are enough for the men we will give some to the children gavroche wheeled round haughtily and answered if you are killed before me i shall take yours gamin said enjolras greenhorn said gavroche a dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the street created a diversion gavroche shouted to him come with us young fellow well now don't we do anything for this old country of ours the dandy fled v preparations the journals of the day which said that that nearly impregnable structure of the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie as they call it reached to the level of the first floor were mistaken the fact is that it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet it was built in
1639,such a manner that the combatants could at their will either disappear behind it or dominate the barrier and even scale its crest by means of a quadruple row of paving stones placed on top of each other and arranged as steps in the interior on the outside the front of the barricade composed of piles of paving stones and casks bound together by beams and planks which were entangled in the wheels of anceau's dray and of the overturned omnibus had a bristling and inextricable aspect an aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been made between the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade which was furthest from the wine shop so that an exit was possible at this point the pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with ropes and a red flag fastened to this pole floated over the barricade the little mondetour barricade hidden behind the wine shop building was not visible the two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt enjolras and courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the other fragment of the rue mondetour which opens through the rue des precheurs an issue
1640,into the halles wishing no doubt to preserve a possible communication with the outside and not entertaining much fear of an attack through the dangerous and difficult street of the rue des precheurs with the exception of this issue which was left free and which constituted what folard in his strategical style would have termed a branch and taking into account also the narrow cutting arranged on the rue de la chanvrerie the interior of the barricade where the wine shop formed a salient angle presented an irregular square closed on all sides there existed an interval of twenty paces between the grand barrier and the lofty houses which formed the background of the street so that one might say that the barricade rested on these houses all inhabited but closed from top to bottom all this work was performed without any hindrance in less than an hour and without this handful of bold men seeing a single bear skin cap or a single bayonet make their appearance the very bourgeois who still ventured at this hour of riot to enter the rue saint denis cast a glance at the rue de la chanvrerie caught sight of the barricade and
1641,redoubled their pace the two barricades being finished and the flag run up a table was dragged out of the wine shop and courfeyrac mounted on the table enjolras brought the square coffer and courfeyrac opened it this coffer was filled with cartridges when the mob saw the cartridges a tremor ran through the bravest and a momentary silence ensued courfeyrac distributed them with a smile each one received thirty cartridges many had powder and set about making others with the bullets which they had run as for the barrel of powder it stood on a table on one side near the door and was held in reserve the alarm beat which ran through all paris did not cease but it had finally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which they no longer paid any attention this noise retreated at times and again drew near with melancholy undulations they loaded the guns and carbines all together without haste with solemn gravity enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside the barricades one in the rue de la chanvrerie the second in the rue des precheurs the third at the corner of the rue de la petite truanderie
1642,then the barricades having been built the posts assigned the guns loaded the sentinels stationed they waited alone in those redoubtable streets through which no one passed any longer surrounded by those dumb houses which seemed dead and in which no human movement palpitated enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was drawing on in the midst of that silence through which something could be felt advancing and which had about it something tragic and terrifying isolated armed determined and tranquil vi waiting during those hours of waiting what did they do we must needs tell since this is a matter of history while the men made bullets and the women lint while a large saucepan of melted brass and lead destined to the bullet mould smoked over a glowing brazier while the sentinels watched weapon in hand on the barricade while enjolras whom it was impossible to divert kept an eye on the sentinels combeferre courfeyrac jean prouvaire feuilly bossuet joly bahorel and some others sought each other out and united as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in their student life and in one corner of this wine shop which had been converted into a
1643,casement a couple of paces distant from the redoubt which they had built with their carbines loaded and primed resting against the backs of their chairs these fine young fellows so close to a supreme hour began to recite love verses what verses these vous rappelez vous notre douce vie lorsque nous etions si jeunes tous deux et que nous n'avions au coeur d'autre envie que d'etre bien mis et d'etre amoureux lorsqu'en ajoutant votre age a mon age nous ne comptions pas a deux quarante ans et que dans notre humble et petit menage tout meme l'hiver nous etait printemps beaux jours manuel etait fier et sage paris s'asseyait a de saints banquets foy lancait la foudre et votre corsage avait une epingle ou je me piquais tout vous contemplait avocat sans causes quand je vous menais au prado diner vous etiez jolie au point que les roses me faisaient l'effet de se retourner je les entendais dire est elle belle comme elle sent bon quels cheveux a flots sous son mantelet elle cache une aile son bonnet charmant est a peine eclos j'errais avec toi pressant ton bras souple les passants crovaient que l'amour charme avait marie dans
1644,notre heureux couple le doux mois d'avril au beau mois de mai nous vivions caches contents porte close devorant l'amour bon fruit defendu ma bouche n'avait pas dit une chose que deja ton coeur avait repondu la sorbonne etait l'endroit bucolique ou je t'adorais du soir au matin c'est ainsi qu'une ame amoureuse applique la carte du tendre au pays latin o place maubert o place dauphine quand dans le taudis frais et printanier tu tirais ton bas sur ton jambe fine je voyais un astre au fond du grenier j'ai fort lu platon mais rien ne m'en reste mieux que malebranche et que lamennais tu me demontrais la bonte celeste avec une fleur que tu me donnais je t'obeissais tu m etais soumise o grenier dore te lacer te voir aller et venir des l'aube en chemise mirant ton jeune front a ton vieux miroir et qui done pourrait perde la memoire de ces temps d'aurore et de firmament de rubans de fleurs de gaze et de moire ou l'amour begaye un argot charmant nos jardins etaient un pot de tulipe tu masquais la vitre avec un jupon je prenais le bol de terre de pipe et je te

1646,the large one one of those wax torches such as are to be met with on shrove tuesday in front of vehicles loaded with masks on their way to la courtille these torches as the reader has seen came from the faubourg saint antoine the torch had been placed in a sort of cage of paving stones closed on three sides to shelter it from the wind and disposed in such a fashion that all the light fell on the flag the street and the barricade remained sunk in gloom and nothing was to be seen except the red flag formidably illuminated as by an enormous dark lantern this light enhanced the scarlet of the flag with an indescribable and terrible purple vii the man recruited in the rue des billettes night was fully come nothing made its appearance all that they heard was confused noises and at intervals fusillades but these were rare badly sustained and distant this respite which was thus prolonged was a sign that the government was taking its time and collecting its forces these fifty men were waiting for sixty thousand enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls on the threshold
1647,of redoubtable events he went in search of gavroche who had set to making cartridges in the tap room by the dubious light of two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution on account of the powder which was scattered on the tables these two candles cast no gleam outside the insurgents had moreover taken pains not to have any light in the upper stories gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment but not precisely with his cartridges the man of the rue des billettes had just entered the tap room and had seated himself at the table which was the least lighted a musket of large model had fallen to his share and he held it between his legs gavroche who had been up to that moment distracted by a hundred amusing things had not even seen this man when he entered gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes admiring his gun then all at once when the man was seated the street urchin sprang to his feet any one who had spied upon that man up to that moment would have seen that he was observing everything in the barricade and in the band of insurgents
1648,with singular attention but from the moment when he had entered this room he had fallen into a sort of brown study and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on the gamin approached this pensive personage and began to step around him on tiptoe as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is afraid of waking at the same time over his childish countenance which was at once so impudent and so serious so giddy and so profound so gay and so heart breaking passed all those grimaces of an old man which signify ah bah impossible my sight is bad i am dreaming can this be no it is not but yes why no etc gavroche balanced on his heels clenched both fists in his pockets moved his neck around like a bird expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip he was astounded uncertain incredulous convinced dazzled he had the mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart discovering a venus among the blowsy females and the air of an amateur recognizing a raphael in a heap of daubs his whole being was at work
1649,the instinct which scents out and the intelligence which combines it was evident that a great event had happened in gavroche's life it was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that enjolras accosted him you are small said enjolras you will not be seen go out of the barricade slip along close to the houses skirmish about a bit in the streets and come back and tell me what is going on gavroche raised himself on his haunches so the little chaps are good for something that's very lucky i'll go in the meanwhile trust to the little fellows and distrust the big ones and gavroche raising his head and lowering his voice added as he indicated the man of the rue des billettes do you see that big fellow there well he's a police spy are you sure of it it isn't two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the port royal where i was taking the air by my ear enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very low tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand the man left the room and
1650,returned almost immediately accompanied by three others the four men four porters with broad shoulders went and placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention behind the table on which the man of the rue des billettes was leaning with his elbows they were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him then enjolras approached the man and demanded of him who are you at this abrupt query the man started he plunged his gaze deep into enjolras clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latter's meaning he smiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful more energetic and more resolute could be seen in the world and replied with haughty gravity i see what it is well yes you are a police spy i am an agent of the authorities and your name javert enjolras made a sign to the four men in the twinkling of an eye before javert had time to turn round he was collared thrown down pinioned and searched they found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of glass and bearing on one side the arms of france engraved and with this motto supervision and vigilance and on the other
1651,this note javert inspector of police aged fifty two and the signature of the prefect of police of that day m gisquet besides this he had his watch and his purse which contained several gold pieces they left him his purse and his watch under the watch at the bottom of his fob they felt and seized a paper in an envelope which enjolras unfolded and on which he read these five lines written in the very hand of the prefect of police as soon as his political mission is accomplished inspector javert will make sure by special supervision whether it is true that the malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the seine near the jena bridge the search ended they lifted javert to his feet bound his arms behind his back and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the room which had formerly given the wine shop its name gavroche who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved of everything with a silent toss of his head stepped up to javert and said to him it's the mouse who has caught the cat all this was so
1652,rapidly executed that it was all over when those about the wine shop noticed it javert had not uttered a single cry at the sight of javert bound to the post courfeyrac bossuet joly combeferre and the men scattered over the two barricades came running up javert with his back to the post and so surrounded with ropes that he could not make a movement raised his head with the intrepid serenity of the man who has never lied he is a police spy said enjolras and turning to javert you will be shot ten minutes before the barricade is taken javert replied in his most imperious tone why not at once we are saving our powder then finish the business with a blow from a knife spy said the handsome enjolras we are judges and not assassins then he called gavroche here you go about your business do what i told you i'm going cried gavroche and halting as he was on the point of setting out by the way you will give me his gun and he added i leave you the musician but i want the clarionet the gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through
1653,the opening in the large barricade viii many interrogation points with regard to a certain le cabuc whose name may not have been le cabuc the tragic picture which we have undertaken would not be complete the reader would not see those grand moments of social birth pangs in a revolutionary birth which contain convulsion mingled with effort in their exact and real relief were we to omit in the sketch here outlined an incident full of epic and savage horror which occurred almost immediately after gavroche's departure mobs as the reader knows are like a snowball and collect as they roll along a throng of tumultuous men these men do not ask each other whence they come among the passers by who had joined the rabble led by enjolras combeferre and courfeyrac there had been a person wearing the jacket of a street porter which was very threadbare on the shoulders who gesticulated and vociferated and who had the look of a drunken savage this man whose name or nickname was le cabuc and who was moreover an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him was very drunk or assumed the appearance of being so and had
1654,seated himself with several others at a table which they had dragged outside of the wine shop this cabuc while making those who vied with him drunk seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at the extremity of the barricade whose five stories commanded the whole street and faced the rue saint denis all at once he exclaimed do you know comrades it is from that house yonder that we must fire when we are at the windows the deuce is in it if any one can advance into the street yes but the house is closed said one of the drinkers let us knock they will not open let us break in the door le cabuc runs to the door which had a very massive knocker and knocks the door opens not he strikes a second blow no one answers a third stroke the same silence is there any one here shouts cabuc nothing stirs then he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end it was an ancient alley door low vaulted narrow solid entirely of oak lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays
1655,a genuine prison postern the blows from the butt end of the gun made the house tremble but did not shake the door nevertheless it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed for a tiny square window was finally seen to open on the third story and at this aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray haired old man who was the porter and who held a candle the man who was knocking paused gentlemen said the porter what do you want open said cabuc that cannot be gentlemen open nevertheless impossible gentlemen le cabuc took his gun and aimed at the porter but as he was below and as it was very dark the porter did not see him will you open yes or no no gentlemen do you say no i say no my goo the porter did not finish the shot was fired the ball entered under his chin and came out at the nape of his neck after traversing the jugular vein the old man fell back without a sigh the candle fell and was extinguished and nothing more was to be seen except a motionless head lying on the sill of the
1656,small window and a little whitish smoke which floated off towards the roof there said le cabuc dropping the butt end of his gun to the pavement he had hardly uttered this word when he felt a hand laid on his shoulder with the weight of an eagle's talon and he heard a voice saying to him on your knees the murderer turned round and saw before him enjolras cold white face enjolras held a pistol in his hand he had hastened up at the sound of the discharge he had seized cabuc's collar blouse shirt and suspender with his left hand on your knees he repeated and with an imperious motion the frail young man of twenty years bent the thickset and sturdy porter like a reed and brought him to his knees in the mire le cabuc attempted to resist but he seemed to have been seized by a superhuman hand enjolras pale with bare neck and dishevelled hair and his woman's face had about him at that moment something of the antique themis his dilated nostrils his downcast eyes gave to his implacable greek profile that expression of wrath and that expression of chastity which as the
1657,ancient world viewed the matter befit justice the whole barricade hastened up then all ranged themselves in a circle at a distance feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the presence of the thing which they were about to behold le cabuc vanquished no longer tried to struggle and trembled in every limb enjolras released him and drew out his watch collect yourself said he think or pray you have one minute mercy murmured the murderer then he dropped his head and stammered a few inarticulate oaths enjolras never took his eyes off of him he allowed a minute to pass then he replaced his watch in his fob that done he grasped le cabuc by the hair as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and shrieked and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear many of those intrepid men who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of adventures turned aside their heads an explosion was heard the assassin fell to the pavement face downwards enjolras straightened himself up and cast a convinced and severe glance around him then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said throw
1658,that outside three men raised the body of the unhappy wretch which was still agitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled and flung it over the little barricade into the rue mondetour enjolras was thoughtful it is impossible to say what grandiose shadows slowly spread over his redoubtable serenity all at once he raised his voice a silence fell upon them citizens said enjolras what that man did is frightful what i have done is horrible he killed therefore i killed him i had to do it because insurrection must have its discipline assassination is even more of a crime here than elsewhere we are under the eyes of the revolution we are the priests of the republic we are the victims of duty and must not be possible to slander our combat i have therefore tried that man and condemned him to death as for myself constrained as i am to do what i have done and yet abhorring it i have judged myself also and you shall soon see to what i have condemned myself those who listened to him shuddered we will share thy fate cried combeferre so be it replied enjolras
1659,one word more in executing this man i have obeyed necessity but necessity is a monster of the old world necessity's name is fatality now the law of progress is that monsters shall disappear before the angels and that fatality shall vanish before fraternity it is a bad moment to pronounce the word love no matter i do pronounce it and i glorify it love the future is thine death i make use of thee but i hate thee citizens in the future there will be neither darkness nor thunderbolts neither ferocious ignorance nor bloody retaliation as there will be no more satan there will be no more michael in the future no one will kill any one else the earth will beam with radiance the human race will love the day will come citizens when all will be concord harmony light joy and life it will come and it is in order that it may come that we are about to die enjolras ceased his virgin lips closed and he remained for some time standing on the spot where he had shed blood in marble immobility his staring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones jean
1660,prouvaire and combeferre pressed each other's hands silently and leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade they watched with an admiration in which there was some compassion that grave young man executioner and priest composed of light like crystal and also of rock let us say at once that later on after the action when the bodies were taken to the morgue and searched a police agent's card was found on le cabuc the author of this book had in his hands in the special report on this subject made to the prefect of police in we will add that if we are to believe a tradition of the police which is strange but probably well founded le cabuc was claquesous the fact is that dating from the death of le cabuc there was no longer any question of claquesous claquesous had nowhere left any trace of his disappearance he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the invisible his life had been all shadows his end was night the whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion of that tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quickly terminated when courfeyrac
1661,again beheld on the barricade the small young man who had inquired of him that morning for marius this lad who had a bold and reckless air had come by night to join the insurgents thirteenth marius enters the shadow i from the rue plumet to the quartier saint denis the voice which had summoned marius through the twilight to the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie had produced on him the effect of the voice of destiny he wished to die the opportunity presented itself he knocked at the door of the tomb a hand in the darkness offered him the key these melancholy openings which take place in the gloom before despair are tempting marius thrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him to pass emerged from the garden and said i will go mad with grief no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in his brain incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those two months passed in the intoxication of youth and love overwhelmed at once by all the reveries of despair he had but one desire remaining to make a speedy end of all he set out at rapid pace
1662,he found himself most opportunely armed as he had javert's pistols with him the young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse had vanished from his sight in the street marius who had emerged from the rue plumet by the boulevard traversed the esplanade and the bridge of the invalides the champs elysees the place louis xv and reached the rue de rivoli the shops were open there the gas was burning under the arcades women were making their purchases in the stalls people were eating ices in the cafe laiter and nibbling small cakes at the english pastry cook's shop only a few posting chaises were setting out at a gallop from the hotel des princes and the hotel meurice marius entered the rue saint honore through the passage delorme there the shops were closed the merchants were chatting in front of their half open doors people were walking about the street lanterns were lighted beginning with the first floor all the windows were lighted as usual there was cavalry on the place du palais royal marius followed the rue saint honore in proportion as he left the palais royal behind him there were fewer
1663,lighted windows the shops were fast shut no one was chatting on the thresholds the street grew sombre and at the same time the crowd increased in density for the passers by now amounted to a crowd no one could be seen to speak in this throng and yet there arose from it a dull deep murmur near the fountain of the arbre sec there were assemblages motionless and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the midst of running water at the entrance to the rue des prouvaires the crowd no longer walked it formed a resisting massive solid compact almost impenetrable block of people who were huddled together and conversing in low tones there were hardly any black coats or round hats now but smock frocks blouses caps and bristling and cadaverous heads this multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom its whisperings had the hoarse accent of a vibration although not one of them was walking a dull trampling was audible in the mire beyond this dense portion of the throng in the rue du roule in the rue des prouvaires and in the extension of the rue saint honore there
1664,was no longer a single window in which a candle was burning only the solitary and diminishing rows of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance the lanterns of that date resembled large red stars hanging to ropes and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider these streets were not deserted there could be descried piles of guns moving bayonets and troops bivouacking no curious observer passed that limit there circulation ceased there the rabble ended and the army began marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more he had been summoned he must go he found a means to traverse the throng and to pass the bivouac of the troops he shunned the patrols he avoided the sentinels he made a circuit reached the rue de bethisy and directed his course towards the halles at the corner of the rue des bourdonnais there were no longer any lanterns after having passed the zone of the crowd he had passed the limits of the troops he found himself in something startling there was no longer a passer by no longer a soldier no longer a
1665,light there was no one solitude silence night i know not what chill which seized hold upon one entering a street was like entering a cellar he continued to advance he took a few steps some one passed close to him at a run was it a man or a woman were there many of them he could not have told it had passed and vanished proceeding from circuit to circuit he reached a lane which he judged to be the rue de la poterie near the middle of this street he came in contact with an obstacle he extended his hands it was an overturned wagon his foot recognized pools of water gullies and paving stones scattered and piled up a barricade had been begun there and abandoned he climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the barrier he walked very near the street posts and guided himself along the walls of the houses a little beyond the barricade it seemed to him that he could make out something white in front of him he approached it took on a form it was two white horses the horses of the omnibus harnessed by bossuet
1666,in the morning who had been straying at random all day from street to street and had finally halted there with the weary patience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men than man understands the actions of providence marius left the horses behind him as he was approaching a street which seemed to him to be the rue du contrat social a shot coming no one knows whence and traversing the darkness at random whistled close by him and the bullet pierced a brass shaving dish suspended above his head over a hairdresser's shop this pierced shaving dish was still to be seen in in the rue du contrat social at the corner of the pillars of the market this shot still betokened life from that instant forth he encountered nothing more the whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps nevertheless marius pressed forward ii an owl's view of paris a being who could have hovered over paris that night with the wing of the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle all that old quarter of the halles which is like a city within a city through
1667,which run the rues saint denis and saint martin where a thousand lanes cross and of which the insurgents had made their redoubt and their stronghold would have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of paris there the glance fell into an abyss thanks to the broken lanterns thanks to the closed windows there all radiance all life all sound all movement ceased the invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere and maintained order that is to say night the necessary tactics of insurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity to multiply every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains at dusk every window where a candle was burning received a shot the light was extinguished sometimes the inhabitant was killed hence nothing was stirring there was nothing but fright mourning stupor in the houses and in the streets a sort of sacred horror not even the long rows of windows and stores the indentations of the chimneys and the roofs and the vague reflections which are cast back by the wet and muddy pavements were visible an eye cast upward at that mass of
1668,shadows might perhaps have caught a glimpse here and there at intervals of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines and profiles of singular buildings something like the lights which go and come in ruins it was at such points that the barricades were situated the rest was a lake of obscurity foggy heavy and funereal above which in motionless and melancholy outlines rose the tower of saint jacques the church of saint merry and two or three more of those grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms all around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth in the quarters where the parisian circulation had not been annihilated and where a few street lanterns still burned the aerial observer might have distinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets the dull rumble of artillery and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were swelling from minute to minute a formidable girdle which was slowly drawing in and around the insurrection the invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous cavern everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless and as we have just seen any street which one might come to offered nothing
1669,but darkness a wild darkness full of traps full of unseen and formidable shocks into which it was alarming to penetrate and in which it was terrible to remain where those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street snares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night all was over no more light was to be hoped for henceforth except the lightning of guns no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death where how when no one knew but it was certain and inevitable in this place which had been marked out for the struggle the government and the insurrection the national guard and popular societies the bourgeois and the uprising groping their way were about to come into contact the necessity was the same for both the only possible issue thenceforth was to emerge thence killed or conquerors a situation so extreme an obscurity so powerful that the most timid felt themselves seized with resolution and the most daring with terror moreover on both sides the fury the rage and the determination were equal
1670,for the one party to advance meant death and no one dreamed of retreating for the other to remain meant death and no one dreamed of flight it was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day that triumph should rest either here or there that the insurrection should prove itself a revolution or a skirmish the government understood this as well as the parties the most insignificant bourgeois felt it hence a thought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable gloom of this quarter where all was at the point of being decided hence a redoubled anxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point of emerging here only one sound was audible a sound as heart rending as the death rattle as menacing as a malediction the tocsin of saint merry nothing could be more blood curdling than the clamor of that wild and desperate bell wailing amid the shadows as it often happens nature seemed to have fallen into accord with what men were about to do nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect the stars had disappeared heavy clouds filled the horizon with their melancholy folds a black sky rested on
1671,these dead streets as though an immense winding sheet were being outspread over this immense tomb while a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in the same locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary events while youth the secret associations the schools in the name of principles and the middle classes in the name of interests were approaching preparatory to dashing themselves together clasping and throwing each other while each one hastened and invited the last and decisive hour of the crisis far away and quite outside of this fatal quarter in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of that wretched old paris which disappears under the splendor of happy and opulent paris the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving utterance to a dull roar a fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute and of the word of god which terrifies the weak and which warns the wise which comes both from below like the voice of the lion and from on high like the voice of the thunder iii the extreme edge marius had reached the halles there everything was still calmer more obscure
1672,and more motionless than in the neighboring streets one would have said that the glacial peace of the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the heavens nevertheless a red glow brought out against this black background the lofty roofs of the houses which barred the rue de la chanvrerie on the saint eustache side it was the reflection of the torch which was burning in the corinthe barricade marius directed his steps towards that red light it had drawn him to the marche aux poirees and he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the rue des precheurs he entered it the insurgents sentinel who was guarding the other end did not see him he felt that he was very close to that which he had come in search of and he walked on tiptoe in this manner he reached the elbow of that short section of the rue mondetour which was as the reader will remember the only communication which enjolras had preserved with the outside world at the corner of the last house on his left he thrust his head forward and looked into the fragment of the rue mondetour a little
1673,beyond the angle of the lane and the rue de la chanvrerie which cast a broad curtain of shadow in which he was himself engulfed he perceived some light on the pavement a bit of the wine shop and beyond a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall and men crouching down with guns on their knees all this was ten fathoms distant from him it was the interior of the barricade the houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of the wine shop the large barricade and the flag from him marius had but a step more to take then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post folded his arms and fell to thinking about his father he thought of that heroic colonel pontmercy who had been so proud a soldier who had guarded the frontier of france under the republic and had touched the frontier of asia under napoleon who had beheld genoa alexandria milan turin madrid vienna dresden berlin moscow who had left on all the victorious battle fields of europe drops of that same blood which he marius had in his veins who had grown gray before his time
1674,in discipline and command who had lived with his sword belt buckled his epaulets falling on his breast his cockade blackened with powder his brow furrowed with his helmet in barracks in camp in the bivouac in ambulances and who at the expiration of twenty years had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek a smiling countenance tranquil admirable pure as a child having done everything for france and nothing against her he said to himself that his day had also come now that his hour had struck that following his father he too was about to show himself brave intrepid bold to run to meet the bullets to offer his breast to bayonets to shed his blood to seek the enemy to seek death that he was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battle and that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was the street and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil war he beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him and into this he was about to fall then he shuddered he thought of his father's
1675,sword which his grandfather had sold to a second hand dealer and which he had so mournfully regretted he said to himself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape from him and to depart in wrath into the gloom that if it had thus fled it was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion the war of the gutters the war of the pavements fusillades through cellar windows blows given and received in the rear it was because coming from marengo and friedland it did not wish to go to the rue de la chanvrerie it was because after what it had done with the father it did not wish to do this for the son he told himself that if that sword were there if after taking possession of it at his father's pillow he had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darkness between frenchmen in the streets it would assuredly have scorched his hands and burst out aflame before his eyes like the sword of the angel he told himself that it was fortunate that
1676,it was not there and that it had disappeared that that was well that that was just that his grandfather had been the true guardian of his father's glory and that it was far better that the colonel's sword should be sold at auction sold to the old clothes man thrown among the old junk than that it should to day wound the side of his country and then he fell to weeping bitterly this was horrible but what was he to do live without cosette he could not since she was gone he must needs die had he not given her his word of honor that he would die she had gone knowing that this meant that it pleased her that marius should die and then it was clear that she no longer loved him since she had departed thus without warning without a word without a letter although she knew his address what was the good of living and why should he live now and then what should he retreat after going so far should he flee from danger after having approached it should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade slip away all
1677,in a tremble saying after all i have had enough of it as it is i have seen it that suffices this is civil war and i shall take my leave should he abandon his friends who were expecting him who were in need of him possibly who were a mere handful against an army should he be untrue at once to his love to country to his word should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism but this was impossible and if the phantom of his father was there in the gloom and beheld him retreating he would beat him on the loins with the flat of his sword and shout to him march on you poltroon thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts he dropped his head all at once he raised it a sort of splendid rectification had just been effected in his mind there is a widening of the sphere of thought which is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave it makes one see clearly to be near death the vision of the action into which he felt that he was perhaps on the point of entering appeared to him
1678,no more as lamentable but as superb the war of the street was suddenly transfigured by some unfathomable inward working of his soul before the eye of his thought all the tumultuous interrogation points of revery recurred to him in throngs but without troubling him he left none of them unanswered let us see why should his father be indignant are there not cases where insurrection rises to the dignity of duty what was there that was degrading for the son of colonel pontmercy in the combat which was about to begin it is no longer montmirail nor champaubert it is something quite different the question is no longer one of sacred territory but of a holy idea the country wails that may be but humanity applauds but is it true that the country does wail france bleeds but liberty smiles and in the presence of liberty's smile france forgets her wound and then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view why do we speak of civil war civil war what does that mean is there a foreign war is not all war between men war between brothers war is qualified only by its
1679,object there is no such thing as foreign or civil war there is only just and unjust war until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded war that at least which is the effort of the future which is hastening on against the past which is lagging in the rear may be necessary what have we to reproach that war with war does not become a disgrace the sword does not become a disgrace except when it is used for assassinating the right progress reason civilization truth then war whether foreign or civil is iniquitous it is called crime outside the pale of that holy thing justice by what right does one form of man despise another by what right should the sword of washington disown the pike of camille desmoulins leonidas against the stranger timoleon against the tyrant which is the greater the one is the defender the other the liberator shall we brand every appeal to arms within a city's limits without taking the object into a consideration then note the infamy of brutus marcel arnould von blankenheim coligny hedgerow war war of the streets why not that was the war of ambiorix of artevelde of
1680,marnix of pelagius but ambiorix fought against rome artevelde against france marnix against spain pelagius against the moors all against the foreigner well the monarchy is a foreigner oppression is a stranger the right divine is a stranger despotism violates the moral frontier an invasion violates the geographical frontier driving out the tyrant or driving out the english in both cases regaining possession of one's own territory there comes an hour when protestation no longer suffices after philosophy action is required live force finishes what the idea has sketched out prometheus chained begins arostogeiton ends the encyclopedia enlightens souls the th of august electrifies them after aeschylus thrasybulus after diderot danton multitudes have a tendency to accept the master their mass bears witness to apathy a crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience men must be stirred up pushed on treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance their eyes must be wounded by the true light must be hurled at them in terrible handfuls they must be a little thunderstruck themselves at their own well being this dazzling awakens them hence the necessity of tocsins and wars great combatants must rise must enlighten nations with audacity
1681,and shake up that sad humanity which is covered with gloom by the right divine caesarian glory force fanaticism irresponsible power and absolute majesty a rabble stupidly occupied in the contemplation in their twilight splendor of these sombre triumphs of the night down with the tyrant of whom are you speaking do you call louis philippe the tyrant no no more than louis xvi both of them are what history is in the habit of calling good kings but principles are not to be parcelled out the logic of the true is rectilinear the peculiarity of truth is that it lacks complaisance no concessions then all encroachments on man should be repressed there is a divine right in louis xvi there is because a bourbon in louis philippe both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of right and in order to clear away universal insurrection they must be combated it must be done france being always the one to begin when the master falls in france he falls everywhere in short what cause is more just and consequently what war is greater than that which re establishes social truth restores her throne to liberty restores the people to the
1682,people restores sovereignty to man replaces the purple on the head of france restores equity and reason in their plenitude suppresses every germ of antagonism by restoring each one to himself annihilates the obstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord and places the human race once more on a level with the right these wars build up peace an enormous fortress of prejudices privileges superstitions lies exactions abuses violences iniquities and darkness still stands erect in this world with its towers of hatred it must be cast down this monstrous mass must be made to crumble to conquer at austerlitz is grand to take the bastille is immense there is no one who has not noticed it in his own case the soul and therein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with ubiquity has a strange aptitude for reasoning almost coldly in the most violent extremities and it often happens that heartbroken passion and profound despair in the very agony of their blackest monologues treat subjects and discuss theses logic is mingled with convulsion and the thread of the syllogism floats without breaking in the mournful storm of thought this was the situation of marius mind
1683,as he meditated thus dejected but resolute hesitating in every direction and in short shuddering at what he was about to do his glance strayed to the interior of the barricade the insurgents were here conversing in a low voice without moving and there was perceptible that quasi silence which marks the last stage of expectation overhead at the small window in the third story marius descried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly attentive this was the porter who had been killed by le cabuc below by the lights of the torch which was thrust between the paving stones this head could be vaguely distinguished nothing could be stranger in that sombre and uncertain gleam than that livid motionless astonished face with its bristling hair its eyes fixed and staring and its yawning mouth bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity one would have said that the man who was dead was surveying those who were about to die a long trail of blood which had flowed from that head descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first floor where it stopped fourteenth the grandeurs of despair i
1684,the flag act first as yet nothing had come ten o'clock had sounded from saint merry enjolras and combeferre had gone and seated themselves carbines in hand near the outlet of the grand barricade they no longer addressed each other they listened seeking to catch even the faintest and most distant sound of marching suddenly in the midst of the dismal calm a clear gay young voice which seemed to come from the rue saint denis rose and began to sing distinctly to the old popular air of by the light of the moon this bit of poetry terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock mon nez est en larmes mon ami bugeaud prete moi tes gendarmes pour leur dire un mot en capote bleue la poule au shako voici la banlieue co cocorico they pressed each other's hands that is gavroche said enjolras he is warning us said combeferre a hasty rush troubled the deserted street they beheld a being more agile than a clown climb over the omnibus and gavroche bounded into the barricade all breathless saying my gun here they are an electric quiver shot through the whole barricade and the sound of hands
1685,seeking their guns became audible would you like my carbine said enjolras to the lad i want a big gun replied gavroche and he seized javert's gun two sentinels had fallen back and had come in almost at the same moment as gavroche they were the sentinels from the end of the street and the vidette of the rue de la petite truanderie the vidette of the lane des precheurs had remained at his post which indicated that nothing was approaching from the direction of the bridges and halles the rue de la chanvrerie of which a few paving stones alone were dimly visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag offered to the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a smoke each man had taken up his position for the conflict forty three insurgents among whom were enjolras combeferre courfeyrac bossuet joly bahorel and gavroche were kneeling inside the large barricade with their heads on a level with the crest of the barrier the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as though at loop holes attentive mute ready to fire six commanded by feuilly had installed themselves
1686,with their guns levelled at their shoulders at the windows of the two stories of corinthe several minutes passed thus then a sound of footsteps measured heavy and numerous became distinctly audible in the direction of saint leu this sound faint at first then precise then heavy and sonorous approached slowly without halt without intermission with a tranquil and terrible continuity nothing was to be heard but this it was that combined silence and sound of the statue of the commander but this stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it which awakened the idea of a throng and at the same time the idea of a spectre one thought one heard the terrible statue legion marching onward this tread drew near it drew still nearer and stopped it seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of the street nothing was to be seen however but at the bottom of that dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic threads as fine as needles and almost imperceptible which moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneath one's closed eyelids in the first mists of slumber at
1687,the moment when one is dropping off to sleep these were bayonets and gun barrels confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch a pause ensued as though both sides were waiting all at once from the depths of this darkness a voice which was all the more sinister since no one was visible and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking shouted who goes there at the same time the click of guns as they were lowered into position was heard enjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone the french revolution fire shouted the voice a flash empurpled all the facades in the street as though the door of a furnace had been flung open and hastily closed again a fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade the red flag fell the discharge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the staff that is to say the very tip of the omnibus pole bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated the barricade and wounded several men the impression produced by this first discharge was freezing the attack had been rough and of a nature to inspire reflection in
1688,the boldest it was evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment at the very least comrades shouted courfeyrac let us not waste our powder let us wait until they are in the street before replying and above all said enjolras let us raise the flag again he picked up the flag which had fallen precisely at his feet outside the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard the troops were re loading their arms enjolras went on who is there here with a bold heart who will plant the flag on the barricade again not a man responded to mount on the barricade at the very moment when without any doubt it was again the object of their aim was simply death the bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation enjolras himself felt a thrill he repeated does no one volunteer ii the flag act second since they had arrived at corinthe and had begun the construction of the barricade no attention had been paid to father mabeuf m mabeuf had not quitted the mob however he had entered the ground floor of the wine shop and had seated himself behind the counter there
1689,he had so to speak retreated into himself he no longer seemed to look or to think courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times warning him of his peril beseeching him to withdraw but he did not hear them when they were not speaking to him his mouth moved as though he were replying to some one and as soon as he was addressed his lips became motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive several hours before the barricade was attacked he had assumed an attitude which he did not afterwards abandon with both fists planted on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a precipice nothing had been able to move him from this attitude it did not seem as though his mind were in the barricade when each had gone to take up his position for the combat there remained in the tap room where javert was bound to the post only a single insurgent with a naked sword watching over javert and himself mabeuf at the moment of the attack at the detonation the physical shock had reached him and had as it
1690,were awakened him he started up abruptly crossed the room and at the instant when enjolras repeated his appeal does no one volunteer the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold of the wine shop his presence produced a sort of commotion in the different groups a shout went up it is the voter it is the member of the convention it is the representative of the people it is probable that he did not hear them he strode straight up to enjolras the insurgents withdrawing before him with a religious fear he tore the flag from enjolras who recoiled in amazement and then since no one dared to stop or to assist him this old man of eighty with shaking head but firm foot began slowly to ascend the staircase of paving stones arranged in the barricade this was so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried off with your hats at every step that he mounted it was a frightful spectacle his white locks his decrepit face his lofty bald and wrinkled brow his amazed and open mouth his aged arm upholding the red banner rose through the gloom and were enlarged
1691,in the bloody light of the torch and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of emerging from the earth with the flag of terror in his hand when he had reached the last step when this trembling and terrible phantom erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve hundred invisible guns drew himself up in the face of death and as though he were more powerful than it the whole barricade assumed amid the darkness a supernatural and colossal form there ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence of prodigies in the midst of this silence the old man waved the red flag and shouted long live the revolution long live the republic fraternity equality and death those in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper like the murmur of a priest who is despatching a prayer in haste it was probably the commissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other end of the street then the same piercing voice which had shouted who goes there shouted retire m mabeuf pale haggard his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame of aberration raised the flag above
1692,his head and repeated long live the republic fire said the voice a second discharge similar to the first rained down upon the barricade the old man fell on his knees then rose again dropped the flag and fell backwards on the pavement like a log at full length with outstretched arms rivulets of blood flowed beneath him his aged head pale and sad seemed to be gazing at the sky one of those emotions which are superior to man which make him forget even to defend himself seized upon the insurgents and they approached the body with respectful awe what men these regicides were said enjolras courfeyrac bent down to enjolras ear this is for yourself alone i do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm but this man was anything rather than a regicide i knew him his name was father mabeuf i do not know what was the matter with him to day but he was a brave blockhead just look at his head the head of a blockhead and the heart of a brutus replied enjolras then he raised his voice citizens this is the example which the old give to the young we hesitated he came
1693,we were drawing back he advanced this is what those who are trembling with age teach to those who tremble with fear this aged man is august in the eyes of his country he has had a long life and a magnificent death now let us place the body under cover that each one of us may defend this old man dead as he would his father living and may his presence in our midst render the barricade impregnable a murmur of gloomy and energetic assent followed these words enjolras bent down raised the old man's head and fierce as he was he kissed him on the brow then throwing wide his arms and handling this dead man with tender precaution as though he feared to hurt it he removed his coat showed the bloody holes in it to all and said this is our flag now iii gavroche would have done better to accept enjolras carbine they threw a long black shawl of widow hucheloup's over father mabeuf six men made a litter of their guns on this they laid the body and bore it with bared heads with solemn slowness to the large table in the tap room
1694,these men wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in which they were engaged thought no more of the perilous situation in which they stood when the corpse passed near javert who was still impassive enjolras said to the spy it will be your turn presently during all this time little gavroche who alone had not quitted his post but had remained on guard thought he espied some men stealthily approaching the barricade all at once he shouted look out courfeyrac enjolras jean prouvaire combeferre joly bahorel bossuet and all the rest ran tumultuously from the wine shop it was almost too late they saw a glistening density of bayonets undulating above the barricade municipal guards of lofty stature were making their way in some striding over the omnibus others through the cut thrusting before them the urchin who retreated but did not flee the moment was critical it was that first redoubtable moment of inundation when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when the water begins to filter through the fissures of dike a second more and the barricade would have been taken bahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering and
1695,killed him on the spot with a blow from his gun the second killed bahorel with a blow from his bayonet another had already overthrown courfeyrac who was shouting follow me the largest of all a sort of colossus marched on gavroche with his bayonet fixed the urchin took in his arms javert's immense gun levelled it resolutely at the giant and fired no discharge followed javert's gun was not loaded the municipal guard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the child before the bayonet had touched gavroche the gun slipped from the soldier's grasp a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the centre of the forehead and he fell over on his back a second bullet struck the other guard who had assaulted courfeyrac in the breast and laid him low on the pavement this was the work of marius who had just entered the barricade iv the barrel of powder marius still concealed in the turn of the rue mondetour had witnessed shuddering and irresolute the first phase of the combat but he had not long been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which may be designated as the call of the
1696,abyss in the presence of the imminence of the peril in the presence of the death of m mabeuf that melancholy enigma in the presence of bahorel killed and courfeyrac shouting follow me of that child threatened of his friends to succor or to avenge all hesitation had vanished and he had flung himself into the conflict his two pistols in hand with his first shot he had saved gavroche and with the second delivered courfeyrac amid the sound of the shots amid the cries of the assaulted guards the assailants had climbed the entrenchment on whose summit municipal guards soldiers of the line and national guards from the suburbs could now be seen gun in hand rearing themselves to more than half the height of their bodies they already covered more than two thirds of the barrier but they did not leap into the enclosure as though wavering in the fear of some trap they gazed into the dark barricade as one would gaze into a lion's den the light of the torch illuminated only their bayonets their bear skin caps and the upper part of their uneasy and angry faces marius had no longer any weapons he had
1697,flung away his discharged pistols after firing them but he had caught sight of the barrel of powder in the tap room near the door as he turned half round gazing in that direction a soldier took aim at him at the moment when the soldier was sighting marius a hand was laid on the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it this was done by some one who had darted forward the young workman in velvet trousers the shot sped traversed the hand and possibly also the workman since he fell but the ball did not strike marius all this which was rather to be apprehended than seen through the smoke marius who was entering the tap room hardly noticed still he had in a confused way perceived that gun barrel aimed at him and the hand which had blocked it and he had heard the discharge but in moments like this the things which one sees vacillate and are precipitated and one pauses for nothing one feels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still and all is cloud the insurgents surprised but not terrified had rallied enjolras had shouted wait don't fire at random in the first confusion they
1698,might in fact wound each other the majority of them had ascended to the window on the first story and to the attic windows whence they commanded the assailants the most determined with enjolras courfeyrac jean prouvaire and combeferre had proudly placed themselves with their backs against the houses at the rear unsheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers and guards who crowned the barricade all this was accomplished without haste with that strange and threatening gravity which precedes engagements they took aim point blank on both sides they were so close that they could talk together without raising their voices when they had reached this point where the spark is on the brink of darting forth an officer in a gorget extended his sword and said lay down your arms fire replied enjolras the two discharges took place at the same moment and all disappeared in smoke an acrid and stifling smoke in which dying and wounded lay with weak dull groans when the smoke cleared away the combatants on both sides could be seen to be thinned out but still in the same positions reloading in silence all at once a thundering voice was heard shouting be off
1699,with you or i'll blow up the barricade all turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded marius had entered the tap room and had seized the barrel of powder then he had taken advantage of the smoke and the sort of obscure mist which filled the entrenched enclosure to glide along the barricade as far as that cage of paving stones where the torch was fixed to tear it from the torch to replace it by the barrel of powder to thrust the pile of stones under the barrel which was instantly staved in with a sort of horrible obedience all this had cost marius but the time necessary to stoop and rise again and now all national guards municipal guards officers soldiers huddled at the other extremity of the barricade gazed stupidly at him as he stood with his foot on the stones his torch in his hand his haughty face illuminated by a fatal resolution drooping the flame of the torch towards that redoubtable pile where they could make out the broken barrel of powder and giving vent to that startling cry be off with you or i'll blow up the barricade marius on that barricade after
1700,the octogenarian was the vision of the young revolution after the apparition of the old blow up the barricade said a sergeant and yourself with it marius retorted and myself also and he dropped the torch towards the barrel of powder but there was no longer any one on the barrier the assailants abandoning their dead and wounded flowed back pell mell and in disorder towards the extremity of the street and there were again lost in the night it was a headlong flight the barricade was free v end of the verses of jean prouvaire all flocked around marius courfeyrac flung himself on his neck here you are what luck said combeferre you came in opportunely ejaculated bossuet if it had not been for you i should have been dead began courfeyrac again if it had not been for you i should have been gobbled up added gavroche marius asked where is the chief you are he said enjolras marius had had a furnace in his brain all day long now it was a whirlwind this whirlwind which was within him produced on him the effect of being outside of him and of bearing him away it seemed to
1701,him that he was already at an immense distance from life his two luminous months of joy and love ending abruptly at that frightful precipice cosette lost to him that barricade m mabeuf getting himself killed for the republic himself the leader of the insurgents all these things appeared to him like a tremendous nightmare he was obliged to make a mental effort to recall the fact that all that surrounded him was real marius had already seen too much of life not to know that nothing is more imminent than the impossible and that what it is always necessary to foresee is the unforeseen he had looked on at his own drama as a piece which one does not understand in the mists which enveloped his thoughts he did not recognize javert who bound to his post had not so much as moved his head during the whole of the attack on the barricade and who had gazed on the revolt seething around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of a judge marius had not even seen him in the meanwhile the assailants did not stir they could be heard marching and swarming through at
1702,the end of the street but they did not venture into it either because they were awaiting orders or because they were awaiting reinforcements before hurling themselves afresh on this impregnable redoubt the insurgents had posted sentinels and some of them who were medical students set about caring for the wounded they had thrown the tables out of the wine shop with the exception of the two tables reserved for lint and cartridges and of the one on which lay father mabeuf they had added them to the barricade and had replaced them in the tap room with mattresses from the bed of the widow hucheloup and her servants on these mattresses they had laid the wounded as for the three poor creatures who inhabited corinthe no one knew what had become of them they were finally found however hidden in the cellar a poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade the roll was called one of the insurgents was missing and who was it one of the dearest one of the most valiant jean prouvaire he was sought among the wounded he was not there he was sought among the dead he was not there he was
1703,evidently a prisoner combeferre said to enjolras they have our friend we have their agent are you set on the death of that spy yes replied enjolras but less so than on the life of jean prouvaire this took place in the tap room near javert's post well resumed combeferre i am going to fasten my handkerchief to my cane and go as a flag of truce to offer to exchange our man for theirs listen said enjolras laying his hand on combeferre's arm at the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms they heard a manly voice shout vive la france long live france long live the future they recognized the voice of prouvaire a flash passed a report rang out silence fell again they have killed him exclaimed combeferre enjolras glanced at javert and said to him your friends have just shot you vi the agony of death after the agony of life a peculiarity of this species of war is that the attack of the barricades is almost always made from the front and that the assailants generally abstain from turning the position either because they fear ambushes or because they are afraid
1704,of getting entangled in the tortuous streets the insurgents whole attention had been directed therefore to the grand barricade which was evidently the spot always menaced and there the struggle would infallibly recommence but marius thought of the little barricade and went thither it was deserted and guarded only by the fire pot which trembled between the paving stones moreover the mondetour alley and the branches of the rue de la petite truanderie and the rue du cygne were profoundly calm as marius was withdrawing after concluding his inspection he heard his name pronounced feebly in the darkness monsieur marius he started for he recognized the voice which had called to him two hours before through the gate in the rue plumet only the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath he looked about him but saw no one marius thought he had been mistaken that it was an illusion added by his mind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing around him he advanced a step in order to quit the distant recess where the barricade lay monsieur marius repeated the voice this time he could not doubt that he had heard it distinctly he looked
1705,and saw nothing at your feet said the voice he bent down and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itself towards him it was crawling along the pavement it was this that had spoken to him the fire pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse torn trousers of coarse velvet bare feet and something which resembled a pool of blood marius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted towards him and which was saying to him you do not recognize me no eponine marius bent hastily down it was in fact that unhappy child she was dressed in men's clothes how come you here what are you doing here i am dying said she there are words and incidents which arouse dejected beings marius cried out with a start you are wounded wait i will carry you into the room they will attend to you there is it serious how must i take hold of you in order not to hurt you where do you suffer help my god but why did you come hither and he tried to pass his arm under her in order to raise her she uttered a feeble cry have
1706,i hurt you asked marius a little but i only touched your hand she raised her hand to marius and in the middle of that hand marius saw a black hole what is the matter with your hand said he it is pierced pierced yes what with a bullet how did you see a gun aimed at you yes and a hand stopping it it was mine marius was seized with a shudder what madness poor child but so much the better if that is all it is nothing let me carry you to a bed they will dress your wound one does not die of a pierced hand she murmured the bullet traversed my hand but it came out through my back it is useless to remove me from this spot i will tell you how you can care for me better than any surgeon sit down near me on this stone he obeyed she laid her head on marius knees and without looking at him she said oh how good this is how comfortable this is there i no longer suffer she remained silent for a moment then she turned her face with an effort and looked at
1707,marius do you know what monsieur marius it puzzled me because you entered that garden it was stupid because it was i who showed you that house and then i ought to have said to myself that a young man like you she paused and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly existed in her mind she resumed with a heartrending smile you thought me ugly didn't you she continued you see you are lost now no one can get out of the barricade it was i who led you here by the way you are going to die i count upon that and yet when i saw them taking aim at you i put my hand on the muzzle of the gun how queer it is but it was because i wanted to die before you when i received that bullet i dragged myself here no one saw me no one picked me up i was waiting for you i said so he is not coming oh if you only knew i bit my blouse i suffered so now i am well do you remember the day i entered your chamber and when i looked at myself in your mirror
1708,and the day when i came to you on the boulevard near the washerwomen how the birds sang that was a long time ago you gave me a hundred sous and i said to you i don't want your money i hope you picked up your coin you are not rich i did not think to tell you to pick it up the sun was shining bright and it was not cold do you remember monsieur marius oh how happy i am every one is going to die she had a mad grave and heart breaking air her torn blouse disclosed her bare throat as she talked she pressed her pierced hand to her breast where there was another hole and whence there spurted from moment to moment a stream of blood like a jet of wine from an open bung hole marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion oh she resumed it is coming again i am stifling she caught up her blouse and bit it and her limbs stiffened on the pavement at that moment the young cock's crow executed by little gavroche resounded through the barricade the child had mounted a table to load his
1709,gun and was singing gayly the song then so popular en voyant lafayette on beholding lafayette le gendarme repete the gendarme repeats sauvons nous sauvons nous let us flee let us flee sauvons nous let us flee eponine raised herself and listened then she murmured it is he and turning to marius my brother is here he must not see me he would scold me your brother inquired marius who was meditating in the most bitter and sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the thenardiers which his father had bequeathed to him who is your brother that little fellow the one who is singing yes marius made a movement oh don't go away said she it will not be long now she was sitting almost upright but her voice was very low and broken by hiccoughs at intervals the death rattle interrupted her she put her face as near that of marius as possible she added with a strange expression listen i do not wish to play you a trick i have a letter in my pocket for you i was told to put it in the post i kept it i did not want to have
1710,it reach you but perhaps you will be angry with me for it when we meet again presently take your letter she grasped marius hand convulsively with her pierced hand but she no longer seemed to feel her sufferings she put marius hand in the pocket of her blouse there in fact marius felt a paper take it said she marius took the letter she made a sign of satisfaction and contentment now for my trouble promise me and she stopped what asked marius promise me i promise promise to give me a kiss on my brow when i am dead i shall feel it she dropped her head again on marius knees and her eyelids closed he thought the poor soul had departed eponine remained motionless all at once at the very moment when marius fancied her asleep forever she slowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity of death and said to him in a tone whose sweetness seemed already to proceed from another world and by the way monsieur marius i believe that i was a little bit in love with you she tried to smile once more and expired vii gavroche as a profound
1711,calculator of distances marius kept his promise he dropped a kiss on that livid brow where the icy perspiration stood in beads this was no infidelity to cosette it was a gentle and pensive farewell to an unhappy soul it was not without a tremor that he had taken the letter which eponine had given him he had immediately felt that it was an event of weight he was impatient to read it the heart of man is so constituted that the unhappy child had hardly closed her eyes when marius began to think of unfolding this paper he laid her gently on the ground and went away something told him that he could not peruse that letter in the presence of that body he drew near to a candle in the tap room it was a small note folded and sealed with a woman's elegant care the address was in a woman's hand and ran to monsieur monsieur marius pontmercy at m courfeyrac's rue de la verrerie no he broke the seal and read my dearest alas my father insists on our setting out immediately we shall be this evening in the rue de l'homme arme no in a
1712,week we shall be in england cosette june th such was the innocence of their love that marius was not even acquainted with cosette's handwriting what had taken place may be related in a few words eponine had been the cause of everything after the evening of the d of june she had cherished a double idea to defeat the projects of her father and the ruffians on the house of the rue plumet and to separate marius and cosette she had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came across who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman while eponine disguised herself like a man it was she who had conveyed to jean valjean in the champ de mars the expressive warning leave your house jean valjean had in fact returned home and had said to cosette we set out this evening and we go to the rue de l'homme arme with toussaint next week we shall be in london cosette utterly overwhelmed by this unexpected blow had hastily penned a couple of lines to marius but how was she to get the letter to the post she never went out alone and toussaint surprised at
1713,such a commission would certainly show the letter to m fauchelevent in this dilemma cosette had caught sight through the fence of eponine in man's clothes who now prowled incessantly around the garden cosette had called to this young workman and had handed him five francs and the letter saying carry this letter immediately to its address eponine had put the letter in her pocket the next day on the th of june she went to courfeyrac's quarters to inquire for marius not for the purpose of delivering the letter but a thing which every jealous and loving soul will comprehend to see there she had waited for marius or at least for courfeyrac still for the purpose of seeing when courfeyrac had told her we are going to the barricades an idea flashed through her mind to fling herself into that death as she would have done into any other and to thrust marius into it also she had followed courfeyrac had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of construction and quite certain since marius had received no warning and since she had intercepted the letter that he would go at dusk to his
1714,trysting place for every evening she had betaken herself to the rue plumet had there awaited marius and had sent him in the name of his friends the appeal which would she thought lead him to the barricade she reckoned on marius despair when he should fail to find cosette she was not mistaken she had returned to the rue de la chanvrerie herself what she did there the reader has just seen she died with the tragic joy of jealous hearts who drag the beloved being into their own death and who say no one shall have him marius covered cosette's letter with kisses so she loved him for one moment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now then he said to himself she is going away her father is taking her to england and my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage nothing is changed in our fates dreamers like marius are subject to supreme attacks of dejection and desperate resolves are the result the fatigue of living is insupportable death is sooner over with then he reflected that he had still two duties to fulfil to inform cosette of his death and
1715,send her a final farewell and to save from the impending catastrophe which was in preparation that poor child eponine's brother and thenardier's son he had a pocket book about him the same one which had contained the note book in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love for cosette he tore out a leaf and wrote on it a few lines in pencil our marriage was impossible i asked my grandfather he refused i have no fortune neither hast thou i hastened to thee thou wert no longer there thou knowest the promise that i gave thee i shall keep it i die i love thee when thou readest this my soul will be near thee and thou wilt smile having nothing wherewith to seal this letter he contented himself with folding the paper in four and added the address to mademoiselle cosette fauchelevent at m fauchelevent's rue de l'homme arme no having folded the letter he stood in thought for a moment drew out his pocket book again opened it and wrote with the same pencil these four lines on the first page my name is marius pontmercy carry my body to my grandfather m gillenormand
1716,rue des filles du calvaire no in the marais he put his pocketbook back in his pocket then he called gavroche the gamin at the sound of marius voice ran up to him with his merry and devoted air will you do something for me anything said gavroche good god if it had not been for you i should have been done for do you see this letter yes take it leave the barricade instantly gavroche began to scratch his ear uneasily and to morrow morning you will deliver it at its address to mademoiselle cosette at m fauchelevent's rue de l'homme arme no the heroic child replied well but in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken and i shall not be there the barricade will not be attacked until daybreak according to all appearances and will not be taken before to morrow noon the fresh respite which the assailants were granting to the barricade had in fact been prolonged it was one of those intermissions which frequently occur in nocturnal combats which are always followed by an increase of rage well said gavroche what if i were to go and carry your letter to morrow it will be
1717,too late the barricade will probably be blockaded all the streets will be guarded and you will not be able to get out go at once gavroche could think of no reply to this and stood there in indecision scratching his ear sadly all at once he took the letter with one of those birdlike movements which were common with him all right said he and he started off at a run through mondetour lane an idea had occurred to gavroche which had brought him to a decision but he had not mentioned it for fear that marius might offer some objection to it this was the idea it is barely midnight the rue de l'homme arme is not far off i will go and deliver the letter at once and i shall get back in time fifteenth the rue de l'homme arme i a drinker is a babbler what are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections of the soul man is a depth still greater than the people jean valjean at that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval every sort of gulf had opened again within him he also was trembling like
1718,paris on the brink of an obscure and formidable revolution a few hours had sufficed to bring this about his destiny and his conscience had suddenly been covered with gloom of him also as well as of paris it might have been said two principles are face to face the white angel and the black angel are about to seize each other on the bridge of the abyss which of the two will hurl the other over who will carry the day on the evening preceding this same th of june jean valjean accompanied by cosette and toussaint had installed himself in the rue de l'homme arme a change awaited him there cosette had not quitted the rue plumet without making an effort at resistance for the first time since they had lived side by side cosette's will and the will of jean valjean had proved to be distinct and had been in opposition at least if they had not clashed there had been objections on one side and inflexibility on the other the abrupt advice leave your house hurled at jean valjean by a stranger had alarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory he thought that he
1719,had been traced and followed cosette had been obliged to give way both had arrived in the rue de l'homme arme without opening their lips and without uttering a word each being absorbed in his own personal preoccupation jean valjean so uneasy that he did not notice cosette's sadness cosette so sad that she did not notice jean valjean's uneasiness jean valjean had taken toussaint with him a thing which he had never done in his previous absences he perceived the possibility of not returning to the rue plumet and he could neither leave toussaint behind nor confide his secret to her besides he felt that she was devoted and trustworthy treachery between master and servant begins in curiosity now toussaint as though she had been destined to be jean valjean's servant was not curious she stammered in her peasant dialect of barneville i am made so i do my work the rest is no affair of mine in this departure from the rue plumet which had been almost a flight jean valjean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise baptized by cosette the inseparable full trunks would have required porters and porters are witnesses a fiacre had
1720,been summoned to the door on the rue de babylone and they had taken their departure it was with difficulty that toussaint had obtained permission to pack up a little linen and clothes and a few toilet articles cosette had taken only her portfolio and her blotting book jean valjean with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery of this departure had arranged to quit the pavilion of the rue plumet only at dusk which had allowed cosette time to write her note to marius they had arrived in the rue de l'homme arme after night had fully fallen they had gone to bed in silence the lodgings in the rue de l'homme arme were situated on a back court on the second floor and were composed of two sleeping rooms a dining room and a kitchen adjoining the dining room with a garret where there was a folding bed and which fell to toussaint's share the dining room was an antechamber as well and separated the two bedrooms the apartment was provided with all necessary utensils people re acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it human nature is so constituted hardly had jean valjean reached the
1721,rue de l'homme arme when his anxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated there are soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on the mind an obscure street peaceable inhabitants jean valjean experienced an indescribable contagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient paris which is so narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse beam placed on two posts which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the clamorous city dimly lighted at mid day and is so to speak incapable of emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries old which hold their peace like ancients as they are there was a touch of stagnant oblivion in that street jean valjean drew his breath once more there how could he be found there his first care was to place the inseparable beside him he slept well night brings wisdom we may add night soothes on the following morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay he thought the dining room charming though it was hideous furnished with an old round table a long sideboard surmounted by a slanting mirror a dilapidated arm chair and several plain chairs which were encumbered with toussaint's
1722,packages in one of these packages jean valjean's uniform of a national guard was visible through a rent as for cosette she had had toussaint take some broth to her room and did not make her appearance until evening about five o'clock toussaint who was going and coming and busying herself with the tiny establishment set on the table a cold chicken which cosette out of deference to her father consented to glance at that done cosette under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache had bade jean valjean good night and had shut herself up in her chamber jean valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good appetite and with his elbows on the table having gradually recovered his serenity had regained possession of his sense of security while he was discussing this modest dinner he had twice or thrice noticed in a confused way toussaint's stammering words as she said to him monsieur there is something going on they are fighting in paris but absorbed in a throng of inward calculations he had paid no heed to it to tell the truth he had not heard her he rose and began to pace from the
1723,door to the window and from the window to the door growing ever more serene with this calm cosette his sole anxiety recurred to his thoughts not that he was troubled by this headache a little nervous crisis a young girl's fit of sulks the cloud of a moment there would be nothing left of it in a day or two but he meditated on the future and as was his habit he thought of it with pleasure after all he saw no obstacle to their happy life resuming its course at certain hours everything seems impossible at others everything appears easy jean valjean was in the midst of one of these good hours they generally succeed the bad ones as day follows night by virtue of that law of succession and of contrast which lies at the very foundation of nature and which superficial minds call antithesis in this peaceful street where he had taken refuge jean valjean got rid of all that had been troubling him for some time past this very fact that he had seen many shadows made him begin to perceive a little azure to have quitted the rue plumet without complications or incidents was
1724,one good step already accomplished perhaps it would be wise to go abroad if only for a few months and to set out for london well they would go what difference did it make to him whether he was in france or in england provided he had cosette beside him cosette was his nation cosette sufficed for his happiness the idea that he perhaps did not suffice for cosette's happiness that idea which had formerly been the cause of his fever and sleeplessness did not even present itself to his mind he was in a state of collapse from all his past sufferings and he was fully entered on optimism cosette was by his side she seemed to be his an optical illusion which every one has experienced he arranged in his own mind with all sorts of felicitous devices his departure for england with cosette and he beheld his felicity reconstituted wherever he pleased in the perspective of his revery as he paced to and fro with long strides his glance suddenly encountered something strange in the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard he saw the four lines which follow my dearest alas my father insists on
1725,our setting out immediately we shall be this evening in the rue de l'homme arme no in a week we shall be in england cosette june th jean valjean halted perfectly haggard cosette on her arrival had placed her blotting book on the sideboard in front of the mirror and utterly absorbed in her agony of grief had forgotten it and left it there without even observing that she had left it wide open and open at precisely the page on which she had laid to dry the four lines which she had penned and which she had given in charge of the young workman in the rue plumet the writing had been printed off on the blotter the mirror reflected the writing the result was what is called in geometry the symmetrical image so that the writing reversed on the blotter was righted in the mirror and presented its natural appearance and jean valjean had beneath his eyes the letter written by cosette to marius on the preceding evening it was simple and withering jean valjean stepped up to the mirror he read the four lines again but he did not believe them they produced on him the effect
1726,of appearing in a flash of lightning it was a hallucination it was impossible it was not so little by little his perceptions became more precise he looked at cosette's blotting book and the consciousness of the reality returned to him he caught up the blotter and said it comes from there he feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter the reversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl and he saw no sense in it then he said to himself but this signifies nothing there is nothing written here and he drew a long breath with inexpressible relief who has not experienced those foolish joys in horrible instants the soul does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted all illusions he held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the dupe all at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again and again he beheld the vision there were the four lines outlined with inexorable clearness this time it was no mirage the recurrence of a vision is a reality it was palpable it was the writing restored in
1727,the mirror he understood jean valjean tottered dropped the blotter and fell into the old arm chair beside the buffet with drooping head and glassy eyes in utter bewilderment he told himself that it was plain that the light of the world had been eclipsed forever and that cosette had written that to some one then he heard his soul which had become terrible once more give vent to a dull roar in the gloom try then the effect of taking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage strange and sad to say at that very moment marius had not yet received cosette's letter chance had treacherously carried it to jean valjean before delivering it to marius up to that day jean valjean had not been vanquished by trial he had been subjected to fearful proofs no violence of bad fortune had been spared him the ferocity of fate armed with all vindictiveness and all social scorn had taken him for her prey and had raged against him he had accepted every extremity when it had been necessary he had sacrificed his inviolability as a reformed man had yielded up his liberty risked his head lost
1728,everything suffered everything and he had remained disinterested and stoical to such a point that he might have been thought to be absent from himself like a martyr his conscience inured to every assault of destiny might have appeared to be forever impregnable well any one who had beheld his spiritual self would have been obliged to concede that it weakened at that moment it was because of all the tortures which he had undergone in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him this was the most terrible never had such pincers seized him hitherto he felt the mysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities he felt the plucking at the strange chord alas the supreme trial let us say rather the only trial is the loss of the beloved being poor old jean valjean certainly did not love cosette otherwise than as a father but we have already remarked above that into this paternity the widowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love he loved cosette as his daughter and he loved her as his mother and he loved her as his sister and as he had never had either a
1729,woman to love or a wife as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest that sentiment also the most impossible to lose was mingled with the rest vague ignorant pure with the purity of blindness unconscious celestial angelic divine less like a sentiment than like an instinct less like an instinct than like an imperceptible and invisible but real attraction and love properly speaking was in his immense tenderness for cosette like the thread of gold in the mountain concealed and virgin let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already indicated no marriage was possible between them not even that of souls and yet it is certain that their destinies were wedded with the exception of cosette that is to say with the exception of a childhood jean valjean had never in the whole of his long life known anything of that which may be loved the passions and loves which succeed each other had not produced in him those successive green growths tender green or dark green which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winter and in men who pass fifty in short and we have insisted on it more than
1730,once all this interior fusion all this whole of which the sum total was a lofty virtue ended in rendering jean valjean a father to cosette a strange father forged from the grandfather the son the brother and the husband that existed in jean valjean a father in whom there was included even a mother a father who loved cosette and adored her and who held that child as his light his home his family his country his paradise thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come that she was escaping from him that she was slipping from his hands that she was gliding from him like a cloud like water when he had before his eyes this crushing proof another is the goal of her heart another is the wish of her life there is a dearest one i am no longer anything but her father i no longer exist when he could no longer doubt when he said to himself she is going away from me the grief which he felt surpassed the bounds of possibility to have done all that he had done for the purpose of ending like this and the very idea of
1731,being nothing then as we have just said a quiver of revolt ran through him from head to foot he felt even in the very roots of his hair the immense reawakening of egotism and the i in this man's abyss howled there is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil a despairing certainty does not make its way into a man without thrusting aside and breaking certain profound elements which in some cases are the very man himself grief when it attains this shape is a headlong flight of all the forces of the conscience these are fatal crises few among us emerge from them still like ourselves and firm in duty when the limit of endurance is overstepped the most imperturbable virtue is disconcerted jean valjean took the blotter again and convinced himself afresh he remained bowed and as though petrified and with staring eyes over those four unobjectionable lines and there arose within him such a cloud that one might have thought that everything in this soul was crumbling away he examined this revelation athwart the exaggerations of revery with an apparent and terrifying calmness for it is a fearful thing when
1732,a man's calmness reaches the coldness of the statue he measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without his having a suspicion of the fact he recalled his fears of the preceding summer so foolishly dissipated he recognized the precipice it was still the same only jean valjean was no longer on the brink he was at the bottom of it the unprecedented and heart rending thing about it was that he had fallen without perceiving it all the light of his life had departed while he still fancied that he beheld the sun his instinct did not hesitate he put together certain circumstances certain dates certain blushes and certain pallors on cosette's part and he said to himself it is he the divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never misses its aim he struck marius with his first conjecture he did not know the name but he found the man instantly he distinctly perceived in the background of the implacable conjuration of his memories the unknown prowler of the luxembourg that wretched seeker of love adventures that idler of romance that idiot that coward for it is cowardly to come and make eyes
1733,at young girls who have beside them a father who loves them after he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man was at the bottom of this situation and that everything proceeded from that quarter he jean valjean the regenerated man the man who had so labored over his soul the man who had made so many efforts to resolve all life all misery and all unhappiness into love looked into his own breast and there beheld a spectre hate great griefs contain something of dejection they discourage one with existence the man into whom they enter feels something within him withdraw from him in his youth their visits are lugubrious later on they are sinister alas if despair is a fearful thing when the blood is hot when the hair is black when the head is erect on the body like the flame on the torch when the roll of destiny still retains its full thickness when the heart full of desirable love still possesses beats which can be returned to it when one has time for redress when all women and all smiles and all the future and all the horizon are before one when the
1734,force of life is complete what is it in old age when the years hasten on growing ever paler to that twilight hour when one begins to behold the stars of the tomb while he was meditating toussaint entered jean valjean rose and asked her in what quarter is it do you know toussaint was struck dumb and could only answer him what is it sir jean valjean began again did you not tell me that just now that there is fighting going on ah yes sir replied toussaint it is in the direction of saint merry there is a mechanical movement which comes to us unconsciously from the most profound depths of our thought it was no doubt under the impulse of a movement of this sort and of which he was hardly conscious that jean valjean five minutes later found himself in the street bareheaded he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house he seemed to be listening night had come ii the street urchin an enemy of light how long did he remain thus what was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation did he straighten up did he remain bowed had
1735,he been bent to breaking could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid he probably would not have been able to tell himself the street was deserted a few uneasy bourgeois who were rapidly returning home hardly saw him each one for himself in times of peril the lamp lighter came as usual to light the lantern which was situated precisely opposite the door of no and then went away jean valjean would not have appeared like a living man to any one who had examined him in that shadow he sat there on the post of his door motionless as a form of ice there is congealment in despair the alarm bells and a vague and stormy uproar were audible in the midst of all these convulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt the clock of saint paul struck eleven gravely and without haste for the tocsin is man the hour is god the passage of the hour produced no effect on jean valjean jean valjean did not stir still at about that moment a brusque report burst forth in the direction of the halles a second yet more violent followed it
1736,was probably that attack on the barricade in the rue de la chanvrerie which we have just seen repulsed by marius at this double discharge whose fury seemed augmented by the stupor of the night jean valjean started he rose turning towards the quarter whence the noise proceeded then he fell back upon the post again folded his arms and his head slowly sank on his bosom again he resumed his gloomy dialogue with himself all at once he raised his eyes some one was walking in the street he heard steps near him he looked and by the light of the lanterns in the direction of the street which ran into the rue aux archives he perceived a young livid and beaming face gavroche had just arrived in the rue l'homme arme gavroche was staring into the air apparently in search of something he saw jean valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him gavroche after staring into the air stared below he raised himself on tiptoe and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor they were all shut bolted and padlocked after having authenticated the fronts of five or six barricaded houses in
1737,this manner the urchin shrugged his shoulders and took himself to task in these terms pardi then he began to stare into the air again jean valjean who an instant previously in his then state of mind would not have spoken to or even answered any one felt irresistibly impelled to accost that child what is the matter with you my little fellow he said the matter with me is that i am hungry replied gavroche frankly and he added little fellow yourself jean valjean fumbled in his fob and pulled out a five franc piece but gavroche who was of the wagtail species and who skipped vivaciously from one gesture to another had just picked up a stone he had caught sight of the lantern see here said he you still have your lanterns here you are disobeying the regulations my friend this is disorderly smash that for me and he flung the stone at the lantern whose broken glass fell with such a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains in the opposite house cried there is ninety three come again the lantern oscillated violently and went out the street had suddenly become black that's right
1738,old street ejaculated gavroche put on your night cap and turning to jean valjean what do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end of the street it's the archives isn't it i must crumble up those big stupids of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them jean valjean stepped up to gavroche poor creature he said in a low tone and speaking to himself he is hungry and he laid the hundred sou piece in his hand gavroche raised his face astonished at the size of this sou he stared at it in the darkness and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him he knew five franc pieces by hearsay their reputation was agreeable to him he was delighted to see one close to he said let us contemplate the tiger he gazed at it for several minutes in ecstasy then turning to jean valjean he held out the coin to him and said majestically to him bourgeois i prefer to smash lanterns take back your ferocious beast you can't bribe me that has got five claws but it doesn't scratch me have you a mother asked jean valjean gavroche
1739,replied more than you have perhaps well returned jean valjean keep the money for your mother gavroche was touched moreover he had just noticed that the man who was addressing him had no hat and this inspired him with confidence truly said he so it wasn't to keep me from breaking the lanterns break whatever you please you're a fine man said gavroche and he put the five franc piece into one of his pockets his confidence having increased he added do you belong in this street yes why can you tell me where no is what do you want with no here the child paused he feared that he had said too much he thrust his nails energetically into his hair and contented himself with replying ah here it is an idea flashed through jean valjean's mind anguish does have these gleams he said to the lad are you the person who is bringing a letter that i am expecting you said gavroche you are not a woman the letter is for mademoiselle cosette is it not cosette muttered gavroche yes i believe that is the queer name well resumed jean valjean i am the person to whom you
1740,are to deliver the letter give it here in that case you must know that i was sent from the barricade of course said jean valjean gavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a paper folded in four then he made the military salute respect for despatches said he it comes from the provisional government give it to me said jean valjean gavroche held the paper elevated above his head don't go and fancy it's a love letter it is for a woman but it's for the people we men fight and we respect the fair sex we are not as they are in fine society where there are lions who send chickens to camels give it to me after all continued gavroche you have the air of an honest man give it to me quick catch hold of it and he handed the paper to jean valjean and make haste monsieur what's your name for mamselle cosette is waiting gavroche was satisfied with himself for having produced this remark jean valjean began again is it to saint merry that the answer is to be sent there you are making some of those bits of
1741,pastry vulgarly called brioches blunders this letter comes from the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie and i'm going back there good evening citizen that said gavroche took himself off or to describe it more exactly fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like that of an escaped bird he plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it with the rigid rapidity of a projectile the alley of l'homme arme became silent and solitary once more in a twinkling that strange child who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses and was lost there like smoke in the dark and one might have thought that he had dissipated and vanished had there not taken place a few minutes after his disappearance a startling shiver of glass and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois it was gavroche upon his way through the rue du chaume iii while cosette and toussaint are asleep jean valjean went into the house with marius
1742,letter he groped his way up the stairs as pleased with the darkness as an owl who grips his prey opened and shut his door softly listened to see whether he could hear any noise made sure that to all appearances cosette and toussaint were asleep and plunged three or four matches into the bottle of the fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark so greatly did his hand tremble what he had just done smacked of theft at last the candle was lighted he leaned his elbows on the table unfolded the paper and read in violent emotions one does not read one flings to the earth so to speak the paper which one holds one clutches it like a victim one crushes it one digs into it the nails of one's wrath or of one's joy one hastens to the end one leaps to the beginning attention is at fever heat it takes up in the gross as it were the essential points it seizes on one point and the rest disappears in marius note to cosette jean valjean saw only these words i die when thou readest this my soul will be near thee in the
1743,presence of these two lines he was horribly dazzled he remained for a moment crushed as it were by the change of emotion which was taking place within him he stared at marius note with a sort of intoxicated amazement he had before his eyes that splendor the death of a hated individual he uttered a frightful cry of inward joy so it was all over the catastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope the being who obstructed his destiny was disappearing that man had taken himself off of his own accord freely willingly this man was going to his death and he jean valjean had had no hand in the matter and it was through no fault of his perhaps even he is already dead here his fever entered into calculations no he is not dead yet the letter had evidently been intended for cosette to read on the following morning after the two discharges that were heard between eleven o'clock and midnight nothing more has taken place the barricade will not be attacked seriously until daybreak but that makes no difference from the moment when that man is concerned in this war he is lost
1744,he is caught in the gearing jean valjean felt himself delivered so he was about to find himself alone with cosette once more the rivalry would cease the future was beginning again he had but to keep this note in his pocket cosette would never know what had become of that man all that there requires to be done is to let things take their own course this man cannot escape if he is not already dead it is certain that he is about to die what good fortune having said all this to himself he became gloomy then he went down stairs and woke up the porter about an hour later jean valjean went out in the complete costume of a national guard and with his arms the porter had easily found in the neighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment he had a loaded gun and a cartridge box filled with cartridges he strode off in the direction of the markets iv gavroche's excess of zeal in the meantime gavroche had had an adventure gavroche after having conscientiously stoned the lantern in the rue du chaume entered the rue des vielles haudriettes and not seeing even a cat
1745,there he thought the opportunity a good one to strike up all the song of which he was capable his march far from being retarded by his singing was accelerated by it he began to sow along the sleeping or terrified houses these incendiary couplets l'oiseau medit dans les charmilles et pretend qu'hier atala avec un russe s'en alla ou vont les belles filles lon la mon ami pierrot tu babilles parce que l'autre jour mila cogna sa vitre et m'appela ou vont les belles filles lon la les drolesses sont fort gentilles leur poison qui m'ensorcela griserait monsieur orfila ou vont les belles filles lon la j'aime l'amour et les bisbilles j'aime agnes j'aime pamela lisa en m'allumant se brula ou vont les belles filles lon la jadis quand je vis les mantilles de suzette et de zeila mon ame aleurs plis se mela ou vont les belles filles lon la amour quand dans l'ombre ou tu brilles tu coiffes de roses lola je me damnerais pour cela ou vont les belles filles lon la jeanne a ton miroir tu t'habilles mon coeur un beau jour s'envola je crois que c'est jeanne qui l'a ou vont les belles filles
1746,lon la le soir en sortant des quadrilles je montre aux etoiles stella et je leur dis regardez la ou vont les belles filles lon la gavroche as he sang was lavish of his pantomime gesture is the strong point of the refrain his face an inexhaustible repertory of masks produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a cloth torn in a high gale unfortunately as he was alone and as it was night this was neither seen nor even visible such wastes of riches do occur all at once he stopped short let us interrupt the romance said he his feline eye had just descried in the recess of a carriage door what is called in painting an ensemble that is to say a person and a thing the thing was a hand cart the person was a man from auvergene who was sleeping therein the shafts of the cart rested on the pavement and the auvergnat's head was supported against the front of the cart his body was coiled up on this inclined plane and his feet touched the ground gavroche with his experience of the things of this world recognized a drunken man
1747,he was some corner errand man who had drunk too much and was sleeping too much there now thought gavroche that's what the summer nights are good for we'll take the cart for the republic and leave the auvergnat for the monarchy his mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light how bully that cart would look on our barricade the auvergnat was snoring gavroche gently tugged at the cart from behind and at the auvergnat from the front that is to say by the feet and at the expiration of another minute the imperturbable auvergnat was reposing flat on the pavement the cart was free gavroche habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters had everything about him he fumbled in one of his pockets and pulled from it a scrap of paper and a bit of red pencil filched from some carpenter he wrote french republic received thy cart and he signed it gavroche that done he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring auvergnat's velvet vest seized the cart shafts in both hands and set off in the direction of the halles pushing the cart before him at a hard gallop with
1748,a glorious and triumphant uproar this was perilous there was a post at the royal printing establishment gavroche did not think of this this post was occupied by the national guards of the suburbs the squad began to wake up and heads were raised from camp beds two street lanterns broken in succession that ditty sung at the top of the lungs this was a great deal for those cowardly streets which desire to go to sleep at sunset and which put the extinguisher on their candles at such an early hour for the last hour that boy had been creating an uproar in that peaceable arrondissement the uproar of a fly in a bottle the sergeant of the banlieue lent an ear he waited he was a prudent man the mad rattle of the cart filled to overflowing the possible measure of waiting and decided the sergeant to make a reconnaisance there's a whole band of them there said he let us proceed gently it was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its box and that it was stalking abroad through the quarter and the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread all at
1749,once gavroche pushing his cart in front of him and at the very moment when he was about to turn into the rue des vielles haudriettes found himself face to face with a uniform a shako a plume and a gun for the second time he stopped short hullo said he it's him good day public order gavroche's amazement was always brief and speedily thawed where are you going you rascal shouted the sergeant citizen retorted gavroche i haven't called you bourgeois yet why do you insult me where are you going you rogue monsieur retorted gavroche perhaps you were a man of wit yesterday but you have degenerated this morning i ask you where are you going you villain gavroche replied you speak prettily really no one would suppose you as old as you are you ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece that would yield you five hundred francs where are you going where are you going where are you going bandit gavroche retorted again what villainous words you must wipe your mouth better the first time that they give you suck the sergeant lowered his bayonet will you tell me where you are
1750,going you wretch general said gavroche i'm on my way to look for a doctor for my wife who is in labor to arms shouted the sergeant the master stroke of strong men consists in saving themselves by the very means that have ruined them gavroche took in the whole situation at a glance it was the cart which had told against him it was the cart's place to protect him at the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent on gavroche the cart converted into a projectile and launched with all the latter's might rolled down upon him furiously and the sergeant struck full in the stomach tumbled over backwards into the gutter while his gun went off in the air the men of the post had rushed out pell mell at the sergeant's shout the shot brought on a general random discharge after which they reloaded their weapons and began again this blind man's buff musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour and killed several panes of glass in the meanwhile gavroche who had retraced his steps at full speed halted five or six streets distant and seated himself panting on the
1751,stone post which forms the corner of the enfants rouges he listened after panting for a few minutes he turned in the direction where the fusillade was raging lifted his left hand to a level with his nose and thrust it forward three times as he slapped the back of his head with his right hand an imperious gesture in which parisian street urchindom has condensed french irony and which is evidently efficacious since it has already lasted half a century this gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection yes said he i'm splitting with laughter i'm twisting with delight i abound in joy but i'm losing my way i shall have to take a roundabout way if i only reach the barricade in season thereupon he set out again on a run and as he ran ah by the way where was i said he and he resumed his ditty as he plunged rapidly through the streets and this is what died away in the gloom mais il reste encore des bastilles et je vais mettre le hola dans l'orde public que voila ou vont les belles filles lon la quelqu'un veut il jouer aux quilles tout l'ancien monde
1752,s'ecroula quand la grosse boule roula ou vont les belles filles lon la vieux bon peuple a coups de bequilles cassons ce louvre ou s'etala la monarchie en falbala ou vont les belles filles lon la nous en avons force les grilles le roi charles dix ce jour la tenait mal et se decolla ou vont les belles filles lon la the post's recourse to arms was not without result the cart was conquered the drunken man was taken prisoner the first was put in the pound the second was later on somewhat harassed before the councils of war as an accomplice the public ministry of the day proved its indefatigable zeal in the defence of society in this instance gavroche's adventure which has lingered as a tradition in the quarters of the temple is one of the most terrible souvenirs of the elderly bourgeois of the marais and is entitled in their memories the nocturnal attack by the post of the royal printing establishment the end of iv saint denis v jean valjean first the war between four walls i the charybdis of the faubourg saint antoine and the scylla of the faubourg du temple the two most memorable
1753,barricades which the observer of social maladies can name do not belong to the period in which the action of this work is laid these two barricades both of them symbols under two different aspects of a redoubtable situation sprang from the earth at the time of the fatal insurrection of june the greatest war of the streets that history has ever beheld it sometimes happens that even contrary to principles even contrary to liberty equality and fraternity even contrary to the universal vote even contrary to the government by all for all from the depths of its anguish of its discouragements and its destitutions of its fevers of its distresses of its miasmas of its ignorances of its darkness that great and despairing body the rabble protests against and that the populace wages battle against the people beggars attack the common right the ochlocracy rises against demos these are melancholy days for there is always a certain amount of night even in this madness there is suicide in this duel and those words which are intended to be insults beggars canaille ochlocracy populace exhibit alas rather the fault of those who reign than the fault of those who suffer
1754,rather the fault of the privileged than the fault of the disinherited for our own part we never pronounce those words without pain and without respect for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which they correspond it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries athens was an ochlocracy the beggars were the making of holland the populace saved rome more than once and the rabble followed jesus christ there is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificences of the lower classes it was of this rabble that saint jerome was thinking no doubt and of all these poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserable people whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs when he uttered this mysterious saying fex urbis lex orbis the dregs of the city the law of the earth the exasperations of this crowd which suffers and bleeds its violences contrary to all sense directed against the principles which are its life its masterful deeds against the right are its popular coups d'etat and should be repressed the man of probity sacrifices himself and out of his very love for this crowd he combats it but how excusable he feels
1755,it even while holding out against it how he venerates it even while resisting it this is one of those rare moments when while doing that which it is one's duty to do one feels something which disconcerts one and which would dissuade one from proceeding further one persists it is necessary but conscience though satisfied is sad and the accomplishment of duty is complicated with a pain at the heart june let us hasten to say was an exceptional fact and almost impossible of classification in the philosophy of history all the words which we have just uttered must be discarded when it becomes a question of this extraordinary revolt in which one feels the holy anxiety of toil claiming its rights it was necessary to combat it and this was a duty for it attacked the republic but what was june at bottom a revolt of the people against itself where the subject is not lost sight of there is no digression may we then be permitted to arrest the reader's attention for a moment on the two absolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and which characterized this insurrection one blocked the entrance to the
1756,faubourg saint antoine the other defended the approach to the faubourg du temple those before whom these two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the brilliant blue sky of june will never forget them the saint antoine barricade was tremendous it was three stories high and seven hundred feet wide it barred the vast opening of the faubourg that is to say three streets from angle to angle ravined jagged cut up divided crenelated with an immense rent buttressed with piles that were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there powerfully backed up by two great promontories of houses of the faubourg it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the formidable place which had seen the th of july nineteen barricades were ranged one behind the other in the depths of the streets behind this principal barricade at the very sight of it one felt the agonizing suffering in the immense faubourg which had reached that point of extremity when a distress may become a catastrophe of what was that barricade made of the ruins of three six story houses demolished expressly said some of the prodigy of all wraths said others
1757,it wore the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred ruin it might be asked who built this it might also be said who destroyed this it was the improvisation of the ebullition hold take this door this grating this penthouse this chimney piece this broken brazier this cracked pot give all cast away all push this roll dig dismantle overturn ruin everything it was the collaboration of the pavement the block of stone the beam the bar of iron the rag the scrap the broken pane the unseated chair the cabbage stalk the tatter the rag and the malediction it was grand and it was petty it was the abyss parodied on the public place by hubbub the mass beside the atom the strip of ruined wall and the broken bowl threatening fraternization of every sort of rubbish sisyphus had thrown his rock there and job his potsherd terrible in short it was the acropolis of the barefooted overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope an immense dray was spread out there crossways its axle pointing heavenward and seemed a scar on that tumultuous facade an omnibus hoisted gayly by main force to the very summit of the
1758,heap as though the architects of this bit of savagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their terror presented its horseless unharnessed pole to no one knows what horses of the air this gigantic heap the alluvium of the revolt figured to the mind an ossa on pelion of all revolutions on the th of thermidor on the th of august the th of brumaire on the th of january vendemiaire on prairial on the situation deserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very spot whence the bastille had disappeared if the ocean made dikes it is thus that it would build the fury of the flood was stamped upon this shapeless mass what flood the crowd one thought one beheld hubbub petrified one thought one heard humming above this barricade as though there had been over their hive enormous dark bees of violent progress was it a thicket was it a bacchanalia was it a fortress vertigo seemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings there was something of the cess pool in that redoubt and something olympian in that confusion one there beheld in a
1759,pell mell full of despair the rafters of roofs bits of garret windows with their figured paper window sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting the cannon wrecks of chimneys cupboards tables benches howling topsyturveydom and those thousand poverty stricken things the very refuse of the mendicant which contain at the same time fury and nothingness one would have said that it was the tatters of a people rags of wood of iron of bronze of stone and that the faubourg saint antoine had thrust it there at its door with a colossal flourish of the broom making of its misery its barricade blocks resembling headsman's blocks dislocated chains pieces of woodwork with brackets having the form of gibbets horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the old tortures endured by the people the barricade saint antoine converted everything into a weapon everything that civil war could throw at the head of society proceeded thence it was not combat it was a paroxysm the carbines which defended this redoubt among which there were some blunderbusses sent bits of earthenware bones coat buttons even the casters from night stands
1760,dangerous projectiles on account of the brass this barricade was furious it hurled to the clouds an inexpressible clamor at certain moments when provoking the army it was covered with throngs and tempest a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads crowned it a swarm filled it it had a thorny crest of guns of sabres of cudgels of axes of pikes and of bayonets a vast red flag flapped in the wind shouts of command songs of attack the roll of drums the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving were to be heard there it was huge and living and like the back of an electric beast there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning the spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of god a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish it was a heap of filth and it was sinai as we have said previously it attacked in the name of the revolution what the revolution it that barricade chance hazard disorder terror misunderstanding the unknown had facing it the constituent assembly the sovereignty of the people
1761,universal suffrage the nation the republic and it was the carmagnole bidding defiance to the marseillaise immense but heroic defiance for the old faubourg is a hero the faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance the faubourg shouldered the redoubt the redoubt took its stand under cover of the faubourg the vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which the strategy of the african generals dashed itself its caverns its excrescences its warts its gibbosities grimaced so to speak and grinned beneath the smoke the mitraille vanished in shapelessness the bombs plunged into it bullets only succeeded in making holes in it what was the use of cannonading chaos and the regiments accustomed to the fiercest visions of war gazed with uneasy eyes on that species of redoubt a wild beast in its boar like bristling and a mountain by its enormous size a quarter of a league away from the corner of the rue du temple which debouches on the boulevard near the chateaud'eau if one thrust one's head bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the dallemagne shop one perceived in the distance beyond the canal in the street which mounts the slopes of
1762,belleville at the culminating point of the rise a strange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left as though the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order to close itself abruptly this wall was built of paving stones it was straight correct cold perpendicular levelled with the square laid out by rule and line cement was lacking of course but as in the case of certain roman walls without interfering with its rigid architecture the entablature was mathematically parallel with the base from distance to distance one could distinguish on the gray surface almost invisible loopholes which resembled black threads these loopholes were separated from each other by equal spaces the street was deserted as far as the eye could reach all windows and doors were closed in the background rose this barrier which made a blind thoroughfare of the street a motionless and tranquil wall no one was visible nothing was audible not a cry not a sound not a breath a sepulchre the dazzling sun of june inundated this terrible thing with light it was
1763,the barricade of the faubourg of the temple as soon as one arrived on the spot and caught sight of it it was impossible even for the boldest not to become thoughtful before this mysterious apparition it was adjusted jointed imbricated rectilinear symmetrical and funereal science and gloom met there one felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre one looked at it and spoke low from time to time if some soldier an officer or representative of the people chanced to traverse the deserted highway a faint sharp whistle was heard and the passer by fell dead or wounded or if he escaped the bullet sometimes a biscaien was seen to ensconce itself in some closed shutter in the interstice between two blocks of stone or in the plaster of a wall for the men in the barricade had made themselves two small cannons out of two cast iron lengths of gas pipe plugged up at one end with tow and fire clay there was no waste of useless powder nearly every shot told there were corpses here and there and pools of blood on the pavement i remember a white butterfly which went
1764,and came in the street summer does not abdicate in the neighborhood the spaces beneath the portes cocheres were encumbered with wounded one felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see and one understood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal forms at the entrance to the faubourg du temple the soldiers of the attacking column gravely and thoughtfully watched this dismal redoubt this immobility this passivity whence sprang death some crawled flat on their faces as far as the crest of the curve of the bridge taking care that their shakos did not project beyond it the valiant colonel monteynard admired this barricade with a shudder how that is built he said to a representative not one paving stone projects beyond its neighbor it is made of porcelain at that moment a bullet broke the cross on his breast and he fell the cowards people said let them show themselves let us see them they dare not they are hiding the barricade of the faubourg du temple defended by eighty men attacked by ten thousand held out for three days
1765,on the fourth they did as at zaatcha as at constantine they pierced the houses they came over the roofs the barricade was taken not one of the eighty cowards thought of flight all were killed there with the exception of the leader barthelemy of whom we shall speak presently the saint antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders the barricade of the temple was silence the difference between these two redoubts was the difference between the formidable and the sinister one seemed a maw the other a mask admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of june was composed of a wrath and of an enigma one divined in the first barricade the dragon and behind the second the sphinx these two fortresses had been erected by two men named the one cournet the other barthelemy cournet made the saint antoine barricade barthelemy the barricade of the temple each was the image of the man who had built it cournet was a man of lofty stature he had broad shoulders a red face a crushing fist a bold heart a loyal soul a sincere and terrible eye intrepid energetic irascible stormy the most cordial of men the most formidable
1766,of combatants war strife conflict were the very air he breathed and put him in a good humor he had been an officer in the navy and from his gestures and his voice one divined that he sprang from the ocean and that he came from the tempest he carried the hurricane on into battle with the exception of the genius there was in cournet something of danton as with the exception of the divinity there was in danton something of hercules barthelemy thin feeble pale taciturn was a sort of tragic street urchin who having had his ears boxed by a policeman lay in wait for him and killed him and at seventeen was sent to the galleys he came out and made this barricade later on fatal circumstance in london proscribed by all barthelemy slew cournet it was a funereal duel some time afterwards caught in the gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion plays a part a catastrophe in which french justice sees extenuating circumstances and in which english justice sees only death barthelemy was hanged the sombre social construction is so made that thanks to material destitution thanks to moral obscurity that unhappy
1767,being who possessed an intelligence certainly firm possibly great began in france with the galleys and ended in england with the gallows barthelemy on occasion flew but one flag the black flag ii what is to be done in the abyss if one does not converse sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection and june knew a great deal more about it than june so the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie was only an outline and an embryo compared to the two colossal barricades which we have just sketched but it was formidable for that epoch the insurgents under the eye of enjolras for marius no longer looked after anything had made good use of the night the barricade had been not only repaired but augmented they had raised it two feet bars of iron planted in the pavement resembled lances in rest all sorts of rubbish brought and added from all directions complicated the external confusion the redoubt had been cleverly made over into a wall on the inside and a thicket on the outside the staircase of paving stones which permitted one to mount it like the wall of a citadel had been reconstructed
1768,the barricade had been put in order the tap room disencumbered the kitchen appropriated for the ambulance the dressing of the wounded completed the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been gathered up bullets run cartridges manufactured lint scraped the fallen weapons re distributed the interior of the redoubt cleaned the rubbish swept up corpses removed they laid the dead in a heap in the mondetour lane of which they were still the masters the pavement was red for a long time at that spot among the dead there were four national guardsmen of the suburbs enjolras had their uniforms laid aside enjolras had advised two hours of sleep advice from enjolras was a command still only three or four took advantage of it feuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription on the wall which faced the tavern long live the peoples these four words hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail could be still read on the wall in the three women had profited by the respite of the night to vanish definitely which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely they had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring
1769,house the greater part of the wounded were able and wished to fight still on a litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen which had been converted into an ambulance there were five men gravely wounded two of whom were municipal guardsmen the municipal guardsmen were attended to first in the tap room there remained only mabeuf under his black cloth and javert bound to his post this is the hall of the dead said enjolras in the interior of this hall barely lighted by a candle at one end the mortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar a sort of vast vague cross resulted from javert erect and mabeuf lying prone the pole of the omnibus although snapped off by the fusillade was still sufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag to it enjolras who possessed that quality of a leader of always doing what he said attached to this staff the bullet ridden and bloody coat of the old man's no repast had been possible there was neither bread nor meat the fifty men in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty provisions of the wine shop during the sixteen
1770,hours which they had passed there at a given moment every barricade inevitably becomes the raft of la meduse they were obliged to resign themselves to hunger they had then reached the first hours of that spartan day of the th of june when in the barricade saint merry jeanne surrounded by the insurgents who demanded bread replied to all combatants crying something to eat with why it is three o'clock at four we shall be dead as they could no longer eat enjolras forbade them to drink he interdicted wine and portioned out the brandy they had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed enjolras and combeferre examined them combeferre when he came up again said it's the old stock of father hucheloup who began business as a grocer it must be real wine observed bossuet it's lucky that grantaire is asleep if he were on foot there would be a good deal of difficulty in saving those bottles enjolras in spite of all murmurs placed his veto on the fifteen bottles and in order that no one might touch them he had them placed under the table on which father mabeuf was lying about two o'clock
1771,in the morning they reckoned up their strength there were still thirty seven of them the day began to dawn the torch which had been replaced in its cavity in the pavement had just been extinguished the interior of the barricade that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from the street was bathed in shadows and resembled athwart the vague twilight horror the deck of a disabled ship the combatants as they went and came moved about there like black forms above that terrible nesting place of gloom the stories of the mute houses were lividly outlined at the very top the chimneys stood palely out the sky was of that charming undecided hue which may be white and may be blue birds flew about in it with cries of joy the lofty house which formed the back of the barricade being turned to the east had upon its roof a rosy reflection the morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head of the dead man at the third story window i am delighted that the torch has been extinguished said courfeyrac to feuilly that torch flickering in the wind annoyed me it had the appearance of being afraid the
1772,light of torches resembles the wisdom of cowards it gives a bad light because it trembles dawn awakens minds as it does the birds all began to talk joly perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter extracted philosophy from it what is the cat he exclaimed it is a corrective the good god having made the mouse said hullo i have committed a blunder and so he made the cat the cat is the erratum of the mouse the mouse plus the cat is the proof of creation revised and corrected combeferre surrounded by students and artisans was speaking of the dead of jean prouvaire of bahorel of mabeuf and even of cabuc and of enjolras sad severity he said harmodius and aristogiton brutus chereas stephanus cromwell charlotte corday sand have all had their moment of agony when it was too late our hearts quiver so and human life is such a mystery that even in the case of a civic murder even in a murder for liberation if there be such a thing the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the joy of having served the human race and such are the windings of the exchange of speech
1773,that a moment later by a transition brought about through jean prouvaire's verses combeferre was comparing the translators of the georgics raux with cournand cournand with delille pointing out the passages translated by malfilatre particularly the prodigies of caesar's death and at that word caesar the conversation reverted to brutus caesar said combeferre fell justly cicero was severe towards caesar and he was right that severity is not diatribe when zoilus insults homer when maevius insults virgil when vise insults moliere when pope insults shakspeare when frederic insults voltaire it is an old law of envy and hatred which is being carried out genius attracts insult great men are always more or less barked at but zoilus and cicero are two different persons cicero is an arbiter in thought just as brutus is an arbiter by the sword for my own part i blame that last justice the blade but antiquity admitted it caesar the violator of the rubicon conferring as though they came from him the dignities which emanated from the people not rising at the entrance of the senate committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant regia ac pene tyrannica he was a great
1774,man so much the worse or so much the better the lesson is but the more exalted his twenty three wounds touch me less than the spitting in the face of jesus christ caesar is stabbed by the senators christ is cuffed by lackeys one feels the god through the greater outrage bossuet who towered above the interlocutors from the summit of a heap of paving stones exclaimed rifle in hand oh cydathenaeum oh myrrhinus oh probalinthus oh graces of the aeantides oh who will grant me to pronounce the verses of homer like a greek of laurium or of edapteon iii light and shadow enjolras had been to make a reconnaissance he had made his way out through mondetour lane gliding along close to the houses the insurgents we will remark were full of hope the manner in which they had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to almost disdain in advance the attack at dawn they waited for it with a smile they had no more doubt as to their success than as to their cause moreover succor was evidently on the way to them they reckoned on it with that facility of triumphant
1775,prophecy which is one of the sources of strength in the french combatant they divided the day which was at hand into three distinct phases at six o'clock in the morning a regiment which had been labored with would turn at noon the insurrection of all paris at sunset revolution they heard the alarm bell of saint merry which had not been silent for an instant since the night before a proof that the other barricade the great one jeanne's still held out all these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a sort of gay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike hum of a hive of bees enjolras reappeared he returned from his sombre eagle flight into outer darkness he listened for a moment to all this joy with folded arms and one hand on his mouth then fresh and rosy in the growing whiteness of the dawn he said the whole army of paris is to strike a third of the army is bearing down upon the barricades in which you now are there is the national guard in addition i have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the line and the standard bearers
1776,of the sixth legion in one hour you will be attacked as for the populace it was seething yesterday to day it is not stirring there is nothing to expect nothing to hope for neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment you are abandoned these words fell upon the buzzing of the groups and produced on them the effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm a moment of indescribable silence ensued in which death might have been heard flitting by this moment was brief a voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to enjolras so be it let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet and let us all remain in it citizens let us offer the protests of corpses let us show that if the people abandon the republicans the republicans do not abandon the people these words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of individual anxieties it was hailed with an enthusiastic acclamation no one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus he was some unknown blouse wearer a stranger a man forgotten a passing hero that great
1777,anonymous always mingled in human crises and in social geneses who at a given moment utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word and who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute in a lightning flash the people and god this inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air of the th of june that almost at the very same hour on the barricade saint merry the insurgents were raising that clamor which has become a matter of history and which has been consigned to the documents in the case what matters it whether they come to our assistance or not let us get ourselves killed here to the very last man as the reader sees the two barricades though materially isolated were in communication with each other iv minus five plus one after the man who decreed the protest of corpses had spoken and had given this formula of their common soul there issued from all mouths a strangely satisfied and terrible cry funereal in sense and triumphant in tone long live death let us all remain here why all said enjolras all all enjolras resumed the position is good the barricade is fine thirty men are
1778,enough why sacrifice forty they replied because not one will go away citizens cried enjolras and there was an almost irritated vibration in his voice this republic is not rich enough in men to indulge in useless expenditure of them vain glory is waste if the duty of some is to depart that duty should be fulfilled like any other enjolras the man principle had over his co religionists that sort of omnipotent power which emanates from the absolute still great as was this omnipotence a murmur arose a leader to the very finger tips enjolras seeing that they murmured insisted he resumed haughtily let those who are afraid of not numbering more than thirty say so the murmurs redoubled besides observed a voice in one group it is easy enough to talk about leaving the barricade is hemmed in not on the side of the halles said enjolras the rue mondetour is free and through the rue des precheurs one can reach the marche des innocents and there went on another voice you would be captured you would fall in with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs they will spy a man passing in blouse and
1779,cap whence come you don't you belong to the barricade and they will look at your hands you smell of powder shot enjolras without making any reply touched combeferre's shoulder and the two entered the tap room they emerged thence a moment later enjolras held in his outstretched hands the four uniforms which he had laid aside combeferre followed carrying the shoulder belts and the shakos with this uniform said enjolras you can mingle with the ranks and escape here is enough for four and he flung on the ground deprived of its pavement the four uniforms no wavering took place in his stoical audience combeferre took the word come said he you must have a little pity do you know what the question is here it is a question of women see here are there women or are there not are there children or are there not are there mothers yes or no who rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot of little ones around them let that man of you who has never beheld a nurse's breast raise his hand ah you want to get yourselves killed so do i i who am speaking to
1780,you but i do not want to feel the phantoms of women wreathing their arms around me die if you will but don't make others die suicides like that which is on the brink of accomplishment here are sublime but suicide is narrow and does not admit of extension and as soon as it touches your neighbors suicide is murder think of the little blond heads think of the white locks listen enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of the rue du cygne a lighted casement a candle in a poor window on the fifth floor and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head of an old woman who had the air of having spent the night in watching perhaps she is the mother of some one of you well let that man go and make haste to say to his mother here i am mother let him feel at ease the task here will be performed all the same when one supports one's relatives by one's toil one has not the right to sacrifice one's self that is deserting one's family and those who have daughters what are you thinking of you
1781,get yourselves killed you are dead that is well and tomorrow young girls without bread that is a terrible thing man begs woman sells ah those charming and gracious beings so gracious and so sweet who have bonnets of flowers who fill the house with purity who sing and prattle who are like a living perfume who prove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth that jeanne that lise that mimi those adorable and honest creatures who are your blessings and your pride ah good god they will suffer hunger what do you want me to say to you there is a market for human flesh and it is not with your shadowy hands shuddering around them that you will prevent them from entering it think of the street think of the pavement covered with passers by think of the shops past which women go and come with necks all bare and through the mire these women too were pure once think of your sisters those of you who have them misery prostitution the police saint lazare that is what those beautiful delicate girls those fragile marvels of modesty gentleness and loveliness fresher than
1782,lilacs in the month of may will come to ah you have got yourselves killed you are no longer on hand that is well you have wished to release the people from royalty and you deliver over your daughters to the police friends have a care have mercy women unhappy women we are not in the habit of bestowing much thought on them we trust to the women not having received a man's education we prevent their reading we prevent their thinking we prevent their occupying themselves with politics will you prevent them from going to the dead house this evening and recognizing your bodies let us see those who have families must be tractable and shake hands with us and take themselves off and leave us here alone to attend to this affair i know well that courage is required to leave that it is hard but the harder it is the more meritorious you say i have a gun i am at the barricade so much the worse i shall remain there so much the worse is easily said my friends there is a morrow you will not be here to morrow but your families will and what
1783,sufferings see here is a pretty healthy child with cheeks like an apple who babbles prattles chatters who laughs who smells sweet beneath your kiss and do you know what becomes of him when he is abandoned i have seen one a very small creature no taller than that his father was dead poor people had taken him in out of charity but they had bread only for themselves the child was always hungry it was winter he did not cry you could see him approach the stove in which there was never any fire and whose pipe you know was of mastic and yellow clay his breathing was hoarse his face livid his limbs flaccid his belly prominent he said nothing if you spoke to him he did not answer he is dead he was taken to the necker hospital where i saw him i was house surgeon in that hospital now if there are any fathers among you fathers whose happiness it is to stroll on sundays holding their child's tiny hand in their robust hand let each one of those fathers imagine that this child is his own that poor brat i remember and i seem to
1784,see him now when he lay nude on the dissecting table how his ribs stood out on his skin like the graves beneath the grass in a cemetery a sort of mud was found in his stomach there were ashes in his teeth come let us examine ourselves conscientiously and take counsel with our heart statistics show that the mortality among abandoned children is fifty five per cent i repeat it is a question of women it concerns mothers it concerns young girls it concerns little children who is talking to you of yourselves we know well what you are we know well that you are all brave parbleu we know well that you all have in your souls the joy and the glory of giving your life for the great cause we know well that you feel yourselves elected to die usefully and magnificently and that each one of you clings to his share in the triumph very well but you are not alone in this world there are other beings of whom you must think you must not be egoists all dropped their heads with a gloomy air strange contradictions of the human heart at its most sublime
1785,moments combeferre who spoke thus was not an orphan he recalled the mothers of other men and forgot his own he was about to get himself killed he was an egoist marius fasting fevered having emerged in succession from all hope and having been stranded in grief the most sombre of shipwrecks and saturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end was near had plunged deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor which always precedes the fatal hour voluntarily accepted a physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms of that febrile absorption known to and classified by science and which is to suffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure despair also has its ecstasy marius had reached this point he looked on at everything as from without as we have said things which passed before him seemed far away he made out the whole but did not perceive the details he beheld men going and coming as through a flame he heard voices speaking as at the bottom of an abyss but this moved him there was in this scene a point which pierced and roused even him he had but one idea now to die and he
1786,did not wish to be turned aside from it but he reflected in his gloomy somnambulism that while destroying himself he was not prohibited from saving some one else he raised his voice enjolras and combeferre are right said he no unnecessary sacrifice i join them and you must make haste combeferre has said convincing things to you there are some among you who have families mothers sisters wives children let such leave the ranks no one stirred married men and the supporters of families step out of the ranks repeated marius his authority was great enjolras was certainly the head of the barricade but marius was its savior i order it cried enjolras i entreat you said marius then touched by combeferre's words shaken by enjolras order touched by marius entreaty these heroic men began to denounce each other it is true said one young man to a full grown man you are the father of a family go it is your duty rather retorted the man you have two sisters whom you maintain and an unprecedented controversy broke forth each struggled to determine which should not allow himself to be placed at the door of the tomb make
1787,haste said courfeyrac in another quarter of an hour it will be too late citizens pursued enjolras this is the republic and universal suffrage reigns do you yourselves designate those who are to go they obeyed after the expiration of a few minutes five were unanimously selected and stepped out of the ranks there are five of them exclaimed marius there were only four uniforms well began the five one must stay behind and then a struggle arose as to who should remain and who should find reasons for the others not remaining the generous quarrel began afresh you have a wife who loves you you have your aged mother you have neither father nor mother and what is to become of your three little brothers you are the father of five children you have a right to live you are only seventeen it is too early for you to die these great revolutionary barricades were assembling points for heroism the improbable was simple there these men did not astonish each other be quick repeated courfeyrac men shouted to marius from the groups do you designate who is to remain yes said the five choose we will obey you marius
1788,did not believe that he was capable of another emotion still at this idea that of choosing a man for death his blood rushed back to his heart he would have turned pale had it been possible for him to become any paler he advanced towards the five who smiled upon him and each with his eyes full of that grand flame which one beholds in the depths of history hovering over thermopylae cried to him me me me and marius stupidly counted them there were still five of them then his glance dropped to the four uniforms at that moment a fifth uniform fell as if from heaven upon the other four the fifth man was saved marius raised his eyes and recognized m fauchelevent jean valjean had just entered the barricade he had arrived by way of mondetour lane whither by dint of inquiries made or by instinct or chance thanks to his dress of a national guardsman he had made his way without difficulty the sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the rue mondetour had no occasion to give the alarm for a single national guardsman and he had allowed the latter to entangle himself in the
1789,street saying to himself probably it is a reinforcement in any case it is a prisoner the moment was too grave to admit of the sentinel abandoning his duty and his post of observation at the moment when jean valjean entered the redoubt no one had noticed him all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms jean valjean also had seen and heard and he had silently removed his coat and flung it on the pile with the rest the emotion aroused was indescribable who is this man demanded bossuet he is a man who saves others replied combeferre marius added in a grave voice i know him this guarantee satisfied every one enjolras turned to jean valjean welcome citizen and he added you know that we are about to die jean valjean without replying helped the insurgent whom he was saving to don his uniform v the horizon which one beholds from the summit of a barricade the situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place had as result and culminating point enjolras supreme melancholy enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution he was incomplete however so far as
1790,the absolute can be so he had too much of saint just about him and not enough of anacharsis cloots still his mind in the society of the friends of the a b c had ended by undergoing a certain polarization from combeferre's ideas for some time past he had been gradually emerging from the narrow form of dogma and had allowed himself to incline to the broadening influence of progress and he had come to accept as a definitive and magnificent evolution the transformation of the great french republic into the immense human republic as far as the immediate means were concerned a violent situation being given he wished to be violent on that point he never varied and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which is summed up in the words eighty three enjolras was standing erect on the staircase of paving stones one elbow resting on the stock of his gun he was engaged in thought he quivered as at the passage of prophetic breaths places where death is have these effects of tripods a sort of stifled fire darted from his eyes which were filled with an inward look all at once he threw
1791,back his head his blond locks fell back like those of an angel on the sombre quadriga made of stars they were like the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo and enjolras cried citizens do you picture the future to yourselves the streets of cities inundated with light green branches on the thresholds nations sisters men just old men blessing children the past loving the present thinkers entirely at liberty believers on terms of full equality for religion heaven god the direct priest human conscience become an altar no more hatreds the fraternity of the workshop and the school for sole penalty and recompense fame work for all right for all peace over all no more bloodshed no more wars happy mothers to conquer matter is the first step to realize the ideal is the second reflect on what progress has already accomplished formerly the first human races beheld with terror the hydra pass before their eyes breathing on the waters the dragon which vomited flame the griffin who was the monster of the air and who flew with the wings of an eagle and the talons of a tiger fearful beasts which were above
1792,man man nevertheless spread his snares consecrated by intelligence and finally conquered these monsters we have vanquished the hydra and it is called the locomotive we are on the point of vanquishing the griffin we already grasp it and it is called the balloon on the day when this promethean task shall be accomplished and when man shall have definitely harnessed to his will the triple chimaera of antiquity the hydra the dragon and the griffin he will be the master of water fire and of air and he will be for the rest of animated creation that which the ancient gods formerly were to him courage and onward citizens whither are we going to science made government to the force of things become the sole public force to the natural law having in itself its sanction and its penalty and promulgating itself by evidence to a dawn of truth corresponding to a dawn of day we are advancing to the union of peoples we are advancing to the unity of man no more fictions no more parasites the real governed by the true that is the goal civilization will hold its assizes at the summit of europe and later
1793,on at the centre of continents in a grand parliament of the intelligence something similar has already been seen the amphictyons had two sittings a year one at delphos the seat of the gods the other at thermopylae the place of heroes europe will have her amphictyons the globe will have its amphictyons france bears this sublime future in her breast this is the gestation of the nineteenth century that which greece sketched out is worthy of being finished by france listen to me you feuilly valiant artisan man of the people i revere you yes you clearly behold the future yes you are right you had neither father nor mother feuilly you adopted humanity for your mother and right for your father you are about to die that is to say to triumph here citizens whatever happens to day through our defeat as well as through our victory it is a revolution that we are about to create as conflagrations light up a whole city so revolutions illuminate the whole human race and what is the revolution that we shall cause i have just told you the revolution of the true from a political point of view there is
1794,but a single principle the sovereignty of man over himself this sovereignty of myself over myself is called liberty where two or three of these sovereignties are combined the state begins but in that association there is no abdication each sovereignty concedes a certain quantity of itself for the purpose of forming the common right this quantity is the same for all of us this identity of concession which each makes to all is called equality common right is nothing else than the protection of all beaming on the right of each this protection of all over each is called fraternity the point of intersection of all these assembled sovereignties is called society this intersection being a junction this point is a knot hence what is called the social bond some say social contract which is the same thing the word contract being etymologically formed with the idea of a bond let us come to an understanding about equality for if liberty is the summit equality is the base equality citizens is not wholly a surface vegetation a society of great blades of grass and tiny oaks a proximity of jealousies which render each other null and void legally speaking
1795,it is all aptitudes possessed of the same opportunity politically it is all votes possessed of the same weight religiously it is all consciences possessed of the same right equality has an organ gratuitous and obligatory instruction the right to the alphabet that is where the beginning must be made the primary school imposed on all the secondary school offered to all that is the law from an identical school an identical society will spring yes instruction light light everything comes from light and to it everything returns citizens the nineteenth century is great but the twentieth century will be happy then there will be nothing more like the history of old we shall no longer as to day have to fear a conquest an invasion a usurpation a rivalry of nations arms in hand an interruption of civilization depending on a marriage of kings on a birth in hereditary tyrannies a partition of peoples by a congress a dismemberment because of the failure of a dynasty a combat of two religions meeting face to face like two bucks in the dark on the bridge of the infinite we shall no longer have to fear famine farming out prostitution arising
1796,from distress misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the sword and battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events one might almost say there will be no more events we shall be happy the human race will accomplish its law as the terrestrial globe accomplishes its law harmony will be re established between the soul and the star the soul will gravitate around the truth as the planet around the light friends the present hour in which i am addressing you is a gloomy hour but these are terrible purchases of the future a revolution is a toll oh the human race will be delivered raised up consoled we affirm it on this barrier whence should proceed that cry of love if not from the heights of sacrifice oh my brothers this is the point of junction of those who think and of those who suffer this barricade is not made of paving stones nor of joists nor of bits of iron it is made of two heaps a heap of ideas and a heap of woes here misery meets the ideal the day embraces the night and says to it i am
1797,about to die and thou shalt be born again with me from the embrace of all desolations faith leaps forth sufferings bring hither their agony and ideas their immortality this agony and this immortality are about to join and constitute our death brothers he who dies here dies in the radiance of the future and we are entering a tomb all flooded with the dawn enjolras paused rather than became silent his lips continued to move silently as though he were talking to himself which caused them all to gaze attentively at him in the endeavor to hear more there was no applause but they whispered together for a long time speech being a breath the rustling of intelligences resembles the rustling of leaves vi marius haggard javert laconic let us narrate what was passing in marius thoughts let the reader recall the state of his soul we have just recalled it everything was a vision to him now his judgment was disturbed marius let us insist on this point was under the shadow of the great dark wings which are spread over those in the death agony he felt that he had entered the tomb it seemed to him
1798,that he was already on the other side of the wall and he no longer beheld the faces of the living except with the eyes of one dead how did m fauchelevent come there why was he there what had he come there to do marius did not address all these questions to himself besides since our despair has this peculiarity that it envelops others as well as ourselves it seemed logical to him that all the world should come thither to die only he thought of cosette with a pang at his heart however m fauchelevent did not speak to him did not look at him and had not even the air of hearing him when marius raised his voice to say i know him as far as marius was concerned this attitude of m fauchelevent was comforting and if such a word can be used for such impressions we should say that it pleased him he had always felt the absolute impossibility of addressing that enigmatical man who was in his eyes both equivocal and imposing moreover it had been a long time since he had seen him and this still further augmented the impossibility for marius timid
1799,and reserved nature the five chosen men left the barricade by way of mondetour lane they bore a perfect resemblance to members of the national guard one of them wept as he took his leave before setting out they embraced those who remained when the five men sent back to life had taken their departure enjolras thought of the man who had been condemned to death he entered the tap room javert still bound to the post was engaged in meditation do you want anything enjolras asked him javert replied when are you going to kill me wait we need all our cartridges just at present then give me a drink said javert enjolras himself offered him a glass of water and as javert was pinioned he helped him to drink is that all inquired enjolras i am uncomfortable against this post replied javert you are not tender to have left me to pass the night here bind me as you please but you surely might lay me out on a table like that other man and with a motion of the head he indicated the body of m mabeuf there was as the reader will remember a long broad
1800,table at the end of the room on which they had been running bullets and making cartridges all the cartridges having been made and all the powder used this table was free at enjolras command four insurgents unbound javert from the post while they were loosing him a fifth held a bayonet against his breast leaving his arms tied behind his back they placed about his feet a slender but stout whip cord as is done to men on the point of mounting the scaffold which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches in length and made him walk to the table at the end of the room where they laid him down closely bound about the middle of the body by way of further security and by means of a rope fastened to his neck they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt at escape impossible that sort of bond which is called in prisons a martingale which starting at the neck forks on the stomach and meets the hands after passing between the legs while they were binding javert a man standing on the threshold was surveying him with singular attention the shadow cast
1801,by this man made javert turn his head he raised his eyes and recognized jean valjean he did not even start but dropped his lids proudly and confined himself to the remark it is perfectly simple vii the situation becomes aggravated the daylight was increasing rapidly not a window was opened not a door stood ajar it was the dawn but not the awaking the end of the rue de la chanvrerie opposite the barricade had been evacuated by the troops as we have stated it seemed to be free and presented itself to passers by with a sinister tranquillity the rue saint denis was as dumb as the avenue of sphinxes at thebes not a living being in the cross roads which gleamed white in the light of the sun nothing is so mournful as this light in deserted streets nothing was to be seen but there was something to be heard a mysterious movement was going on at a certain distance it was evident that the critical moment was approaching as on the previous evening the sentinels had come in but this time all had come the barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack
1802,since the departure of the five they had increased its height still further on the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of the halles enjolras for fear of a surprise in the rear came to a serious decision he had the small gut of the mondetour lane which had been left open up to that time barricaded for this purpose they tore up the pavement for the length of several houses more in this manner the barricade walled on three streets in front on the rue de la chanvrerie to the left on the rues du cygne and de la petite truanderie to the right on the rue mondetour was really almost impregnable it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there it had three fronts but no exit a fortress but a rat hole too said courfeyrac with a laugh enjolras had about thirty paving stones torn up in excess said bossuet piled up near the door of the wine shop the silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack must needs come that enjolras had each man resume his post of battle an allowance of brandy was doled out to each
1803,nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault each man selects his place as though at the theatre they jostle and elbow and crowd each other there are some who make stalls of paving stones here is a corner of the wall which is in the way it is removed here is a redan which may afford protection they take shelter behind it left handed men are precious they take the places that are inconvenient to the rest many arrange to fight in a sitting posture they wish to be at ease to kill and to die comfortably in the sad war of june an insurgent who was a formidable marksman and who was firing from the top of a terrace upon a roof had a reclining chair brought there for his use a charge of grape shot found him out there as soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks for action all disorderly movements cease there is no more pulling from one another there are no more coteries no more asides there is no more holding aloof everything in their spirits converges in and changes into a waiting for the assailants
1804,a barricade before the arrival of danger is chaos in danger it is discipline itself peril produces order as soon as enjolras had seized his double barrelled rifle and had placed himself in a sort of embrasure which he had reserved for himself all the rest held their peace a series of faint sharp noises resounded confusedly along the wall of paving stones it was the men cocking their guns moreover their attitudes were prouder more confident than ever the excess of sacrifice strengthens they no longer cherished any hope but they had despair despair the last weapon which sometimes gives victory virgil has said so supreme resources spring from extreme resolutions to embark in death is sometimes the means of escaping a shipwreck and the lid of the coffin becomes a plank of safety as on the preceding evening the attention of all was directed we might almost say leaned upon the end of the street now lighted up and visible they had not long to wait a stir began distinctly in the saint leu quarter but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack a clashing of chains the uneasy jolting of a mass the click
1805,of brass skipping along the pavement a sort of solemn uproar announced that some sinister construction of iron was approaching there arose a tremor in the bosoms of these peaceful old streets pierced and built for the fertile circulation of interests and ideas and which are not made for the horrible rumble of the wheels of war the fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity of the street became ferocious a cannon made its appearance artillery men were pushing the piece it was in firing trim the fore carriage had been detached two upheld the gun carriage four were at the wheels others followed with the caisson they could see the smoke of the burning lint stock fire shouted enjolras the whole barricade fired the report was terrible an avalanche of smoke covered and effaced both cannon and men after a few seconds the cloud dispersed and the cannon and men re appeared the gun crew had just finished rolling it slowly correctly without haste into position facing the barricade not one of them had been struck then the captain of the piece bearing down upon the breech in order to raise the muzzle began to point
1806,the cannon with the gravity of an astronomer levelling a telescope bravo for the cannoneers cried bossuet and the whole barricade clapped their hands a moment later squarely planted in the very middle of the street astride of the gutter the piece was ready for action a formidable pair of jaws yawned on the barricade come merrily now ejaculated courfeyrac that's the brutal part of it after the fillip on the nose the blow from the fist the army is reaching out its big paw to us the barricade is going to be severely shaken up the fusillade tries the cannon takes it is a piece of eight new model brass added combeferre those pieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten parts of tin to one hundred of brass is exceeded the excess of tin renders them too tender then it comes to pass that they have caves and chambers when looked at from the vent hole in order to obviate this danger and to render it possible to force the charge it may become necessary to return to the process of the fourteenth century hooping and to encircle the piece on the outside with
1807,a series of unwelded steel bands from the breech to the trunnions in the meantime they remedy this defect as best they may they manage to discover where the holes are located in the vent of a cannon by means of a searcher but there is a better method with gribeauval's movable star in the sixteenth century remarked bossuet they used to rifle cannon yes replied combeferre that augments the projectile force but diminishes the accuracy of the firing in firing at short range the trajectory is not as rigid as could be desired the parabola is exaggerated the line of the projectile is no longer sufficiently rectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects which is nevertheless a necessity of battle the importance of which increases with the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge this defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the rifled cannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charge small charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic necessities such for instance as the preservation of the gun carriage in short that despot the cannon cannot do all that it desires
1808,force is a great weakness a cannon ball only travels six hundred leagues an hour light travels seventy thousand leagues a second such is the superiority of jesus christ over napoleon reload your guns said enjolras how was the casing of the barricade going to behave under the cannon balls would they effect a breach that was the question while the insurgents were reloading their guns the artillery men were loading the cannon the anxiety in the redoubt was profound the shot sped the report burst forth present shouted a joyous voice and gavroche flung himself into the barricade just as the ball dashed against it he came from the direction of the rue du cygne and he had nimbly climbed over the auxiliary barricade which fronted on the labyrinth of the rue de la petite truanderie gavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than the cannon ball the ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish at the most there was an omnibus wheel broken and the old anceau cart was demolished on seeing this the barricade burst into a laugh go on shouted bossuet to the artillerists viii the artillery men compel people to take them seriously
1809,they flocked round gavroche but he had no time to tell anything marius drew him aside with a shudder what are you doing here hullo said the child what are you doing here yourself and he stared at marius intently with his epic effrontery his eyes grew larger with the proud light within them it was with an accent of severity that marius continued who told you to come back did you deliver my letter at the address gavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of that letter in his haste to return to the barricade he had got rid of it rather than delivered it he was forced to acknowledge to himself that he had confided it rather lightly to that stranger whose face he had not been able to make out it is true that the man was bareheaded but that was not sufficient in short he had been administering to himself little inward remonstrances and he feared marius reproaches in order to extricate himself from the predicament he took the simplest course he lied abominably citizen i delivered the letter to the porter the lady was asleep she will have the letter when she wakes
1810,up marius had had two objects in sending that letter to bid farewell to cosette and to save gavroche he was obliged to content himself with the half of his desire the despatch of his letter and the presence of m fauchelevent in the barricade was a coincidence which occurred to him he pointed out m fauchelevent to gavroche do you know that man no said gavroche gavroche had in fact as we have just mentioned seen jean valjean only at night the troubled and unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves in marius mind were dissipated did he know m fauchelevent's opinions perhaps m fauchelevent was a republican hence his very natural presence in this combat in the meanwhile gavroche was shouting at the other end of the barricade my gun courfeyrac had it returned to him gavroche warned his comrades as he called them that the barricade was blocked he had had great difficulty in reaching it a battalion of the line whose arms were piled in the rue de la petite truanderie was on the watch on the side of the rue du cygne on the opposite side the municipal guard occupied the rue des precheurs the bulk
1811,of the army was facing them in front this information given gavroche added i authorize you to hit em a tremendous whack meanwhile enjolras was straining his ears and watching at his embrasure the assailants dissatisfied no doubt with their shot had not repeated it a company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end of the street behind the piece of ordnance the soldiers were tearing up the pavement and constructing with the stones a small low wall a sort of side work not more than eighteen inches high and facing the barricade in the angle at the left of this epaulement there was visible the head of the column of a battalion from the suburbs massed in the rue saint denis enjolras on the watch thought he distinguished the peculiar sound which is produced when the shells of grape shot are drawn from the caissons and he saw the commander of the piece change the elevation and incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to the left then the cannoneers began to load the piece the chief seized the lint stock himself and lowered it to the vent down with your heads hug the
1812,wall shouted enjolras and all on your knees along the barricade the insurgents who were straggling in front of the wine shop and who had quitted their posts of combat on gavroche's arrival rushed pell mell towards the barricade but before enjolras order could be executed the discharge took place with the terrifying rattle of a round of grape shot this is what it was in fact the charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt and had there rebounded from the wall and this terrible rebound had produced two dead and three wounded if this were continued the barricade was no longer tenable the grape shot made its way in a murmur of consternation arose let us prevent the second discharge said enjolras and lowering his rifle he took aim at the captain of the gun who at that moment was bearing down on the breach of his gun and rectifying and definitely fixing its pointing the captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery very young blond with a very gentle face and the intelligent air peculiar to that predestined and redoubtable weapon which by dint of perfecting itself in horror must end in
1813,killing war combeferre who was standing beside enjolras scrutinized this young man what a pity said combeferre what hideous things these butcheries are come when there are no more kings there will be no more war enjolras you are taking aim at that sergeant you are not looking at him fancy he is a charming young man he is intrepid it is evident that he is thoughtful those young artillery men are very well educated he has a father a mother a family he is probably in love he is not more than five and twenty at the most he might be your brother he is said enjolras yes replied combeferre he is mine too well let us not kill him let me alone it must be done and a tear trickled slowly down enjolras marble cheek at the same moment he pressed the trigger of his rifle the flame leaped forth the artillery man turned round twice his arms extended in front of him his head uplifted as though for breath then he fell with his side on the gun and lay there motionless they could see his back from the centre of which there flowed directly a stream
1814,of blood the ball had traversed his breast from side to side he was dead he had to be carried away and replaced by another several minutes were thus gained in fact ix employment of the old talents of a poacher and that infallible marksmanship which influenced the condemnation of opinions were exchanged in the barricade the firing from the gun was about to begin again against that grape shot they could not hold out a quarter of an hour longer it was absolutely necessary to deaden the blows enjolras issued this command we must place a mattress there we have none said combeferre the wounded are lying on them jean valjean who was seated apart on a stone post at the corner of the tavern with his gun between his knees had up to that moment taken no part in anything that was going on he did not appear to hear the combatants saying around him here is a gun that is doing nothing at the order issued by enjolras he rose it will be remembered that on the arrival of the rabble in the rue de la chanvrerie an old woman foreseeing the bullets had placed her mattress
1815,in front of her window this window an attic window was on the roof of a six story house situated a little beyond the barricade the mattress placed cross wise supported at the bottom on two poles for drying linen was upheld at the top by two ropes which at that distance looked like two threads and which were attached to two nails planted in the window frames these ropes were distinctly visible like hairs against the sky can some one lend me a double barrelled rifle said jean valjean enjolras who had just re loaded his handed it to him jean valjean took aim at the attic window and fired one of the mattress ropes was cut the mattress now hung by one thread only jean valjean fired the second charge the second rope lashed the panes of the attic window the mattress slipped between the two poles and fell into the street the barricade applauded all voices cried here is a mattress yes said combeferre but who will go and fetch it the mattress had in fact fallen outside the barricade between besiegers and besieged now the death of the sergeant of artillery having exasperated the troop the
1816,soldiers had for several minutes been lying flat on their stomachs behind the line of paving stones which they had erected and in order to supply the forced silence of the piece which was quiet while its service was in course of reorganization they had opened fire on the barricade the insurgents did not reply to this musketry in order to spare their ammunition the fusillade broke against the barricade but the street which it filled was terrible jean valjean stepped out of the cut entered the street traversed the storm of bullets walked up to the mattress hoisted it upon his back and returned to the barricade he placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands he fixed it there against the wall in such a manner that the artillery men should not see it that done they awaited the next discharge of grape shot it was not long in coming the cannon vomited forth its package of buck shot with a roar but there was no rebound the effect which they had foreseen had been attained the barricade was saved citizen said enjolras to jean valjean the republic thanks you bossuet admired and laughed he exclaimed
1817,it is immoral that a mattress should have so much power triumph of that which yields over that which strikes with lightning but never mind glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon x dawn at that moment cosette awoke her chamber was narrow neat unobtrusive with a long sash window facing the east on the back court yard of the house cosette knew nothing of what was going on in paris she had not been there on the preceding evening and she had already retired to her chamber when toussaint had said it appears that there is a row cosette had slept only a few hours but soundly she had had sweet dreams which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very white some one who was marius had appeared to her in the light she awoke with the sun in her eyes which at first produced on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream her first thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one cosette felt herself thoroughly reassured like jean valjean she had a few hours previously passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely will not hear
1818,of unhappiness she began to cherish hope with all her might without knowing why then she felt a pang at her heart it was three days since she had seen marius but she said to herself that he must have received her letter that he knew where she was and that he was so clever that he would find means of reaching her and that certainly to day and perhaps that very morning it was broad daylight but the rays of light were very horizontal she thought that it was very early but that she must rise nevertheless in order to receive marius she felt that she could not live without marius and that consequently that was sufficient and that marius would come no objection was valid all this was certain it was monstrous enough already to have suffered for three days marius absent three days this was horrible on the part of the good god now this cruel teasing from on high had been gone through with marius was about to arrive and he would bring good news youth is made thus it quickly dries its eyes it finds sorrow useless and does not accept it youth is the
1819,smile of the future in the presence of an unknown quantity which is itself it is natural to it to be happy it seems as though its respiration were made of hope moreover cosette could not remember what marius had said to her on the subject of this absence which was to last only one day and what explanation of it he had given her every one has noticed with what nimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away and hides and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable there are thoughts which play us the same trick they nestle away in a corner of our brain that is the end of them they are lost it is impossible to lay the memory on them cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little effort made by her memory she told herself that it was very naughty and very wicked of her to have forgotten the words uttered by marius she sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and body her prayers and her toilet one may in a case of exigency introduce the reader into a nuptial chamber not into a virginal
1820,chamber verse would hardly venture it prose must not it is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded it is whiteness in the dark it is the private cell of a closed lily which must not be gazed upon by man so long as the sun has not gazed upon it woman in the bud is sacred that innocent bud which opens that adorable half nudity which is afraid of itself that white foot which takes refuge in a slipper that throat which veils itself before a mirror as though a mirror were an eye that chemise which makes haste to rise up and conceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing vehicle those cords tied those clasps fastened those laces drawn those tremors those shivers of cold and modesty that exquisite affright in every movement that almost winged uneasiness where there is no cause for alarm the successive phases of dressing as charming as the clouds of dawn it is not fitting that all this should be narrated and it is too much to have even called attention to it the eye of man must be more religious in the presence of
1821,the rising of a young girl than in the presence of the rising of a star the possibility of hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect the down on the peach the bloom on the plum the radiated crystal of the snow the wing of the butterfly powdered with feathers are coarse compared to that chastity which does not even know that it is chaste the young girl is only the flash of a dream and is not yet a statue her bed chamber is hidden in the sombre part of the ideal the indiscreet touch of a glance brutalizes this vague penumbra here contemplation is profanation we shall therefore show nothing of that sweet little flutter of cosette's rising an oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by god but that adam looked upon her when she was unfolding and she was ashamed and turned crimson we are of the number who fall speechless in the presence of young girls and flowers since we think them worthy of veneration cosette dressed herself very hastily combed and dressed her hair which was a very simple matter in those days when women did not swell out their curls and
1822,bands with cushions and puffs and did not put crinoline in their locks then she opened the window and cast her eyes around her in every direction hoping to descry some bit of the street an angle of the house an edge of pavement so that she might be able to watch for marius there but no view of the outside was to be had the back court was surrounded by tolerably high walls and the outlook was only on several gardens cosette pronounced these gardens hideous for the first time in her life she found flowers ugly the smallest scrap of the gutter of the street would have met her wishes better she decided to gaze at the sky as though she thought that marius might come from that quarter all at once she burst into tears not that this was fickleness of soul but hopes cut in twain by dejection that was her case she had a confused consciousness of something horrible thoughts were rife in the air in fact she told herself that she was not sure of anything that to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost and the idea that marius could return to
1823,her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming but mournful then as is the nature of these clouds calm returned to her and hope and a sort of unconscious smile which yet indicated trust in god every one in the house was still asleep a country like silence reigned not a shutter had been opened the porter's lodge was closed toussaint had not risen and cosette naturally thought that her father was asleep she must have suffered much and she must have still been suffering greatly for she said to herself that her father had been unkind but she counted on marius the eclipse of such a light was decidedly impossible now and then she heard sharp shocks in the distance and she said it is odd that people should be opening and shutting their carriage gates so early they were the reports of the cannon battering the barricade a few feet below cosette's window in the ancient and perfectly black cornice of the wall there was a martin's nest the curve of this nest formed a little projection beyond the cornice so that from above it was possible to look into this little paradise the mother was there
1824,spreading her wings like a fan over her brood the father fluttered about flew away then came back bearing in his beak food and kisses the dawning day gilded this happy thing the great law multiply lay there smiling and august and that sweet mystery unfolded in the glory of the morning cosette with her hair in the sunlight her soul absorbed in chimeras illuminated by love within and by the dawn without bent over mechanically and almost without daring to avow to herself that she was thinking at the same time of marius began to gaze at these birds at this family at that male and female that mother and her little ones with the profound trouble which a nest produces on a virgin xi the shot which misses nothing and kills no one the assailants fire continued musketry and grape shot alternated but without committing great ravages to tell the truth the top alone of the corinthe facade suffered the window on the first floor and the attic window in the roof riddled with buck shot and biscaiens were slowly losing their shape the combatants who had been posted there had been obliged to withdraw however this is
1825,according to the tactics of barricades to fire for a long while in order to exhaust the insurgents ammunition if they commit the mistake of replying when it is perceived from the slackening of their fire that they have no more powder and ball the assault is made enjolras had not fallen into this trap the barricade did not reply at every discharge by platoons gavroche puffed out his cheek with his tongue a sign of supreme disdain good for you said he rip up the cloth we want some lint courfeyrac called the grape shot to order for the little effect which it produced and said to the cannon you are growing diffuse my good fellow one gets puzzled in battle as at a ball it is probable that this silence on the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers uneasy and to make them fear some unexpected incident and that they felt the necessity of getting a clear view behind that heap of paving stones and of knowing what was going on behind that impassable wall which received blows without retorting the insurgents suddenly perceived a helmet glittering in the sun on a neighboring roof a
1826,fireman had placed his back against a tall chimney and seemed to be acting as sentinel his glance fell directly down into the barricade there's an embarrassing watcher said enjolras jean valjean had returned enjolras rifle but he had his own gun without saying a word he took aim at the fireman and a second later the helmet smashed by a bullet rattled noisily into the street the terrified soldier made haste to disappear a second observer took his place this one was an officer jean valjean who had re loaded his gun took aim at the newcomer and sent the officer's casque to join the soldier's the officer did not persist and retired speedily this time the warning was understood no one made his appearance thereafter on that roof and the idea of spying on the barricade was abandoned why did you not kill the man bossuet asked jean valjean jean valjean made no reply xii disorder a partisan of order bossuet muttered in combeferre's ear he did not answer my question he is a man who does good by gun shots said combeferre those who have preserved some memory of this already distant epoch know that the national
1827,guard from the suburbs was valiant against insurrections it was particularly zealous and intrepid in the days of june a certain good dram shop keeper of pantin des vertus or la cunette whose establishment had been closed by the riots became leonine at the sight of his deserted dance hall and got himself killed to preserve the order represented by a tea garden in that bourgeois and heroic time in the presence of ideas which had their knights interests had their paladins the prosiness of the originators detracted nothing from the bravery of the movement the diminution of a pile of crowns made bankers sing the marseillaise they shed their blood lyrically for the counting house and they defended the shop that immense diminutive of the fatherland with lacedaemonian enthusiasm at bottom we will observe there was nothing in all this that was not extremely serious it was social elements entering into strife while awaiting the day when they should enter into equilibrium another sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmentalism the barbarous name of the correct party people were for order in combination with lack of discipline the drum suddenly beat capricious calls at the command
1828,of such or such a colonel of the national guard such and such a captain went into action through inspiration such and such national guardsmen fought for an idea and on their own account at critical moments on days they took counsel less of their leaders than of their instincts there existed in the army of order veritable guerilleros some of the sword like fannicot others of the pen like henri fonfrede civilization unfortunately represented at this epoch rather by an aggregation of interests than by a group of principles was or thought itself in peril it set up the cry of alarm each constituting himself a centre defended it succored it and protected it with his own head and the first comer took it upon himself to save society zeal sometimes proceeded to extermination a platoon of the national guard would constitute itself on its own authority a private council of war and judge and execute a captured insurgent in five minutes it was an improvisation of this sort that had slain jean prouvaire fierce lynch law with which no one party had any right to reproach the rest for it has been applied by the republic in america
1829,as well as by the monarchy in europe this lynch law was complicated with mistakes on one day of rioting a young poet named paul aime garnier was pursued in the place royale with a bayonet at his loins and only escaped by taking refuge under the porte cochere of no they shouted there's another of those saint simonians and they wanted to kill him now he had under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the duc de saint simon a national guard had read the words saint simon on the book and had shouted death on the th of june a company of the national guards from the suburbs commanded by the captain fannicot above mentioned had itself decimated in the rue de la chanvrerie out of caprice and its own good pleasure this fact singular though it may seem was proved at the judicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection of captain fannicot a bold and impatient bourgeois a sort of condottiere of the order of those whom we have just characterized a fanatical and intractable governmentalist could not resist the temptation to fire prematurely and the ambition of capturing the barricade alone and unaided
1830,that is to say with his company exasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and the old coat which he took for the black flag he loudly blamed the generals and chiefs of the corps who were holding council and did not think that the moment for the decisive assault had arrived and who were allowing the insurrection to fry in its own fat to use the celebrated expression of one of them for his part he thought the barricade ripe and as that which is ripe ought to fall he made the attempt he commanded men as resolute as himself raging fellows as a witness said his company the same which had shot jean prouvaire the poet was the first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street at the moment when they were least expecting it the captain launched his men against the barricade this movement executed with more good will than strategy cost the fannicot company dear before it had traversed two thirds of the street it was received by a general discharge from the barricade four the most audacious who were running on in front were mown down point blank at the
1831,very foot of the redoubt and this courageous throng of national guards very brave men but lacking in military tenacity were forced to fall back after some hesitation leaving fifteen corpses on the pavement this momentary hesitation gave the insurgents time to re load their weapons and a second and very destructive discharge struck the company before it could regain the corner of the street its shelter a moment more and it was caught between two fires and it received the volley from the battery piece which not having received the order had not discontinued its firing the intrepid and imprudent fannicot was one of the dead from this grape shot he was killed by the cannon that is to say by order this attack which was more furious than serious irritated enjolras the fools said he they are getting their own men killed and they are using up our ammunition for nothing enjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which he was insurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons insurrection which is speedily exhausted has only a certain number of shots to fire and a certain number of combatants to expend an empty cartridge box a
1832,man killed cannot be replaced as repression has the army it does not count its men and as it has vincennes it does not count its shots repression has as many regiments as the barricade has men and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge boxes thus they are struggles of one against a hundred which always end in crushing the barricade unless the revolution uprising suddenly flings into the balance its flaming archangel's sword this does happen sometimes then everything rises the pavements begin to seethe popular redoubts abound paris quivers supremely the quid divinum is given forth a th of august is in the air a th of july is in the air a wonderful light appears the yawning maw of force draws back and the army that lion sees before it erect and tranquil that prophet france xiii passing gleams in the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade there is a little of everything there is bravery there is youth honor enthusiasm the ideal conviction the rage of the gambler and above all intermittences of hope one of these intermittences one of these vague quivers of hope suddenly traversed the barricade of the
1833,rue de la chanvrerie at the moment when it was least expected listen suddenly cried enjolras who was still on the watch it seems to me that paris is waking up it is certain that on the morning of the th of june the insurrection broke out afresh for an hour or two to a certain extent the obstinacy of the alarm peal of saint merry reanimated some fancies barricades were begun in the rue du poirier and the rue des gravilliers in front of the porte saint martin a young man armed with a rifle attacked alone a squadron of cavalry in plain sight on the open boulevard he placed one knee on the ground shouldered his weapon fired killed the commander of the squadron and turned away saying there's another who will do us no more harm he was put to the sword in the rue saint denis a woman fired on the national guard from behind a lowered blind the slats of the blind could be seen to tremble at every shot a child fourteen years of age was arrested in the rue de la cossonerie with his pockets full of cartridges many posts were attacked at
1834,the entrance to the rue bertin poiree a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed a regiment of cuirrassiers at whose head marched marshal general cavaignac de barague in the rue planche mibray they threw old pieces of pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs a bad sign and when this matter was reported to marshal soult napoleon's old lieutenant grew thoughtful as he recalled suchet's saying at saragossa we are lost when the old women empty their pots de chambre on our heads these general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment when it was thought that the uprising had been rendered local this fever of wrath these sparks which flew hither and thither above those deep masses of combustibles which are called the faubourgs of paris all this taken together disturbed the military chiefs they made haste to stamp out these beginnings of conflagration they delayed the attack on the barricades maubuee de la chanvrerie and saint merry until these sparks had been extinguished in order that they might have to deal with the barricades only and be able to finish them at one blow columns were thrown into the streets where there was
1835,fermentation sweeping the large sounding the small right and left now slowly and cautiously now at full charge the troops broke in the doors of houses whence shots had been fired at the same time manoeuvres by the cavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards this repression was not effected without some commotion and without that tumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and the people this was what enjolras had caught in the intervals of the cannonade and the musketry moreover he had seen wounded men passing the end of the street in litters and he said to courfeyrac those wounded do not come from us their hope did not last long the gleam was quickly eclipsed in less than half an hour what was in the air vanished it was a flash of lightning unaccompanied by thunder and the insurgents felt that sort of leaden cope which the indifference of the people casts over obstinate and deserted men fall over them once more the general movement which seemed to have assumed a vague outline had miscarried and the attention of the minister of war and the strategy of the generals could now be concentrated on the three
1836,or four barricades which still remained standing the sun was mounting above the horizon an insurgent hailed enjolras we are hungry here are we really going to die like this without anything to eat enjolras who was still leaning on his elbows at his embrasure made an affirmative sign with his head but without taking his eyes from the end of the street xiv wherein will appear the name of enjolras mistress courfeyrac seated on a paving stone beside enjolras continued to insult the cannon and each time that that gloomy cloud of projectiles which is called grape shot passed overhead with its terrible sound he assailed it with a burst of irony you are wearing out your lungs poor brutal old fellow you pain me you are wasting your row that's not thunder it's a cough and the bystanders laughed courfeyrac and bossuet whose brave good humor increased with the peril like madame scarron replaced nourishment with pleasantry and as wine was lacking they poured out gayety to all i admire enjolras said bossuet his impassive temerity astounds me he lives alone which renders him a little sad perhaps enjolras complains of his greatness which binds him to widowhood
1837,the rest of us have mistresses more or less who make us crazy that is to say brave when a man is as much in love as a tiger the least that he can do is to fight like a lion that is one way of taking our revenge for the capers that mesdames our grisettes play on us roland gets himself killed for angelique all our heroism comes from our women a man without a woman is a pistol without a trigger it is the woman that sets the man off well enjolras has no woman he is not in love and yet he manages to be intrepid it is a thing unheard of that a man should be as cold as ice and as bold as fire enjolras did not appear to be listening but had any one been near him that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice patria bossuet was still laughing when courfeyrac exclaimed news and assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement he added my name is eight pounder in fact a new personage had entered on the scene this was a second piece of ordnance the artillery men
1838,rapidly performed their manoeuvres in force and placed this second piece in line with the first this outlined the catastrophe a few minutes later the two pieces rapidly served were firing point blank at the redoubt the platoon firing of the line and of the soldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery another cannonade was audible at some distance at the same time that the two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the rue de la chanvrerie two other cannons trained one from the rue saint denis the other from the rue aubry le boucher were riddling the saint merry barricade the four cannons echoed each other mournfully the barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other one of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on the rue de la chanvrerie was firing grape shot the other balls the piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high and the aim was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper crest of the barricade and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents mingled with bursts of grape shot the object of this mode of firing was to drive
1839,the insurgents from the summit of the redoubt and to compel them to gather close in the interior that is to say this announced the assault the combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls and from the windows of the cabaret by grape shot the attacking columns could venture into the street without being picked off perhaps even without being seen could briskly and suddenly scale the redoubt as on the preceding evening and who knows take it by surprise it is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those guns should be diminished said enjolras and he shouted fire on the artillery men all were ready the barricade which had long been silent poured forth a desperate fire seven or eight discharges followed with a sort of rage and joy the street was filled with blinding smoke and at the end of a few minutes athwart this mist all streaked with flame two thirds of the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of the cannons those who were left standing continued to serve the pieces with severe tranquillity but the fire had slackened things are going well now said bossuet to enjolras success enjolras
1840,shook his head and replied another quarter of an hour of this success and there will not be any cartridges left in the barricade it appears that gavroche overheard this remark xv gavroche outside courfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base of the barricade outside in the street amid the bullets gavroche had taken a bottle basket from the wine shop had made his way out through the cut and was quietly engaged in emptying the full cartridge boxes of the national guardsmen who had been killed on the slope of the redoubt into his basket what are you doing there asked courfeyrac gavroche raised his face i'm filling my basket citizen don't you see the grape shot gavroche replied well it is raining what then courfeyrac shouted come in instanter said gavroche and with a single bound he plunged into the street it will be remembered that fannicot's company had left behind it a trail of bodies twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement through the whole length of the street twenty cartouches for gavroche meant a provision of cartridges for the barricade the smoke in the street was like a fog whoever
1841,has beheld a cloud which has fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments can imagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows of lofty houses it rose gradually and was incessantly renewed hence a twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale the combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other short as it was this obscurity which had probably been desired and calculated on by the commanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade was useful to gavroche beneath the folds of this veil of smoke and thanks to his small size he could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen he rifled the first seven or eight cartridge boxes without much danger he crawled flat on his belly galloped on all fours took his basket in his teeth twisted glided undulated wound from one dead body to another and emptied the cartridge box or cartouche as a monkey opens a nut they did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade which was quite near for fear of attracting attention to him on one body that of a
1842,corporal he found a powder flask for thirst said he putting it in his pocket by dint of advancing he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade became transparent so that the sharpshooters of the line ranged on the outlook behind their paving stone dike and the sharpshooters of the banlieue massed at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to each other something moving through the smoke at the moment when gavroche was relieving a sergeant who was lying near a stone door post of his cartridges a bullet struck the body fichtre ejaculated gavroche they are killing my dead men for me a second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him a third overturned his basket gavroche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue he sprang to his feet stood erect with his hair flying in the wind his hands on his hips his eyes fixed on the national guardsmen who were firing and sang on est laid a nanterre men are ugly at nanterre c'est la faute a voltaire tis the fault of voltaire et bete a palaiseau and dull at palaiseau c'est la faute a rousseau
1843,tis the fault of rousseau then he picked up his basket replaced the cartridges which had fallen from it without missing a single one and advancing towards the fusillade set about plundering another cartridge box there a fourth bullet missed him again gavroche sang je ne suis pas notaire i am not a notary c'est la faute a voltaire tis the fault of voltaire je suis un petit oiseau i'm a little bird c'est la faute a rousseau tis the fault of rousseau a fifth bullet only succeeded in drawing from him a third couplet joie est mon caractere joy is my character c'est la faute a voltaire tis the fault of voltaire misere est mon trousseau misery is my trousseau c'est la faute a rousseau tis the fault of rousseau thus it went on for some time it was a charming and terrible sight gavroche though shot at was teasing the fusillade he had the air of being greatly diverted it was the sparrow pecking at the sportsmen to each discharge he retorted with a couplet they aimed at him constantly and always missed him the national guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him he
1844,lay down sprang to his feet hid in the corner of a doorway then made a bound disappeared re appeared scampered away returned replied to the grape shot with his thumb at his nose and all the while went on pillaging the cartouches emptying the cartridge boxes and filling his basket the insurgents panting with anxiety followed him with their eyes the barricade trembled he sang he was not a child he was not a man he was a strange gamin fairy he might have been called the invulnerable dwarf of the fray the bullets flew after him he was more nimble than they he played a fearful game of hide and seek with death every time that the flat nosed face of the spectre approached the urchin administered to it a fillip one bullet however better aimed or more treacherous than the rest finally struck the will o the wisp of a child gavroche was seen to stagger then he sank to the earth the whole barricade gave vent to a cry but there was something of antaeus in that pygmy for the gamin to touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth
1845,gavroche had fallen only to rise again he remained in a sitting posture a long thread of blood streaked his face he raised both arms in the air glanced in the direction whence the shot had come and began to sing je suis tombe par terre i have fallen to the earth c'est la faute a voltaire tis the fault of voltaire le nez dans le ruisseau with my nose in the gutter c'est la faute a tis the fault of he did not finish a second bullet from the same marksman stopped him short this time he fell face downward on the pavement and moved no more this grand little soul had taken its flight xvi how from a brother one becomes a father at that same moment in the garden of the luxembourg for the gaze of the drama must be everywhere present two children were holding each other by the hand one might have been seven years old the other five the rain having soaked them they were walking along the paths on the sunny side the elder was leading the younger they were pale and ragged they had the air of wild birds the smaller of
1846,them said i am very hungry the elder who was already somewhat of a protector was leading his brother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick they were alone in the garden the garden was deserted the gates had been closed by order of the police on account of the insurrection the troops who had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies of combat how did those children come there perhaps they had escaped from some guard house which stood ajar perhaps there was in the vicinity at the barriere d'enfer or on the esplanade de l'observatoire or in the neighboring carrefour dominated by the pediment on which could be read invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum some mountebank's booth from which they had fled perhaps they had on the preceding evening escaped the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing and had passed the night in some one of those sentry boxes where people read the papers the fact is they were stray lambs and they seemed free to be astray and to seem free is to be lost these poor little creatures were in fact lost these two
1847,children were the same over whom gavroche had been put to some trouble as the reader will recollect children of the thenardiers leased out to magnon attributed to m gillenormand and now leaves fallen from all these rootless branches and swept over the ground by the wind their clothing which had been clean in magnon's day and which had served her as a prospectus with m gillenormand had been converted into rags henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as abandoned children whom the police take note of collect mislay and find again on the pavements of paris it required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these miserable little creatures being in that garden if the superintendents had caught sight of them they would have driven such rags forth poor little things do not enter public gardens still people should reflect that as children they have a right to flowers these children were there thanks to the locked gates they were there contrary to the regulations they had slipped into the garden and there they remained closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors oversight is supposed to continue but it grows slack and reposes and the
1848,inspectors moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the outside than the inside no longer glanced into the garden and had not seen the two delinquents it had rained the night before and even a little in the morning but in june showers do not count for much an hour after a storm it can hardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept the earth in summer is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child at that period of the solstice the light of full noonday is so to speak poignant it takes everything it applies itself to the earth and superposes itself with a sort of suction one would say that the sun was thirsty a shower is but a glass of water a rainstorm is instantly drunk up in the morning everything was dripping in the afternoon everything is powdered over nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and wiped by the rays of sunlight it is warm freshness the gardens and meadows having water at their roots and sun in their flowers become perfuming pans of incense and smoke with all their odors at once everything
1849,smiles sings and offers itself one feels gently intoxicated the springtime is a provisional paradise the sun helps man to have patience there are beings who demand nothing further mortals who having the azure of heaven say it is enough dreamers absorbed in the wonderful dipping into the idolatry of nature indifferent to good and evil contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man who do not understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these and the thirst of those with the nudity of the poor in winter with the lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column with the pallet the attic the dungeon and the rags of shivering young girls when they can dream beneath the trees peaceful and terrible spirits they and pitilessly satisfied strange to say the infinite suffices them that great need of man the finite which admits of embrace they ignore the finite which admits of progress and sublime toil they do not think about the indefinite which is born from the human and divine combination of the infinite and the finite escapes them provided that they are face to face with immensity they smile joy never ecstasy forever their life lies
1850,in surrendering their personality in contemplation the history of humanity is for them only a detailed plan all is not there the true all remains without what is the use of busying oneself over that detail man man suffers that is quite possible but look at aldebaran rising the mother has no more milk the new born babe is dying i know nothing about that but just look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of wood cells of the pine presents under the microscope compare the most beautiful mechlin lace to that if you can these thinkers forget to love the zodiac thrives with them to such a point that it prevents their seeing the weeping child god eclipses their souls this is a family of minds which are at once great and petty horace was one of them so was goethe la fontaine perhaps magnificent egoists of the infinite tranquil spectators of sorrow who do not behold nero if the weather be fair for whom the sun conceals the funeral pile who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in the search for an effect of light who hear neither the cry nor the sob nor
1851,the death rattle nor the alarm peal for whom everything is well since there is a month of may who so long as there are clouds of purple and gold above their heads declare themselves content and who are determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of the birds are exhausted these are dark radiances they have no suspicion that they are to be pitied certainly they are so he who does not weep does not see they are to be admired and pitied as one would both pity and admire a being at once night and day without eyes beneath his lashes but with a star on his brow the indifference of these thinkers is according to some a superior philosophy that may be but in this superiority there is some infirmity one may be immortal and yet limp witness vulcan one may be more than man and less than man there is incomplete immensity in nature who knows whether the sun is not a blind man but then what in whom can we trust solem quis dicere falsum audeat who shall dare to say that the sun is false thus certain geniuses
1852,themselves certain very lofty mortals man stars may be mistaken that which is on high at the summit at the crest at the zenith that which sends down so much light on the earth sees but little sees badly sees not at all is not this a desperate state of things no but what is there then above the sun the god on the th of june about eleven o'clock in the morning the luxembourg solitary and depopulated was charming the quincunxes and flower beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight the branches wild with the brilliant glow of midday seemed endeavoring to embrace in the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets sparrows triumphed woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees administering little pecks on the bark the flower beds accepted the legitimate royalty of the lilies the most august of perfumes is that which emanates from whiteness the peppery odor of the carnations was perceptible the old crows of marie de medici were amorous in the tall trees the sun gilded empurpled set fire to and lighted up the tulips which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers all around the banks
1853,of tulips the bees the sparks of these flame flowers hummed all was grace and gayety even the impending rain this relapse by which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckles were destined to profit had nothing disturbing about it the swallows indulged in the charming threat of flying low he who was there aspired to happiness life smelled good all nature exhaled candor help assistance paternity caress dawn the thoughts which fell from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one kisses it the statues under the trees white and nude had robes of shadow pierced with light these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight rays hung from them on all sides around the great fountain the earth was already dried up to the point of being burnt there was sufficient breeze to raise little insurrections of dust here and there a few yellow leaves left over from the autumn chased each other merrily and seemed to be playing tricks on each other this abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about it life sap heat odors overflowed one was conscious beneath creation of the enormous size of the source in all these
1854,breaths permeated with love in this interchange of reverberations and reflections in this marvellous expenditure of rays in this infinite outpouring of liquid gold one felt the prodigality of the inexhaustible and behind this splendor as behind a curtain of flame one caught a glimpse of god that millionaire of stars thanks to the sand there was not a speck of mud thanks to the rain there was not a grain of ashes the clumps of blossoms had just been bathed every sort of velvet satin gold and varnish which springs from the earth in the form of flowers was irreproachable this magnificence was cleanly the grand silence of happy nature filled the garden a celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts of music the cooing of nests the buzzing of swarms the flutterings of the breeze all the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious whole the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper order the lilacs ended the jasmines began some flowers were tardy some insects in advance of their time the van guard of the red june butterflies fraternized with the rear guard of the white butterflies of may the plantain
1855,trees were getting their new skins the breeze hollowed out undulations in the magnificent enormity of the chestnut trees it was splendid a veteran from the neighboring barracks who was gazing through the fence said here is the spring presenting arms and in full uniform all nature was breakfasting creation was at table this was its hour the great blue cloth was spread in the sky and the great green cloth on earth the sun lighted it all up brilliantly god was serving the universal repast each creature had his pasture or his mess the ring dove found his hemp seed the chaffinch found his millet the goldfinch found chickweed the red breast found worms the green finch found flies the fly found infusoriae the bee found flowers they ate each other somewhat it is true which is the misery of evil mixed with good but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach the two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the grand fountain and rather bewildered by all this light they tried to hide themselves the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence of even impersonal magnificence and they kept
1856,behind the swans hutch here and there at intervals when the wind blew shouts clamor a sort of tumultuous death rattle which was the firing and dull blows which were discharges of cannon struck the ear confusedly smoke hung over the roofs in the direction of the halles a bell which had the air of an appeal was ringing in the distance these children did not appear to notice these noises the little one repeated from time to time i am hungry almost at the same instant with the children another couple approached the great basin they consisted of a goodman about fifty years of age who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six no doubt a father and his son the little man of six had a big brioche at that epoch certain houses abutting on the river in the rues madame and d'enfer had keys to the luxembourg garden of which the lodgers enjoyed the use when the gates were shut a privilege which was suppressed later on this father and son came from one of these houses no doubt the two poor little creatures watched that gentleman approaching and hid themselves a little more
1857,thoroughly he was a bourgeois the same person perhaps whom marius had one day heard through his love fever near the same grand basin counselling his son to avoid excesses he had an affable and haughty air and a mouth which was always smiling since it did not shut this mechanical smile produced by too much jaw and too little skin shows the teeth rather than the soul the child with his brioche which he had bitten into but had not finished eating seemed satiated the child was dressed as a national guardsman owing to the insurrection and the father had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting this bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans he resembled them in this sense that he walked like them for the moment the swans were swimming which is their principal talent and they were superb if the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an age to understand they might have gathered the words of this grave man the father was saying to his son the sage lives content with little
1858,look at me my son i do not love pomp i am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones i leave that false splendor to badly organized souls here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the halles burst out with fresh force of bell and uproar what is that inquired the child the father replied it is the saturnalia all at once he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the green swan hutch there is the beginning said he and after a pause he added anarchy is entering this garden in the meanwhile his son took a bite of his brioche spit it out and suddenly burst out crying what are you crying about demanded his father i am not hungry any more said the child the father's smile became more accentuated one does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake my cake tires me it is stale don't you want any more of it no the father pointed to the swans throw it to those palmipeds the child hesitated a person may not want any more of his cake but that is no reason for giving
1859,it away the father went on be humane you must have compassion on animals and taking the cake from his son he flung it into the basin the cake fell very near the edge the swans were far away in the centre of the basin and busy with some prey they had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche the bourgeois feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted and moved by this useless shipwreck entered upon a telegraphic agitation which finally attracted the attention of the swans they perceived something floating steered for the edge like ships as they are and slowly directed their course toward the brioche with the stupid majesty which befits white creatures the swans cygnes understand signs signes said the bourgeois delighted to make a jest at that moment the distant tumult of the city underwent another sudden increase this time it was sinister there are some gusts of wind which speak more distinctly than others the one which was blowing at that moment brought clearly defined drum beats clamors platoon firing and the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon this coincided with a black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun
1860,the swans had not yet reached the brioche let us return home said the father they are attacking the tuileries he grasped his son's hand again then he continued from the tuileries to the luxembourg there is but the distance which separates royalty from the peerage that is not far shots will soon rain down he glanced at the cloud perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down the sky is joining in the younger branch is condemned let us return home quickly i should like to see the swans eat the brioche said the child the father replied that would be imprudent and he led his little bourgeois away the son regretting the swans turned his head back toward the basin until a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him in the meanwhile the two little waifs had approached the brioche at the same time as the swans it was floating on the water the smaller of them stared at the cake the elder gazed after the retreating bourgeois father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand flight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the
1861,rue madame as soon as they had disappeared from view the elder child hastily flung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin and clinging to it with his left hand and leaning over the water on the verge of falling in he stretched out his right hand with his stick towards the cake the swans perceiving the enemy made haste and in so doing they produced an effect of their breasts which was of service to the little fisher the water flowed back before the swans and one of these gentle concentric undulations softly floated the brioche towards the child's wand just as the swans came up the stick touched the cake the child gave it a brisk rap drew in the brioche frightened away the swans seized the cake and sprang to his feet the cake was wet but they were hungry and thirsty the elder broke the cake into two portions a large one and a small one took the small one for himself gave the large one to his brother and said to him ram that into your muzzle xvii mortuus pater filium moriturum expectat marius dashed out of the barricade combeferre
1862,followed him but he was too late gavroche was dead combeferre brought back the basket of cartridges marius bore the child alas he thought that which the father had done for his father he was requiting to the son only thenardier had brought back his father alive he was bringing back the child dead when marius re entered the redoubt with gavroche in his arms his face like the child was inundated with blood at the moment when he had stooped to lift gavroche a bullet had grazed his head he had not noticed it courfeyrac untied his cravat and with it bandaged marius brow they laid gavroche on the same table with mabeuf and spread over the two corpses the black shawl there was enough of it for both the old man and the child combeferre distributed the cartridges from the basket which he had brought in this gave each man fifteen rounds to fire jean valjean was still in the same place motionless on his stone post when combeferre offered him his fifteen cartridges he shook his head here's a rare eccentric said combeferre in a low voice to enjolras he finds a way of not fighting in
1863,this barricade which does not prevent him from defending it responded enjolras heroism has its originals resumed combeferre and courfeyrac who had overheard added he is another sort from father mabeuf one thing which must be noted is that the fire which was battering the barricade hardly disturbed the interior those who have never traversed the whirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the singular moments of tranquillity mingled with these convulsions men go and come they talk they jest they lounge some one whom we know heard a combatant say to him in the midst of the grape shot we are here as at a bachelor breakfast the redoubt of the rue de la chanvrerie we repeat seemed very calm within all mutations and all phases had been or were about to be exhausted the position from critical had become menacing and from menacing was probably about to become desperate in proportion as the situation grew gloomy the glow of heroism empurpled the barricade more and more enjolras who was grave dominated it in the attitude of a young spartan sacrificing his naked sword to the sombre genius epidotas combeferre wearing an apron was dressing
1864,the wounds bossuet and feuilly were making cartridges with the powder flask picked up by gavroche on the dead corporal and bossuet said to feuilly we are soon to take the diligence for another planet courfeyrac was disposing and arranging on some paving stones which he had reserved for himself near enjolras a complete arsenal his sword cane his gun two holster pistols and a cudgel with the care of a young girl setting a small dunkerque in order jean valjean stared silently at the wall opposite him an artisan was fastening mother hucheloup's big straw hat on his head with a string for fear of sun stroke as he said the young men from the cougourde d'aix were chatting merrily among themselves as though eager to speak patois for the last time joly who had taken widow hucheloup's mirror from the wall was examining his tongue in it some combatants having discovered a few crusts of rather mouldy bread in a drawer were eagerly devouring them marius was disturbed with regard to what his father was about to say to him xviii the vulture become prey we must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades nothing which is
1865,characteristic of that surprising war of the streets should be omitted whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we have just mentioned the barricade for those who are inside it remains none the less a vision there is something of the apocalypse in civil war all the mists of the unknown are commingled with fierce flashes revolutions are sphinxes and any one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed a dream the feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed out in the case of marius and we shall see the consequences they are both more and less than life on emerging from a barricade one no longer knows what one has seen there one has been terrible but one knows it not one has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had human faces one's head has been in the light of the future there were corpses lying prone there and phantoms standing erect the hours were colossal and seemed hours of eternity one has lived in death shadows have passed by what were they one has beheld hands on which there was blood there was a deafening horror there was
1866,also a frightful silence there were open mouths which shouted and other open mouths which held their peace one was in the midst of smoke of night perhaps one fancied that one had touched the sinister ooze of unknown depths one stares at something red on one's finger nails one no longer remembers anything let us return to the rue de la chanvrerie all at once between two discharges the distant sound of a clock striking the hour became audible it is midday said combeferre the twelve strokes had not finished striking when enjolras sprang to his feet and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout carry stones up into the houses line the windowsills and the roofs with them half the men to their guns the other half to the paving stones there is not a minute to be lost a squad of sappers and miners axe on shoulder had just made their appearance in battle array at the end of the street this could only be the head of a column and of what column the attacking column evidently the sappers charged with the demolition of the barricade must always precede the soldiers who are
1867,to scale it they were evidently on the brink of that moment which m clermont tonnerre in called the tug of war enjolras order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar to ships and barricades the only two scenes of combat where escape is impossible in less than a minute two thirds of the stones which enjolras had had piled up at the door of corinthe had been carried up to the first floor and the attic and before a second minute had elapsed these stones artistically set one upon the other walled up the sash window on the first floor and the windows in the roof to half their height a few loop holes carefully planned by feuilly the principal architect allowed of the passage of the gun barrels this armament of the windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing of grape shot had ceased the two cannons were now discharging ball against the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there and if possible a breach for the assault when the stones destined to the final defence were in place enjolras had the bottles which he had set under
1868,the table where mabeuf lay carried to the first floor who is to drink that bossuet asked him they replied enjolras then they barricaded the window below and held in readiness the iron cross bars which served to secure the door of the wine shop at night the fortress was complete the barricade was the rampart the wine shop was the dungeon with the stones which remained they stopped up the outlet as the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing of their ammunition and as the assailants know this the assailants combine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure expose themselves to fire prematurely though in appearance more than in reality and take their ease the preparations for attack are always made with a certain methodical deliberation after which the lightning strikes this deliberation permitted enjolras to take a review of everything and to perfect everything he felt that since such men were to die their death ought to be a masterpiece he said to marius we are the two leaders i will give the last orders inside do you remain outside and observe marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the
1869,barricade enjolras had the door of the kitchen which was the ambulance as the reader will remember nailed up no splashing of the wounded he said he issued his final orders in the tap room in a curt but profoundly tranquil tone feuilly listened and replied in the name of all on the first floor hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase have you them yes said feuilly how many two axes and a pole axe that is good there are now twenty six combatants of us on foot how many guns are there thirty four eight too many keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand swords and pistols in your belts twenty men to the barricade six ambushed in the attic windows and at the window on the first floor to fire on the assailants through the loop holes in the stones let not a single worker remain inactive here presently when the drum beats the assault let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade the first to arrive will have the best places these arrangements made he turned to javert and said i am not forgetting you and laying a pistol
1870,on the table he added the last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy here inquired a voice no let us not mix their corpses with our own the little barricade of the mondetour lane can be scaled it is only four feet high the man is well pinioned he shall be taken thither and put to death there was some one who was more impassive at that moment than enjolras it was javert here jean valjean made his appearance he had been lost among the group of insurgents he stepped forth and said to enjolras you are the commander yes you thanked me a while ago in the name of the republic the barricade has two saviors marius pontmercy and yourself do you think that i deserve a recompense certainly well i request one what is it that i may blow that man's brains out javert raised his head saw jean valjean made an almost imperceptible movement and said that is just as for enjolras he had begun to re load his rifle he cut his eyes about him no objections and he turned to jean valjean take the spy jean valjean did in
1871,fact take possession of javert by seating himself on the end of the table he seized the pistol and a faint click announced that he had cocked it almost at the same moment a blast of trumpets became audible take care shouted marius from the top of the barricade javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar to him and gazing intently at the insurgents he said to them you are in no better case than i am all out shouted enjolras the insurgents poured out tumultuously and as they went received in the back may we be permitted the expression this sally of javert's we shall meet again shortly xix jean valjean takes his revenge when jean valjean was left alone with javert he untied the rope which fastened the prisoner across the middle of the body and the knot of which was under the table after this he made him a sign to rise javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy of enchained authority is condensed jean valjean took javert by the martingale as one would take a beast of burden by the breast band and dragging the latter after him emerged
1872,from the wine shop slowly because javert with his impeded limbs could take only very short steps jean valjean had the pistol in his hand in this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade the insurgents all intent on the attack which was imminent had their backs turned to these two marius alone stationed on one side at the extreme left of the barricade saw them pass this group of victim and executioner was illuminated by the sepulchral light which he bore in his own soul jean valjean with some difficulty but without relaxing his hold for a single instant made javert pinioned as he was scale the little entrenchment in the mondetour lane when they had crossed this barrier they found themselves alone in the lane no one saw them among the heap they could distinguish a livid face streaming hair a pierced hand and the half nude breast of a woman it was eponine the corner of the houses hid them from the insurgents the corpses carried away from the barricade formed a terrible pile a few paces distant javert gazed askance at this body and profoundly calm said in a low tone it strikes me
1873,that i know that girl then he turned to jean valjean jean valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on javert a look which it required no words to interpret javert it is i javert replied take your revenge jean valjean drew from his pocket a knife and opened it a clasp knife exclaimed javert you are right that suits you better jean valjean cut the martingale which javert had about his neck then he cut the cords on his wrists then stooping down he cut the cord on his feet and straightening himself up he said to him you are free javert was not easily astonished still master of himself though he was he could not repress a start he remained open mouthed and motionless jean valjean continued i do not think that i shall escape from this place but if by chance i do i live under the name of fauchelevent in the rue de l'homme arme no javert snarled like a tiger which made him half open one corner of his mouth and he muttered between his teeth have a care go said jean valjean javert began again thou saidst fauchelevent rue de l'homme arme
1874,number javert repeated in a low voice number he buttoned up his coat once more resumed the military stiffness between his shoulders made a half turn folded his arms and supporting his chin on one of his hands he set out in the direction of the halles jean valjean followed him with his eyes a few minutes later javert turned round and shouted to jean valjean you annoy me kill me rather javert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed jean valjean as thou be off with you said jean valjean javert retreated slowly a moment later he turned the corner of the rue des precheurs when javert had disappeared jean valjean fired his pistol in the air then he returned to the barricade and said it is done in the meanwhile this is what had taken place marius more intent on the outside than on the interior had not up to that time taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark background of the tap room when he beheld him in broad daylight striding over the barricade in order to proceed to his death he recognized him something suddenly recurred to his mind he
1875,recalled the inspector of the rue de pontoise and the two pistols which the latter had handed to him and which he marius had used in this very barricade and not only did he recall his face but his name as well this recollection was misty and troubled however like all his ideas it was not an affirmation that he made but a question which he put to himself is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was javert perhaps there was still time to intervene in behalf of that man but in the first place he must know whether this was javert marius called to enjolras who had just stationed himself at the other extremity of the barricade enjolras what what is the name of yonder man what man the police agent do you know his name of course he told us what is it javert marius sprang to his feet at that moment they heard the report of the pistol jean valjean re appeared and cried it is done a gloomy chill traversed marius heart xx the dead are in the right and the living are not in the wrong the death agony
1876,of the barricade was about to begin everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment a thousand mysterious crashes in the air the breath of armed masses set in movement in the streets which were not visible the intermittent gallop of cavalry the heavy shock of artillery on the march the firing by squads and the cannonades crossing each other in the labyrinth of paris the smokes of battle mounting all gilded above the roofs indescribable and vaguely terrible cries lightnings of menace everywhere the tocsin of saint merry which now had the accents of a sob the mildness of the weather the splendor of the sky filled with sun and clouds the beauty of the day and the alarming silence of the houses for since the preceding evening the two rows of houses in the rue de la chanvrerie had become two walls ferocious walls doors closed windows closed shutters closed in those days so different from those in which we live when the hour was come when the people wished to put an end to a situation which had lasted too long with a charter granted or with a legal country when universal wrath was diffused
1877,in the atmosphere when the city consented to the tearing up of the pavements when insurrection made the bourgeoisie smile by whispering its password in its ear then the inhabitant thoroughly penetrated with the revolt so to speak was the auxiliary of the combatant and the house fraternized with the improvised fortress which rested on it when the situation was not ripe when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted when the masses disowned the movement all was over with the combatants the city was changed into a desert around the revolt souls grew chilled refuges were nailed up and the street turned into a defile to help the army to take the barricade a people cannot be forced through surprise to walk more quickly than it chooses woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand a people does not let itself go at random then it abandons the insurrection to itself the insurgents become noxious infected with the plague a house is an escarpment a door is a refusal a facade is a wall this wall hears sees and will not it might open and save you no this wall is a judge it gazes at you and condemns you
1878,what dismal things are closed houses they seem dead they are living life which is as it were suspended there persists there no one has gone out of them for four and twenty hours but no one is missing from them in the interior of that rock people go and come go to bed and rise again they are a family party there there they eat and drink they are afraid a terrible thing fear excuses this fearful lack of hospitality terror is mixed with it an extenuating circumstance sometimes even and this has been actually seen fear turns to passion fright may change into fury as prudence does into rage hence this wise saying the enraged moderates there are outbursts of supreme terror whence springs wrath like a mournful smoke what do these people want what have they come there to do let them get out of the scrape so much the worse for them it is their fault they are only getting what they deserve it does not concern us here is our poor street all riddled with balls they are a pack of rascals above all things don't open the door and the house assumes the air
1879,of a tomb the insurgent is in the death throes in front of that house he sees the grape shot and naked swords drawing near if he cries he knows that they are listening to him and that no one will come there stand walls which might protect him there are men who might save him and these walls have ears of flesh and these men have bowels of stone whom shall he reproach no one and every one the incomplete times in which we live it is always at its own risk and peril that utopia is converted into revolution and from philosophical protest becomes an armed protest and from minerva turns to pallas the utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt knows what awaits it it almost always comes too soon then it becomes resigned and stoically accepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph it serves those who deny it without complaint even excusing them and even disculpates them and its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment it is indomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude is this ingratitude however yes from the point of view of the human race no from the point of view
1880,of the individual progress is man's mode of existence the general life of the human race is called progress the collective stride of the human race is called progress progress advances it makes the great human and terrestrial journey towards the celestial and the divine it has its halting places where it rallies the laggard troop it has its stations where it meditates in the presence of some splendid canaan suddenly unveiled on its horizon it has its nights when it sleeps and it is one of the poignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees the shadow resting on the human soul and that he gropes in darkness without being able to awaken that slumbering progress god is dead perhaps said gerard de nerval one day to the writer of these lines confounding progress with god and taking the interruption of movement for the death of being he who despairs is in the wrong progress infallibly awakes and in short we may say that it marches on even when it is asleep for it has increased in size when we behold it erect once more we find it taller to be always peaceful does not depend on progress any
1881,more than it does on the stream erect no barriers cast in no boulders obstacles make water froth and humanity boil hence arise troubles but after these troubles we recognize the fact that ground has been gained until order which is nothing else than universal peace has been established until harmony and unity reign progress will have revolutions as its halting places what then is progress we have just enunciated it the permanent life of the peoples now it sometimes happens that the momentary life of individuals offers resistance to the eternal life of the human race let us admit without bitterness that the individual has his distinct interests and can without forfeiture stipulate for his interest and defend it the present has its pardonable dose of egotism momentary life has its rights and is not bound to sacrifice itself constantly to the future the generation which is passing in its turn over the earth is not forced to abridge it for the sake of the generations its equal after all who will have their turn later on i exist murmurs that some one whose name is all i am young and in love i am old and i wish
1882,to repose i am the father of a family i toil i prosper i am successful in business i have houses to lease i have money in the government funds i am happy i have a wife and children i have all this i desire to live leave me in peace hence at certain hours a profound cold broods over the magnanimous vanguard of the human race utopia moreover we must admit quits its radiant sphere when it makes war it the truth of to morrow borrows its mode of procedure battle from the lie of yesterday it the future behaves like the past it pure idea becomes a deed of violence it complicates its heroism with a violence for which it is just that it should be held to answer a violence of occasion and expedient contrary to principle and for which it is fatally punished the utopia insurrection fights with the old military code in its fist it shoots spies it executes traitors it suppresses living beings and flings them into unknown darkness it makes use of death a serious matter it seems as though utopia had no longer any faith in radiance its irresistible and incorruptible force
1883,it strikes with the sword now no sword is simple every blade has two edges he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other having made this reservation and made it with all severity it is impossible for us not to admire whether they succeed or not those the glorious combatants of the future the confessors of utopia even when they miscarry they are worthy of veneration and it is perhaps in failure that they possess the most majesty y when it is in accord with progress merits the applause of the people but a heroic defeat merits their tender compassion the one is magnificent the other sublime for our own part we prefer martyrdom to success john brown is greater than washington and pisacane is greater than garibaldi it certainly is necessary that some one should take the part of the vanquished we are unjust towards these great men who attempt the future when they fail revolutionists are accused of sowing fear abroad every barricade seems a crime their theories are incriminated their aim suspected their ulterior motive is feared their conscience denounced they are reproached with raising erecting and heaping up against the reigning social state
1884,a mass of miseries of griefs of iniquities of wrongs of despairs and of tearing from the lowest depths blocks of shadow in order therein to embattle themselves and to combat people shout to them you are tearing up the pavements of hell they might reply that is because our barricade is made of good intentions the best thing assuredly is the pacific solution in short let us agree that when we behold the pavement we think of the bear and it is a good will which renders society uneasy but it depends on society to save itself it is to its own good will that we make our appeal no violent remedy is necessary to study evil amiably to prove its existence then to cure it it is to this that we invite it however that may be even when fallen above all when fallen these men who at every point of the universe with their eyes fixed on france are striving for the grand work with the inflexible logic of the ideal are august they give their life a free offering to progress they accomplish the will of providence they perform a religious act at the appointed hour
1885,with as much disinterestedness as an actor who answers to his cue in obedience to the divine stage manager they enter the tomb and this hopeless combat this stoical disappearance they accept in order to bring about the supreme and universal consequences the magnificent and irresistibly human movement begun on the th of july these soldiers are priests the french revolution is an act of god moreover there are and it is proper to add this distinction to the distinctions already pointed out in another chapter there are accepted revolutions revolutions which are called revolutions there are refused revolutions which are called riots an insurrection which breaks out is an idea which is passing its examination before the people if the people lets fall a black ball the idea is dried fruit the insurrection is a mere skirmish waging war at every summons and every time that utopia desires it is not the thing for the peoples nations have not always and at every hour the temperament of heroes and martyrs they are positive a priori insurrection is repugnant to them in the first place because it often results in a catastrophe in the second place because it always has
1886,an abstraction as its point of departure because and this is a noble thing it is always for the ideal and for the ideal alone that those who sacrifice themselves do thus sacrifice themselves an insurrection is an enthusiasm enthusiasm may wax wroth hence the appeal to arms but every insurrection which aims at a government or a regime aims higher thus for instance and we insist upon it what the chiefs of the insurrection of and in particular the young enthusiasts of the rue de la chanvrerie were combating was not precisely louis philippe the majority of them when talking freely did justice to this king who stood midway between monarchy and revolution no one hated him but they attacked the younger branch of the divine right in louis philippe as they had attacked its elder branch in charles x and that which they wished to overturn in overturning royalty in france was as we have explained the usurpation of man over man and of privilege over right in the entire universe paris without a king has as result the world without despots this is the manner in which they reasoned their aim was distant no doubt vague perhaps
1887,and it retreated in the face of their efforts but it was great thus it is and we sacrifice ourselves for these visions which are almost always illusions for the sacrificed but illusions with which after all the whole of human certainty is mingled we throw ourselves into these tragic affairs and become intoxicated with that which we are about to do who knows we may succeed we are few in number we have a whole army arrayed against us but we are defending right the natural law the sovereignty of each one over himself from which no abdication is possible justice and truth and in case of need we die like the three hundred spartans we do not think of don quixote but of leonidas and we march straight before us and once pledged we do not draw back and we rush onwards with head held low cherishing as our hope an unprecedented victory revolution completed progress set free again the aggrandizement of the human race universal deliverance and in the event of the worst thermopylae these passages of arms for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck and we have just explained why the crowd is restive in
1888,the presence of the impulses of paladins heavy masses the multitudes which are fragile because of their very weight fear adventures and there is a touch of adventure in the ideal moreover and we must not forget this interests which are not very friendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way sometimes the stomach paralyzes the heart the grandeur and beauty of france lies in this that she takes less from the stomach than other nations she more easily knots the rope about her loins she is the first awake the last asleep she marches forwards she is a seeker this arises from the fact that she is an artist the ideal is nothing but the culminating point of logic the same as the beautiful is nothing but the summit of the true artistic peoples are also consistent peoples to love beauty is to see the light that is why the torch of europe that is to say of civilization was first borne by greece who passed it on to italy who handed it on to france divine illuminating nations of scouts vitaelampada tradunt it is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the
1889,element of its progress the amount of civilization is measured by the quantity of imagination only a civilizing people should remain a manly people corinth yes sybaris no whoever becomes effeminate makes himself a bastard he must be neither a dilettante nor a virtuoso but he must be artistic in the matter of civilization he must not refine but he must sublime on this condition one gives to the human race the pattern of the ideal the modern ideal has its type in art and its means is science it is through science that it will realize that august vision of the poets the socially beautiful eden will be reconstructed by a b at the point which civilization has now reached the exact is a necessary element of the splendid and the artistic sentiment is not only served but completed by the scientific organ dreams must be calculated art which is the conqueror should have for support science which is the walker the solidity of the creature which is ridden is of importance the modern spirit is the genius of greece with the genius of india as its vehicle alexander on the elephant races which are petrified in dogma or
1890,demoralized by lucre are unfit to guide civilization genuflection before the idol or before money wastes away the muscles which walk and the will which advances hieratic or mercantile absorption lessens a people's power of radiance lowers its horizon by lowering its level and deprives it of that intelligence at once both human and divine of the universal goal which makes missionaries of nations babylon has no ideal carthage has no ideal athens and rome have and keep throughout all the nocturnal darkness of the centuries halos of civilization france is in the same quality of race as greece and italy she is athenian in the matter of beauty and roman in her greatness moreover she is good she gives herself oftener than is the case with other races is she in the humor for self devotion and sacrifice only this humor seizes upon her and again abandons her and therein lies the great peril for those who run when she desires only to walk or who walk on when she desires to halt france has her relapses into materialism and at certain instants the ideas which obstruct that sublime brain have no longer anything which recalls french greatness and
1891,are of the dimensions of a missouri or a south carolina what is to be done in such a case the giantess plays at being a dwarf immense france has her freaks of pettiness that is all to this there is nothing to say peoples like planets possess the right to an eclipse and all is well provided that the light returns and that the eclipse does not degenerate into night dawn and resurrection are synonymous the reappearance of the light is identical with the persistence of the i let us state these facts calmly death on the barricade or the tomb in exile is an acceptable occasion for devotion the real name of devotion is disinterestedness let the abandoned allow themselves to be abandoned let the exiled allow themselves to be exiled and let us confine ourselves to entreating great nations not to retreat too far when they do retreat one must not push too far in descent under pretext of a return to reason matter exists the minute exists interest exists the stomach exists but the stomach must not be the sole wisdom the life of the moment has its rights we admit but permanent life has its
1892,rights also alas the fact that one is mounted does not preclude a fall this can be seen in history more frequently than is desirable a nation is great it tastes the ideal then it bites the mire and finds it good and if it be asked how it happens that it has abandoned socrates for falstaff it replies because i love statesmen one word more before returning to our subject the conflict a battle like the one which we are engaged in describing is nothing else than a convulsion towards the ideal progress trammelled is sickly and is subject to these tragic epilepsies with that malady of progress civil war we have been obliged to come in contact in our passage this is one of the fatal phases at once act and entr'acte of that drama whose pivot is a social condemnation and whose veritable title is progress progress the cry to which we frequently give utterance is our whole thought and at the point of this drama which we have now reached the idea which it contains having still more than one trial to undergo it is perhaps permitted to us if not to lift the veil from
1893,it to at least allow its light to shine through the book which the reader has under his eye at this moment is from one end to the other as a whole and in detail whatever may be its intermittences exceptions and faults the march from evil to good from the unjust to the just from night to day from appetite to conscience from rottenness to life from hell to heaven from nothingness to god point of departure matter point of arrival the soul the hydra at the beginning the angel at the end xxi the heroes all at once the drum beat the charge the attack was a hurricane on the evening before in the darkness the barricade had been approached silently as by a boa now in broad daylight in that widening street surprise was decidedly impossible rude force had moreover been unmasked the cannon had begun the roar the army hurled itself on the barricade fury now became skill a powerful detachment of infantry of the line broken at regular intervals by the national guard and the municipal guard on foot and supported by serried masses which could be heard though not seen debauched into the street
1894,at a run with drums beating trumpets braying bayonets levelled the sappers at their head and imperturbable under the projectiles charged straight for the barricade with the weight of a brazen beam against a wall the wall held firm the insurgents fired impetuously the barricade once scaled had a mane of lightning flashes the assault was so furious that for one moment it was inundated with assailants but it shook off the soldiers as the lion shakes off the dogs and it was only covered with besiegers as the cliff is covered with foam to re appear a moment later beetling black and formidable the column forced to retreat remained massed in the street unprotected but terrible and replied to the redoubt with a terrible discharge of musketry any one who has seen fireworks will recall the sheaf formed of interlacing lightnings which is called a bouquet let the reader picture to himself this bouquet no longer vertical but horizontal bearing a bullet buck shot or a biscaien at the tip of each one of its jets of flame and picking off dead men one after another from its clusters of lightning the barricade was underneath it on both sides
1895,the resolution was equal the bravery exhibited there was almost barbarous and was complicated with a sort of heroic ferocity which began by the sacrifice of self this was the epoch when a national guardsman fought like a zouave the troop wished to make an end of it insurrection was desirous of fighting the acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth and in the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy in this fray each one underwent the broadening growth of the death hour the street was strewn with corpses the barricade had enjolras at one of its extremities and marius at the other enjolras who carried the whole barricade in his head reserved and sheltered himself three soldiers fell one after the other under his embrasure without having even seen him marius fought unprotected he made himself a target he stood with more than half his body above the breastworks there is no more violent prodigal than the avaricious man who takes the bit in his teeth there is no man more terrible in action than a dreamer marius was formidable and pensive in battle he was as in a dream one would have pronounced him
1896,a phantom engaged in firing a gun the insurgents cartridges were giving out but not their sarcasms in this whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood they laughed courfeyrac was bare headed what have you done with your hat bossuet asked him courfeyrac replied they have finally taken it away from me with cannon balls or they uttered haughty comments can any one understand exclaimed feuilly bitterly those men and he cited names well known names even celebrated names some belonging to the old army who had promised to join us and taken an oath to aid us and who had pledged their honor to it and who are our generals and who abandon us and combeferre restricted himself to replying with a grave smile there are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes the stars from a great distance the interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges that one would have said that there had been a snowstorm the assailants had numbers in their favor the insurgents had position they were at the top of a wall and they thundered point blank upon the soldiers tripping over the dead and wounded and
1897,entangled in the escarpment this barricade constructed as it was and admirably buttressed was really one of those situations where a handful of men hold a legion in check nevertheless the attacking column constantly recruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets drew inexorably nearer and now little by little step by step but surely the army closed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the wine press one assault followed another the horror of the situation kept increasing then there burst forth on that heap of paving stones in that rue de la chanvrerie a battle worthy of a wall of troy these haggard ragged exhausted men who had had nothing to eat for four and twenty hours who had not slept who had but a few more rounds to fire who were fumbling in their pockets which had been emptied of cartridges nearly all of whom were wounded with head or arm bandaged with black and blood stained linen with holes in their clothes from which the blood trickled and who were hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords became titans the barricade was ten times attacked approached assailed scaled and never captured in order to
1898,form an idea of this struggle it is necessary to imagine fire set to a throng of terrible courages and then to gaze at the conflagration it was not a combat it was the interior of a furnace there mouths breathed the flame there countenances were extraordinary the human form seemed impossible there the combatants flamed forth there and it was formidable to behold the going and coming in that red glow of those salamanders of the fray the successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter we renounce all attempts at depicting the epic alone has the right to fill twelve thousand verses with a battle one would have pronounced this that hell of brahmanism the most redoubtable of the seventeen abysses which the veda calls the forest of swords they fought hand to hand foot to foot with pistol shots with blows of the sword with their fists at a distance close at hand from above from below from everywhere from the roofs of the houses from the windows of the wine shop from the cellar windows whither some had crawled they were one against sixty the facade of corinthe half demolished was hideous the window tattooed with

1903,were hemmed in by the lofty six story house which formed the background of their redoubt this house might prove their salvation the building was barricaded and walled as it were from top to bottom before the troops of the line had reached the interior of the redoubt there was time for a door to open and shut the space of a flash of lightning was sufficient for that and the door of that house suddenly opened a crack and closed again instantly was life for these despairing men behind this house there were streets possible flight space they set to knocking at that door with the butts of their guns and with kicks shouting calling entreating wringing their hands no one opened from the little window on the third floor the head of the dead man gazed down upon them but enjolras and marius and the seven or eight rallied about them sprang forward and protected them enjolras had shouted to the soldiers don't advance and as an officer had not obeyed enjolras had killed the officer he was now in the little inner court of the redoubt with his back planted against the corinthe building a sword in

1906,of the rue transnonain when the door was barricaded enjolras said to the others let us sell our lives dearly then he approached the table on which lay mabeuf and gavroche beneath the black cloth two straight and rigid forms were visible one large the other small and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the cold folds of the shroud a hand projected from beneath the winding sheet and hung near the floor it was that of the old man enjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand just as he had kissed his brow on the preceding evening these were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course of his life let us abridge the tale the barricade had fought like a gate of thebes the wine shop fought like a house of saragossa these resistances are dogged no quarter no flag of truce possible men are willing to die provided their opponent will kill them when suchet says capitulate palafox replies after the war with cannon the war with knives nothing was lacking in the capture by assault of the hucheloup wine shop neither paving stones raining from the windows and the roof on

1909,disfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent blinded by blood furious rendered savage made an irruption into the apartment on the first floor there they found only one man still on his feet enjolras without cartridges without sword he had nothing in his hand now but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken over the head of those who were entering he had placed the billiard table between his assailants and himself he had retreated into the corner of the room and there with haughty eye and head borne high with this stump of a weapon in his hand he was still so alarming as to speedily create an empty space around him a cry arose he is the leader it was he who slew the artillery man it is well that he has placed himself there let him remain there let us shoot him down on the spot shoot me said enjolras and flinging away his bit of gun barrel and folding his arms he offered his breast the audacity of a fine death always affects men as soon as enjolras folded his arms and accepted his end the din of strife ceased
1910,in the room and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral solemnity the menacing majesty of enjolras disarmed and motionless appeared to oppress this tumult and this young man haughty bloody and charming who alone had not a wound who was as indifferent as an invulnerable being seemed by the authority of his tranquil glance to constrain this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully his beauty at that moment augmented by his pride was resplendent and he was fresh and rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded it was of him possibly that a witness spoke afterwards before the council of war there was an insurgent whom i heard called apollo a national guardsman who had taken aim at enjolras lowered his gun saying it seems to me that i am about to shoot a flower twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite enjolras and silently made ready their guns then a sergeant shouted take aim an officer intervened wait and addressing enjolras do you wish to have your eyes bandaged no was it you who killed the artillery sergeant
1911,yes grantaire had waked up a few moments before grantaire it will be remembered had been asleep ever since the preceding evening in the upper room of the wine shop seated on a chair and leaning on the table he realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of dead drunk the hideous potion of absinthe porter and alcohol had thrown him into a lethargy his table being small and not suitable for the barricade he had been left in possession of it he was still in the same posture with his breast bent over the table his head lying flat on his arms surrounded by glasses beer jugs and bottles his was the overwhelming slumber of the torpid bear and the satiated leech nothing had had any effect upon it neither the fusillade nor the cannon balls nor the grape shot which had made its way through the window into the room where he was nor the tremendous uproar of the assault he merely replied to the cannonade now and then by a snore he seemed to be waiting there for a bullet which should spare him the trouble of waking many corpses were strewn around him and at
1912,the first glance there was nothing to distinguish him from those profound sleepers of death noise does not rouse a drunken man silence awakens him the fall of everything around him only augmented grantaire's prostration the crumbling of all things was his lullaby the sort of halt which the tumult underwent in the presence of enjolras was a shock to this heavy slumber it had the effect of a carriage going at full speed which suddenly comes to a dead stop the persons dozing within it wake up grantaire rose to his feet with a start stretched out his arms rubbed his eyes stared yawned and understood a fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn away one beholds at a single glance and as a whole all that it has concealed all suddenly presents itself to the memory and the drunkard who has known nothing of what has been taking place during the last twenty four hours has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectly informed ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity the obliteration of intoxication a sort of steam which has obscured the brain is dissipated and makes way for the
1913,clear and sharply outlined importunity of realities relegated as he was to one corner and sheltered behind the billiard table the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on enjolras had not even noticed grantaire and the sergeant was preparing to repeat his order take aim when all at once they heard a strong voice shout beside them long live the republic i'm one of them grantaire had risen the immense gleam of the whole combat which he had missed and in which he had had no part appeared in the brilliant glance of the transfigured drunken man he repeated long live the republic crossed the room with a firm stride and placed himself in front of the guns beside enjolras finish both of us at one blow said he and turning gently to enjolras he said to him do you permit it enjolras pressed his hand with a smile this smile was not ended when the report resounded enjolras pierced by eight bullets remained leaning against the wall as though the balls had nailed him there only his head was bowed grantaire fell at his feet as though struck by a thunderbolt a few moments later the soldiers dislodged the last
1914,remaining insurgents who had taken refuge at the top of the house they fired into the attic through a wooden lattice they fought under the very roof they flung bodies some of them still alive out through the windows two light infantrymen who tried to lift the shattered omnibus were slain by two shots fired from the attic a man in a blouse was flung down from it with a bayonet wound in the abdomen and breathed his last on the ground a soldier and an insurgent slipped together on the sloping slates of the roof and as they would not release each other they fell clasped in a ferocious embrace a similar conflict went on in the cellar shouts shots a fierce trampling then silence the barricade was captured the soldiers began to search the houses round about and to pursue the fugitives xxiv prisoner marius was in fact a prisoner the hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp he had felt at the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness was that of jean valjean jean valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose himself in it had it
1915,not been for him no one in that supreme phase of agony would have thought of the wounded thanks to him everywhere present in the carnage like a providence those who fell were picked up transported to the tap room and cared for in the intervals he reappeared on the barricade but nothing which could resemble a blow an attack or even personal defence proceeded from his hands he held his peace and lent succor moreover he had received only a few scratches the bullets would have none of him if suicide formed part of what he had meditated on coming to this sepulchre to that spot he had not succeeded but we doubt whether he had thought of suicide an irreligious act jean valjean in the thick cloud of the combat did not appear to see marius the truth is that he never took his eyes from the latter when a shot laid marius low jean valjean leaped forward with the agility of a tiger fell upon him as on his prey and bore him off the whirlwind of the attack was at that moment so violently concentrated upon enjolras and upon the door of the wine shop that
1916,no one saw jean valjean sustaining the fainting marius in his arms traverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind the angle of the corinthe building the reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on the street it afforded shelter from the bullets the grape shot and all eyes and a few square feet of space there is sometimes a chamber which does not burn in the midst of a conflagration and in the midst of raging seas beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind alley of shoals a tranquil nook it was in this sort of fold in the interior trapezium of the barricade that eponine had breathed her last there jean valjean halted let marius slide to the ground placed his back against the wall and cast his eyes about him the situation was alarming for an instant for two or three perhaps this bit of wall was a shelter but how was he to escape from this massacre he recalled the anguish which he had suffered in the rue polonceau eight years before and in what manner he had contrived to make his escape it was difficult then
1917,to day it was impossible he had before him that deaf and implacable house six stories in height which appeared to be inhabited only by a dead man leaning out of his window he had on his right the rather low barricade which shut off the rue de la petite truanderie to pass this obstacle seemed easy but beyond the crest of the barrier a line of bayonets was visible the troops of the line were posted on the watch behind that barricade it was evident that to pass the barricade was to go in quest of the fire of the platoon and that any head which should run the risk of lifting itself above the top of that wall of stones would serve as a target for sixty shots on his left he had the field of battle death lurked round the corner of that wall what was to be done only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament and it was necessary to decide on the instant to devise some expedient to come to some decision fighting was going on a few paces away fortunately all were raging around a single point the door of the
1918,wine shop but if it should occur to one soldier to one single soldier to turn the corner of the house or to attack him on the flank all was over jean valjean gazed at the house facing him he gazed at the barricade at one side of him then he looked at the ground with the violence of the last extremity bewildered and as though he would have liked to pierce a hole there with his eyes by dint of staring something vaguely striking in such an agony began to assume form and outline at his feet as though it had been a power of glance which made the thing desired unfold a few paces distant he perceived at the base of the small barrier so pitilessly guarded and watched on the exterior beneath a disordered mass of paving stones which partly concealed it an iron grating placed flat and on a level with the soil this grating made of stout transverse bars was about two feet square the frame of paving stones which supported it had been torn up and it was as it were unfastened through the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture
1919,something like the flue of a chimney or the pipe of a cistern jean valjean darted forward his old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination to thrust aside the stones to raise the grating to lift marius who was as inert as a dead body upon his shoulders to descend with this burden on his loins and with the aid of his elbows and knees into that sort of well fortunately not very deep to let the heavy trap upon which the loosened stones rolled down afresh fall into its place behind him to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below the surface all this was executed like that which one does in dreams with the strength of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle this took only a few minutes jean valjean found himself with marius who was still unconscious in a sort of long subterranean corridor there reigned profound peace absolute silence night the impression which he had formerly experienced when falling from the wall into the convent recurred to him only what he was carrying to day was not cosette it was marius he could barely hear the formidable

1923,a thousand francs from this spring two results the land impoverished and the water tainted hunger arising from the furrow and disease from the stream it is notorious for example that at the present hour the thames is poisoning london so far as paris is concerned it has become indispensable of late to transport the mouths of the sewers down stream below the last bridge a double tubular apparatus provided with valves and sluices sucking up and driving back a system of elementary drainage simple as the lungs of a man and which is already in full working order in many communities in england would suffice to conduct the pure water of the fields into our cities and to send back to the fields the rich water of the cities and this easy exchange the simplest in the world would retain among us the five hundred millions now thrown away people are thinking of other things the process actually in use does evil with the intention of doing good the intention is good the result is melancholy thinking to purge the city the population is blanched like plants raised in cellars a sewer is a mistake when drainage everywhere with

1925,manner that in the blindness of a poor political economy we drown and allow to float down stream and to be lost in the gulfs the well being of all there should be nets at saint cloud for the public fortune economically considered the matter can be summed up thus paris is a spendthrift paris that model city that patron of well arranged capitals of which every nation strives to possess a copy that metropolis of the ideal that august country of the initiative of impulse and of effort that centre and that dwelling of minds that nation city that hive of the future that marvellous combination of babylon and corinth would make a peasant of the fo kian shrug his shoulders from the point of view which we have just indicated imitate paris and you will ruin yourselves moreover and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste paris is itself an imitator these surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel this is no young folly the ancients did like the moderns the sewers of rome says liebig have absorbed all the well being of the roman peasant when the campagna of rome was ruined by the roman sewer rome

1935,backed up babel sometimes the paris sewer took a notion to overflow as though this misunderstood nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage there occurred infamous to relate inundations of the sewer at times that stomach of civilization digested badly the cess pool flowed back into the throat of the city and paris got an after taste of her own filth these resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points they were warnings very badly accepted however the city waxed indignant at the audacity of its mire and did not admit that the filth should return drive it out better the inundation of is one of the actual memories of parisians of the age of eighty the mud spread in cross form over the place des victoires where stands the statue of louis xiv it entered the rue saint honore by the two mouths to the sewer in the champs elysees the rue saint florentin through the saint florentin sewer the rue pierre a poisson through the sewer de la sonnerie the rue popincourt through the sewer of the chemin vert the rue de la roquette through the sewer of the rue de lappe it covered

1937,and which might have served behemoth for a bathtub the great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain well known points we were then very near the epoch when the scavenger's carts from the summit of which sainte foix fraternized with the marquis de crequi discharged their loads directly into the sewer as for cleaning out that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which encumbered rather than swept away rome left some poetry to her sewer and called it the gemoniae paris insulted hers and entitled it the polypus hole science and superstition were in accord in horror the polypus hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend the goblin was developed under the fetid covering of the mouffetard sewer the corpses of the marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la barillerie fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of to the great hiatus of the sewer of the marais which remained yawning until in the rue saint louis almost opposite the sign of the gallant messenger the mouth of the sewer of the rue de la mortellerie was celebrated for the pestilences which had their source there with its grating of iron with
1938,points simulating a row of teeth it was like a dragon's maw in that fatal street breathing forth hell upon men the popular imagination seasoned the sombre parisian sink with some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite the sewer had no bottom the sewer was the lower world the idea of exploring these leprous regions did not even occur to the police to try that unknown thing to cast the plummet into that shadow to set out on a voyage of discovery in that abyss who would have dared it was alarming nevertheless some one did present himself the cess pool had its christopher columbus one day in during one of the rare apparitions which the emperor made in paris the minister of the interior some decres or cretet or other came to the master's intimate levee in the carrousel there was audible the clanking of swords of all those extraordinary soldiers of the great republic and of the great empire then napoleon's door was blocked with heroes men from the rhine from the escaut from the adige and from the nile companions of joubert of desaix of marceau of hoche of kleber the aerostiers of fleurus the grenadiers of

1940,expedition an intelligent workingman who was very young at the time related curious details with regard to it several years ago which bruneseau thought himself obliged to omit in his report to the prefect of police as unworthy of official style the processes of disinfection were at that epoch extremely rudimentary hardly had bruneseau crossed the first articulations of that subterranean network when eight laborers out of the twenty refused to go any further the operation was complicated the visit entailed the necessity of cleaning hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the same time to proceed to note the entrances of water to count the gratings and the vents to lay out in detail the branches to indicate the currents at the point where they parted to define the respective bounds of the divers basins to sound the small sewers grafted on the principal sewer to measure the height under the key stone of each drain and the width at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom in order to determine the arrangements with regard to the level of each water entrance either of the bottom of the arch or on the soil of
1941,the street they advanced with toil the lanterns pined away in the foul atmosphere from time to time a fainting sewerman was carried out at certain points there were precipices the soil had given away the pavement had crumbled the sewer had changed into a bottomless well they found nothing solid a man disappeared suddenly they had great difficulty in getting him out again on the advice of fourcroy they lighted large cages filled with tow steeped in resin from time to time in spots which had been sufficiently disinfected in some places the wall was covered with misshapen fungi one would have said tumors the very stone seemed diseased within this unbreathable atmosphere bruneseau in his exploration proceeded down hill at the point of separation of the two water conduits of the grand hurleur he deciphered upon a projecting stone the date of this stone indicated the limits where philibert delorme charged by henri ii with visiting the subterranean drains of paris had halted this stone was the mark of the sixteenth century on the sewer bruneseau found the handiwork of the seventeenth century once more in the ponceau drain of the old rue vielle du temple vaulted between
1942,and and the handiwork of the eighteenth in the western section of the collecting canal walled and vaulted in these two vaults especially the less ancient that of were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the belt sewer which dated from an epoch when the brook of fresh water of menilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the grand sewer of paris an advancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first valet de chambre to the king something like gros jean transformed into lebel here and there particularly beneath the court house they thought they recognized the hollows of ancient dungeons excavated in the very sewer itself hideous place an iron neck collar was hanging in one of these cells they walled them all up some of their finds were singular among others the skeleton of an ourang outan who had disappeared from the jardin des plantes in a disappearance probably connected with the famous and indisputable apparition of the devil in the rue des bernardins in the last year of the eighteenth century the poor devil had ended by drowning himself in the sewer beneath this long arched drain which terminated at the arche
1943,marion a perfectly preserved rag picker's basket excited the admiration of all connoisseurs everywhere the mire which the sewermen came to handle with intrepidity abounded in precious objects jewels of gold and silver precious stones coins if a giant had filtered this cesspool he would have had the riches of centuries in his lair at the point where the two branches of the rue du temple and of the rue sainte avoye separate they picked up a singular huguenot medal in copper bearing on one side the pig hooded with a cardinal's hat and on the other a wolf with a tiara on his head the most surprising encounter was at the entrance to the grand sewer this entrance had formerly been closed by a grating of which nothing but the hinges remained from one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapeless rag which arrested there in its passage no doubt had floated there in the darkness and finished its process of being torn apart bruneseau held his lantern close to this rag and examined it it was of very fine batiste and in one of the corners less frayed than the rest they made out a heraldic coronet
1944,and embroidered above these seven letters lavbesp the crown was the coronet of a marquis and the seven letters signified laubespine they recognized the fact that what they had before their eyes was a morsel of the shroud of marat marat in his youth had had amorous intrigues this was when he was a member of the household of the comte d'artois in the capacity of physician to the stables from these love affairs historically proved with a great lady he had retained this sheet as a waif or a souvenir at his death as this was the only linen of any fineness which he had in his house they buried him in it some old women had shrouded him for the tomb in that swaddling band in which the tragic friend of the people had enjoyed voluptuousness bruneseau passed on they left that rag where it hung they did not put the finishing touch to it did this arise from scorn or from respect marat deserved both and then destiny was there sufficiently stamped to make them hesitate to touch it besides the things of the sepulchre must be left in the spot which they select in short the
1945,relic was a strange one a marquise had slept in it marat had rotted in it it had traversed the pantheon to end with the rats of the sewer this chamber rag of which watteau would formerly have joyfully sketched every fold had ended in becoming worthy of the fixed gaze of dante the whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of paris lasted seven years from to as he proceeded bruneseau drew directed and completed considerable works in he lowered the arch of the ponceau and everywhere creating new lines he pushed the sewer in under the rue saint denis as far as the fountain of the innocents in under the rue froidmanteau and under the salpetriere in under the rue neuve des petits peres under the rue du mail under the rue de l'echarpe under the place royale in under the rue de la paix and under the chaussee d'antin at the same time he had the whole net work disinfected and rendered healthful in the second year of his work bruneseau engaged the assistance of his son in law nargaud it was thus that at the beginning of the century ancient society cleansed its double bottom
1946,and performed the toilet of its sewer there was that much clean at all events tortuous cracked unpaved full of fissures intersected by gullies jolted by eccentric elbows mounting and descending illogically fetid wild fierce submerged in obscurity with cicatrices on its pavements and scars on its walls terrible such was retrospectively viewed the antique sewer of paris ramifications in every direction crossings of trenches branches goose feet stars as in military mines coecum blind alleys vaults lined with saltpetre pestiferous pools scabby sweats on the walls drops dripping from the ceilings darkness nothing could equal the horror of this old waste crypt the digestive apparatus of babylon a cavern ditch gulf pierced with streets a titanic mole burrow where the mind seems to behold that enormous blind mole the past prowling through the shadows in the filth which has been splendor this we repeat was the sewer of the past v present progress to day the sewer is clean cold straight correct it almost realizes the ideal of what is understood in england by the word respectable it is proper and grayish laid out by rule and line one might almost say as though it came out of a
1947,bandbox it resembles a tradesman who has become a councillor of state one can almost see distinctly there the mire there comports itself with decency at first one might readily mistake it for one of those subterranean corridors which were so common in former days and so useful in flights of monarchs and princes in those good old times when the people loved their kings the present sewer is a beautiful sewer the pure style reigns there the classical rectilinear alexandrine which driven out of poetry appears to have taken refuge in architecture seems mingled with all the stones of that long dark and whitish vault each outlet is an arcade the rue de rivoli serves as pattern even in the sewer however if the geometrical line is in place anywhere it is certainly in the drainage trench of a great city there everything should be subordinated to the shortest road the sewer has nowadays assumed a certain official aspect the very police reports of which it sometimes forms the subject no longer are wanting in respect towards it the words which characterize it in administrative language are sonorous and dignified what used to be called a gut is now
1948,called a gallery what used to be called a hole is now called a surveying orifice villon would no longer meet with his ancient temporary provisional lodging this net work of cellars has its immemorial population of prowlers rodents swarming in greater numbers than ever from time to time an aged and veteran rat risks his head at the window of the sewer and surveys the parisians but even these vermin grow tame so satisfied are they with their subterranean palace the cesspool no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity the rain which in former days soiled the sewer now washes it nevertheless do not trust yourself too much to it miasmas still inhabit it it is more hypocritical than irreproachable the prefecture of police and the commission of health have done their best but in spite of all the processes of disinfection it exhales a vague suspicious odor like tartuffe after confession let us confess that taking it all in all this sweeping is a homage which the sewer pays to civilization and as from this point of view tartuffe's conscience is a progress over the augean stables it is certain that the sewers of paris have been
1949,improved it is more than progress it is transmutation between the ancient and the present sewer there is a revolution what has effected this revolution the man whom all the world forgets and whom we have mentioned bruneseau vi future progress the excavation of the sewer of paris has been no slight task the last ten centuries have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a termination any more than they have been able to finish paris the sewer in fact receives all the counter shocks of the growth of paris within the bosom of the earth it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a thousand antennae which expands below as the city expands above every time that the city cuts a street the sewer stretches out an arm the old monarchy had constructed only twenty three thousand three hundred metres of sewers that was where paris stood in this respect on the first of january beginning with this epoch of which we shall shortly speak the work was usefully and energetically resumed and prosecuted napoleon built the figures are curious four thousand eight hundred and four metres louis xviii five thousand seven hundred and nine
1950,charles x ten thousand eight hundred and thirty six louis philippe eighty nine thousand and twenty the republic of twenty three thousand three hundred and eighty one the present government seventy thousand five hundred in all at the present time two hundred and twenty six thousand six hundred and ten metres sixty leagues of sewers the enormous entrails of paris an obscure ramification ever at work a construction which is immense and ignored as the reader sees the subterranean labyrinth of paris is to day more than ten times what it was at the beginning of the century it is difficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts which have been required to bring this cess pool to the point of relative perfection in which it now is it was with great difficulty that the ancient monarchical provostship and during the last ten years of the eighteenth century the revolutionary mayoralty had succeeded in perforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to all sorts of obstacles hindered this operation some peculiar to the soil others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious population of paris paris is built upon a soil which is
1951,singularly rebellious to the pick the hoe the bore and to human manipulation there is nothing more difficult to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formation upon which is superposed the marvellous historical formation called paris as soon as work in any form whatsoever is begun and adventures upon this stretch of alluvium subterranean resistances abound there are liquid clays springs hard rocks and those soft and deep quagmires which special science calls moutardes the pick advances laboriously through the calcareous layers alternating with very slender threads of clay and schistose beds in plates incrusted with oyster shells the contemporaries of the pre adamite oceans sometimes a rivulet suddenly bursts through a vault that has been begun and inundates the laborers or a layer of marl is laid bare and rolls down with the fury of a cataract breaking the stoutest supporting beams like glass quite recently at villette when it became necessary to pass the collecting sewer under the saint martin canal without interrupting navigation or emptying the canal a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal water suddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel which was beyond the power of the pumping engines it was necessary
1952,to send a diver to explore the fissure which had been made in the narrow entrance of the grand basin and it was not without great difficulty that it was stopped up elsewhere near the seine and even at a considerable distance from the river as for instance at belleville grand rue and lumiere passage quicksands are encountered in which one sticks fast and in which a man sinks visibly add suffocation by miasmas burial by slides and sudden crumbling of the earth add the typhus with which the workmen become slowly impregnated in our own day after having excavated the gallery of clichy with a banquette to receive the principal water conduit of ourcq a piece of work which was executed in a trench ten metres deep after having in the midst of land slides and with the aid of excavations often putrid and of shoring up vaulted the bievre from the boulevard de l'hopital as far as the seine after having in order to deliver paris from the floods of montmartre and in order to provide an outlet for that river like pool nine hectares in extent which crouched near the barriere des martyrs after having let us
1953,state constructed the line of sewers from the barriere blanche to the road of aubervilliers in four months working day and night at a depth of eleven metres after having a thing heretofore unseen made a subterranean sewer in the rue barre du bec without a trench six metres below the surface the superintendent monnot died after having vaulted three thousand metres of sewer in all quarters of the city from the rue traversiere saint antoine to the rue de l'ourcine after having freed the carrefour censier mouffetard from inundations of rain by means of the branch of the arbalete after having built the saint georges sewer on rock and concrete in the fluid sands after having directed the formidable lowering of the flooring of the vault timber in the notre dame de nazareth branch duleau the engineer died there are no bulletins for such acts of bravery as these which are more useful nevertheless than the brutal slaughter of the field of battle the sewers of paris in were far from being what they are to day bruneseau had given the impulse but the cholera was required to bring about the vast reconstruction which took place later on it
1954,is surprising to say for example that in a part of the belt sewer called the grand canal as in venice still stood stagnating uncovered to the sky in the rue des gourdes it was only in that the city of paris found in its pocket the two hundred and sixty thousand eighty francs and six centimes required for covering this mass of filth the three absorbing wells of the combat the cunette and saint mande with their discharging mouths their apparatus their cesspools and their depuratory branches only date from the intestinal sewer of paris has been made over anew and as we have said it has been extended more than tenfold within the last quarter of a century thirty years ago at the epoch of the insurrection of the th and th of june it was still in many localities nearly the same ancient sewer a very great number of streets which are now convex were then sunken causeways at the end of a slope where the tributaries of a street or cross roads ended there were often to be seen large square gratings with heavy bars whose iron polished by the footsteps of the throng gleamed dangerous
1955,and slippery for vehicles and caused horses to fall the official language of the roads and bridges gave to these gratings the expressive name of cassis in in a number of streets in the rue de l'etoile the rue saint louis the rue du temple the rue vielle dutemple the rue notre dame de nazareth the rue folie mericourt the quai aux fleurs the rue du petit muse the rue du normandie the rue pont aux biches the rue des marais the faubourg saint martin the rue notre dame des victoires the faubourg montmartre the rue grange bateliere in the champs elysees the rue jacob the rue de tournon the ancient gothic sewer still cynically displayed its maw it consisted of enormous voids of stone catch basins sometimes surrounded by stone posts with monumental effrontery paris in still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated in five thousand three hundred fathoms after bruneseau on the st of january it had forty thousand three hundred metres between and there had been built on an average seven hundred and fifty metres annually afterwards eight and even ten thousand metres of galleries were constructed every year in masonry of small stones with
1956,hydraulic mortar which hardens under water on a cement foundation at two hundred francs the metre the sixty leagues of paris sewers of the present day represent forty eight millions in addition to the economic progress which we have indicated at the beginning grave problems of public hygiene are connected with that immense question the sewers of paris paris is the centre of two sheets a sheet of water and a sheet of air the sheet of water lying at a tolerably great depth underground but already sounded by two bores is furnished by the layer of green clay situated between the chalk and the jurassic lime stone this layer may be represented by a disk five and twenty leagues in circumference a multitude of rivers and brooks ooze there one drinks the seine the marne the yonne the oise the aisne the cher the vienne and the loire in a glass of water from the well of grenelle the sheet of water is healthy it comes from heaven in the first place and next from the earth the sheet of air is unhealthy it comes from the sewer all the miasms of the cess pool are mingled with the
1957,breath of the city hence this bad breath the air taken from above a dung heap as has been scientifically proved is purer than the air taken from above paris in a given time with the aid of progress mechanisms become perfected and as light increases the sheet of water will be employed to purify the sheet of air that is to say to wash the sewer the reader knows that by washing the sewer we mean the restitution of the filth to the earth the return to the soil of dung and of manure to the fields through this simple act the entire social community will experience a diminution of misery and an augmentation of health at the present hour the radiation of diseases from paris extends to fifty leagues around the louvre taken as the hub of this pestilential wheel we might say that for ten centuries the cess pool has been the disease of paris the sewer is the blemish which paris has in her blood the popular instinct has never been deceived in it the occupation of sewermen was formerly almost as perilous and almost as repugnant to the people as the occupation of knacker which
1958,was so long held in horror and handed over to the executioner high wages were necessary to induce a mason to disappear in that fetid mine the ladder of the cess pool cleaner hesitated to plunge into it it was said in proverbial form to descend into the sewer is to enter the grave and all sorts of hideous legends as we have said covered this colossal sink with terror a dread sink hole which bears the traces of the revolutions of the globe as of the revolutions of man and where are to be found vestiges of all cataclysms from the shells of the deluge to the rag of marat third mud but the soul i the sewer and its surprises it was in the sewers of paris that jean valjean found himself still another resemblance between paris and the sea as in the ocean the diver may disappear there the transition was an unheard of one in the very heart of the city jean valjean had escaped from the city and in the twinkling of an eye in the time required to lift the cover and to replace it he had passed from broad daylight to complete obscurity
1959,from midday to midnight from tumult to silence from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation of the tomb and by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than that of the rue polonceau from the most extreme peril to the most absolute obscurity an abrupt fall into a cavern a disappearance into the secret trap door of paris to quit that street where death was on every side for that sort of sepulchre where there was life was a strange instant he remained for several seconds as though bewildered listening stupefied the waste trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him celestial goodness had in a manner captured him by treachery adorable ambuscades of providence only the wounded man did not stir and jean valjean did not know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a dead corpse his first sensation was one of blindness all of a sudden he could see nothing it seemed to him too that in one instant he had become deaf he no longer heard anything the frantic storm of murder which had been let loose a few feet above his head did not reach him thanks to
1960,the thickness of the earth which separated him from it as we have said otherwise than faintly and indistinctly and like a rumbling in the depths he felt that the ground was solid under his feet that was all but that was enough he extended one arm and then the other touched the walls on both sides and perceived that the passage was narrow he slipped and thus perceived that the pavement was wet he cautiously put forward one foot fearing a hole a sink some gulf he discovered that the paving continued a gust of fetidness informed him of the place in which he stood after the lapse of a few minutes he was no longer blind a little light fell through the man hole through which he had descended and his eyes became accustomed to this cavern he began to distinguish something the passage in which he had burrowed no other word can better express the situation was walled in behind him it was one of those blind alleys which the special jargon terms branches in front of him there was another wall a wall like night the light of the air hole died out ten or twelve
1961,paces from the point where jean valjean stood and barely cast a wan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer beyond the opaqueness was massive to penetrate thither seemed horrible an entrance into it appeared like an engulfment a man could however plunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary so to do haste was even requisite it occurred to jean valjean that the grating which he had caught sight of under the flag stones might also catch the eye of the soldiery and that everything hung upon this chance they also might descend into that well and search it there was not a minute to be lost he had deposited marius on the ground he picked him up again that is the real word for it placed him on his shoulders once more and set out he plunged resolutely into the gloom the truth is that they were less safe than jean valjean fancied perils of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them perchance after the lightning charged whirlwind of the combat the cavern of miasmas and traps after chaos the sewer jean valjean had fallen from one circle of
1962,hell into another when he had advanced fifty paces he was obliged to halt a problem presented itself the passage terminated in another gut which he encountered across his path there two ways presented themselves which should he take ought he to turn to the left or to the right how was he to find his bearings in that black labyrinth this labyrinth to which we have already called the reader's attention has a clue which is its slope to follow to the slope is to arrive at the river this jean valjean instantly comprehended he said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des halles that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope he would arrive in less than a quarter of an hour at some mouth on the seine between the pont au change and the pont neuf that is to say he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot in paris perhaps he would come out on some man hole at the intersection of streets amazement of the passers by at beholding two bleeding men emerge from the earth at their feet
1963,arrival of the police a call to arms of the neighboring post of guards thus they would be seized before they had even got out it would be better to plunge into that labyrinth to confide themselves to that black gloom and to trust to providence for the outcome he ascended the incline and turned to the right when he had turned the angle of the gallery the distant glimmer of an air hole disappeared the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more and he became blind again nevertheless he advanced as rapidly as possible marius two arms were passed round his neck and the former's feet dragged behind him he held both these arms with one hand and groped along the wall with the other marius cheek touched his and clung there bleeding he felt a warm stream which came from marius trickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes but a humid warmth near his ear which the mouth of the wounded man touched indicated respiration and consequently life the passage along which jean valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first jean valjean walked through it with considerable difficulty the
1964,rain of the preceding day had not as yet entirely run off and it created a little torrent in the centre of the bottom and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water thus he proceeded in the gloom he resembled the beings of the night groping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow still little by little whether it was that the distant air holes emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom or whether his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity some vague vision returned to him and he began once more to gain a confused idea now of the wall which he touched now of the vault beneath which he was passing the pupil dilates in the dark and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends by finding god there it was not easy to direct his course the line of the sewer re echoes so to speak the line of the streets which lie above it there were then in paris two thousand two hundred streets let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy branches which is called
1965,the sewer the system of sewers existing at that epoch placed end to end would have given a length of eleven leagues we have said above that the actual net work thanks to the special activity of the last thirty years was no less than sixty leagues in extent jean valjean began by committing a blunder he thought that he was beneath the rue saint denis and it was a pity that it was not so under the rue saint denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from louis xiii and which runs straight to the collecting sewer called the grand sewer with but a single elbow on the right on the elevation of the ancient cour des miracles and a single branch the saint martin sewer whose four arms describe a cross but the gut of the petite truanderie the entrance to which was in the vicinity of the corinthe wine shop has never communicated with the sewer of the rue saint denis it ended at the montmartre sewer and it was in this that jean valjean was entangled there opportunities of losing oneself abound the montmartre sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient
1966,network fortunately jean valjean had left behind him the sewer of the markets whose geometrical plan presents the appearance of a multitude of parrots roosts piled on top of each other but he had before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more than one street corner for they are streets presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogation point first on his left the vast sewer of the platriere a sort of chinese puzzle thrusting out and entangling its chaos of ts and zs under the post office and under the rotunda of the wheat market as far as the seine where it terminates in a y secondly on his right the curving corridor of the rue du cadran with its three teeth which are also blind courts thirdly on his left the branch of the mail complicated almost at its inception with a sort of fork and proceeding from zig zag to zig zag until it ends in the grand crypt of the outlet of the louvre truncated and ramified in every direction and lastly the blind alley of a passage of the rue des jeuneurs without counting little ducts here and there before reaching the belt sewer
1967,which alone could conduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to be safe had jean valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out he would speedily have perceived merely by feeling the wall that he was not in the subterranean gallery of the rue saint denis instead of the ancient stone instead of the antique architecture haughty and royal even in the sewer with pavement and string courses of granite and mortar costing eight hundred livres the fathom he would have felt under his hand contemporary cheapness economical expedients porous stone filled with mortar on a concrete foundation which costs two hundred francs the metre and the bourgeoise masonry known as a petits materiaux small stuff but of all this he knew nothing he advanced with anxiety but with calmness seeing nothing knowing nothing buried in chance that is to say engulfed in providence by degrees we will admit a certain horror seized upon him the gloom which enveloped him penetrated his spirit he walked in an enigma this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable it interlaces in a dizzy fashion it is a melancholy thing to be caught in this paris of shadows jean valjean
1968,was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing it in this unknown every step that he risked might be his last how was he to get out should he find an issue should he find it in time would that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities allow itself to be penetrated and pierced should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness should he arrive at the inextricable and the impassable would marius die there of hemorrhage and he of hunger should they end by both getting lost and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that night he did not know he put all these questions to himself without replying to them the intestines of paris form a precipice like the prophet he was in the belly of the monster all at once he had a surprise at the most unforeseen moment and without having ceased to walk in a straight line he perceived that he was no longer ascending the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels instead of meeting him at his toes the sewer was now descending why was he about to arrive suddenly at the seine
1969,this danger was a great one but the peril of retreating was still greater he continued to advance it was not towards the seine that he was proceeding the ridge which the soil of paris forms on its right bank empties one of its water sheds into the seine and the other into the grand sewer the crest of this ridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very capricious line the culminating point which is the point of separation of the currents is in the sainte avoye sewer beyond the rue michelle comte in the sewer of the louvre near the boulevards and in the montmartre sewer near the halles it was this culminating point that jean valjean had reached he was directing his course towards the belt sewer he was on the right path but he did not know it every time that he encountered a branch he felt of its angles and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the passage in which he was he did not enter but continued his route rightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind alley and could only lead
1970,him further from his goal that is to say the outlet thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in the darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated at a certain moment he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the paris which was petrified by the uprising where the barricades had suppressed circulation and that he was entering beneath the living and normal paris overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder distant but continuous it was the rumbling of vehicles he had been walking for about half an hour at least according to the calculation which he made in his own mind and he had not yet thought of rest he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding marius the darkness was more profound than ever but its very depth reassured him all at once he saw his shadow in front of him it was outlined on a faint almost indistinct reddish glow which vaguely empurpled the flooring vault underfoot and the vault overhead and gilded to his right and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage stupefied he turned round behind him in the
1971,portion of the passage which he had just passed through at a distance which appeared to him immense piercing the dense obscurity flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveying him it was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer in the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in a confused way black upright indistinct horrible ii explanation on the day of the sixth of june a battue of the sewers had been ordered it was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them for refuge and prefect gisquet was to search occult paris while general bugeaud swept public paris a double and connected operation which exacted a double strategy on the part of the public force represented above by the army and below by the police three squads of agents and sewermen explored the subterranean drain of paris the first on the right bank the second on the left bank the third in the city the agents of police were armed with carabines with bludgeons swords and poignards that which was directed at jean valjean at that moment was the lantern of the patrol
1972,of the right bank this patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blind alleys which lie beneath the rue du cadran while they were passing their lantern through the depths of these blind alleys jean valjean had encountered on his path the entrance to the gallery had perceived that it was narrower than the principal passage and had not penetrated thither he had passed on the police on emerging from the gallery du cadran had fancied that they heard the sound of footsteps in the direction of the belt sewer they were in fact the steps of jean valjean the sergeant in command of the patrol had raised his lantern and the squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direction whence the sound proceeded this was an indescribable moment for jean valjean happily if he saw the lantern well the lantern saw him but ill it was light and he was shadow he was very far off and mingled with the darkness of the place he hugged the wall and halted moreover he did not understand what it was that was moving behind him the lack of sleep and food and his emotions had
1973,caused him also to pass into the state of a visionary he beheld a gleam and around that gleam forms what was it he did not comprehend jean valjean having paused the sound ceased the men of the patrol listened and heard nothing they looked and saw nothing they held a consultation there existed at that epoch at this point of the montmartre sewer a sort of cross roads called de service which was afterwards suppressed on account of the little interior lake which formed there swallowing up the torrent of rain in heavy storms the patrol could form a cluster in this open space jean valjean saw these spectres form a sort of circle these bull dogs heads approached each other closely and whispered together the result of this council held by the watch dogs was that they had been mistaken that there had been no noise that it was useless to get entangled in the belt sewer that it would only be a waste of time but that they ought to hasten towards saint merry that if there was anything to do and any bousingot to track out it was in that quarter from time to time parties
1974,re sole their old insults in the word bousingot formed the interim between the word jacobin which had become obsolete and the word demagogue which has since rendered such excellent service the sergeant gave orders to turn to the left towards the watershed of the seine if it had occurred to them to separate into two squads and to go in both directions jean valjean would have been captured all hung on that thread it is probable that the instructions of the prefecture foreseeing a possibility of combat and insurgents in force had forbidden the patrol to part company the patrol resumed its march leaving jean valjean behind it of all this movement jean valjean perceived nothing except the eclipse of the lantern which suddenly wheeled round before taking his departure the sergeant in order to acquit his policeman's conscience discharged his gun in the direction of jean valjean the detonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt like the rumbling of that titanic entrail a bit of plaster which fell into the stream and splashed up the water a few paces away from jean valjean warned him that the ball had struck the arch over his head slow
1975,and measured steps resounded for some time on the timber work gradually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance the group of black forms vanished a glimmer of light oscillated and floated communicating to the vault a reddish glow which grew fainter then disappeared the silence became profound once more the obscurity became complete blindness and deafness resumed possession of the shadows and jean valjean not daring to stir as yet remained for a long time leaning with his back against the wall with straining ears and dilated pupils watching the disappearance of that phantom patrol iii the spun man this justice must be rendered to the police of that period that even in the most serious public junctures it imperturbably fulfilled its duties connected with the sewers and surveillance a revolt was in its eyes no pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths and for neglecting society for the reason that the government was in peril the ordinary service was performed correctly in company with the extraordinary service and was not troubled by the latter in the midst of an incalculable political event already begun under the pressure of a possible revolution
1976,a police agent spun a thief without allowing himself to be distracted by insurrection and barricades it was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoon of the th of june on the banks of the seine on the slope of the right shore a little beyond the pont des invalides there is no longer any bank there now the aspect of the locality has changed on that bank two men separated by a certain distance seemed to be watching each other while mutually avoiding each other the one who was in advance was trying to get away the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other it was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence neither seemed to be in any hurry and both walked slowly as though each of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his pace one would have said that it was an appetite following its prey and purposely without wearing the air of doing so the prey was crafty and on its guard the proper relations between the hunted pole cat and the hunting dog were observed the one who was seeking
1977,to escape had an insignificant mien and not an impressive appearance the one who was seeking to seize him was rude of aspect and must have been rude to encounter the first conscious that he was the more feeble avoided the second but he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious any one who could have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre hostility of flight and all the menace that fear contains the shore was deserted there were no passers by not even a boatman nor a lighter man was in the skiffs which were moored here and there it was not easy to see these two men except from the quay opposite and to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling tattered and equivocal being who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse and the other like a classic and official personage wearing the frock coat of authority buttoned to the chin perchance the reader might recognize these two men if he were to see them closer at hand what was the object of the second man probably
1978,to succeed in clothing the first more warmly when a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags it is in order to make of him a man who is also clothed by the state only the whole question lies in the color to be dressed in blue is glorious to be dressed in red is disagreeable there is a purple from below it is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort which the first man is desirous of shirking if the other allowed him to walk on and had not seized him as yet it was judging from all appearances in the hope of seeing him lead up to some significant meeting place and to some group worth catching this delicate operation is called spinning what renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the buttoned up man on catching sight from the shore of a hackney coach on the quay as it was passing along empty made a sign to the driver the driver understood evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal turned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay at a foot pace this
1979,was not observed by the slouching and tattered personage who was in advance the hackney coach rolled along the trees of the champs elysees the bust of the driver whip in hand could be seen moving along above the parapet one of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their agents contains this article always have on hand a hackney coach in case of emergency while these two men were manoeuvring each on his own side with irreproachable strategy they approached an inclined plane on the quay which descended to the shore and which permitted cab drivers arriving from passy to come to the river and water their horses this inclined plane was suppressed later on for the sake of symmetry horses may die of thirst but the eye is gratified it is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend this inclined plane with a view to making his escape into the champs elysees a place ornamented with trees but in return much infested with policemen and where the other could easily exercise violence this point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought to paris from moret in by colonel
1980,brack and designated as the house of francois i a guard house is situated close at hand to the great surprise of his watcher the man who was being tracked did not mount by the inclined plane for watering he continued to advance along the quay on the shore his position was visibly becoming critical what was he intending to do if not to throw himself into the seine henceforth there existed no means of ascending to the quay there was no other inclined plane no staircase and they were near the spot marked by the bend in the seine towards the pont de jena where the bank growing constantly narrower ended in a slender tongue and was lost in the water there he would inevitably find himself blocked between the perpendicular wall on his right the river on his left and in front of him and the authorities on his heels it is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by a heap of rubbish six or seven feet in height produced by some demolition or other but did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish which one need but
1981,skirt the expedient would have been puerile he certainly was not dreaming of such a thing the innocence of thieves does not extend to that point the pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the water's edge which was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay the man who was being followed arrived at this little mound and went round it so that he ceased to be seen by the other the latter as he did not see could not be seen he took advantage of this fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly in a few moments he had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it there he halted in sheer amazement the man whom he had been pursuing was no longer there total eclipse of the man in the blouse the shore beginning with the rubbish heap was only about thirty paces long then it plunged into the water which beat against the wall of the quay the fugitive could not have thrown himself into the seine without being seen by the man who was following him what had become of him the man in the buttoned
1982,up coat walked to the extremity of the shore and remained there in thought for a moment his fists clenched his eyes searching all at once he smote his brow he had just perceived at the point where the land came to an end and the water began a large iron grating low arched garnished with a heavy lock and with three massive hinges this grating a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay opened on the river as well as on the shore a blackish stream passed under it this stream discharged into the seine beyond the heavy rusty iron bars a sort of dark and vaulted corridor could be descried the man folded his arms and stared at the grating with an air of reproach as this gaze did not suffice he tried to thrust it aside he shook it it resisted solidly it is probable that it had just been opened although no sound had been heard a singular circumstance in so rusty a grating but it is certain that it had been closed again this indicated that the man before whom that door had just opened had not a hook but a key
1983,this evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying to move the grating and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation that is too much a government key then immediately regaining his composure he expressed a whole world of interior ideas by this outburst of monosyllables accented almost ironically come come come come that said and in the hope of something or other either that he should see the man emerge or other men enter he posted himself on the watch behind a heap of rubbish with the patient rage of a pointer the hackney coach which regulated all its movements on his had in its turn halted on the quay above him close to the parapet the coachman foreseeing a prolonged wait encased his horses muzzles in the bag of oats which is damp at the bottom and which is so familiar to parisians to whom be it said in parenthesis the government sometimes applies it the rare passers by on the pont de jena turned their heads before they pursued their way to take a momentary glance at these two motionless items in the landscape the man on the shore the carriage on the quay
1984,iv he also bears his cross jean valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused this march became more and more laborious the level of these vaults varies the average height is about five feet six inches and has been calculated for the stature of a man jean valjean was forced to bend over in order not to strike marius against the vault at every step he had to bend then to rise and to feel incessantly of the wall the moisture of the stones and the viscous nature of the timber framework furnished but poor supports to which to cling either for hand or foot he stumbled along in the hideous dung heap of the city the intermittent gleams from the air holes only appeared at very long intervals and were so wan that the full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon all the rest was mist miasma opaqueness blackness jean valjean was both hungry and thirsty especially thirsty and this like the sea was a place full of water where a man cannot drink his strength which was prodigious as the reader knows and which had been but little decreased by age thanks to
1985,his chaste and sober life began to give way nevertheless fatigue began to gain on him and as his strength decreased it made the weight of his burden increase marius who was perhaps dead weighed him down as inert bodies weigh jean valjean held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed and so that respiration could proceed as well as possible between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rats one of them was frightened to such a degree that he bit him from time to time a breath of fresh air reached him through the vent holes of the mouths of the sewer and re animated him it might have been three hours past midday when he reached the belt sewer he was at first astonished at this sudden widening he found himself all at once in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach the two walls and beneath a vault which his head did not touch the grand sewer is in fact eight feet wide and seven feet high at the point where the montmartre sewer joins the grand sewer two other subterranean galleries that of the rue de provence
1986,and that of the abattoir form a square between these four ways a less sagacious man would have remained undecided jean valjean selected the broadest that is to say the belt sewer but here the question again came up should he descend or ascend he thought that the situation required haste and that he must now gain the seine at any risk in other terms he must descend he turned to the left it was well that he did so for it is an error to suppose that the belt sewer has two outlets the one in the direction of bercy the other towards passy and that it is as its name indicates the subterranean girdle of the paris on the right bank the grand sewer which is it must be remembered nothing else than the old brook of menilmontant terminates if one ascends it in a blind sack that is to say at its ancient point of departure which was its source at the foot of the knoll of menilmontant there is no direct communication with the branch which collects the waters of paris beginning with the quartier popincourt and which falls into the seine through the amelot sewer
1987,above the ancient isle louviers this branch which completes the collecting sewer is separated from it under the rue menilmontant itself by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters between upstream and downstream if jean valjean had ascended the gallery he would have arrived after a thousand efforts and broken down with fatigue and in an expiring condition in the gloom at a wall he would have been lost in case of necessity by retracing his steps a little way and entering the passage of the filles du calvaire on condition that he did not hesitate at the subterranean crossing of the carrefour boucherat and by taking the corridor saint louis then the saint gilles gut on the left then turning to the right and avoiding the saint sebastian gallery he might have reached the amelot sewer and thence provided that he did not go astray in the sort of f which lies under the bastille he might have attained the outlet on the seine near the arsenal but in order to do this he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its openings now
1988,we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful drain which he was traversing and had any one asked him in what he was he would have answered in the night his instinct served him well to descend was in fact possible safety he left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the form of a claw under the rue laffitte and the rue saint georges and the long bifurcated corridor of the chaussee d'antin a little beyond an affluent which was probably the madeleine branch he halted he was extremely weary a passably large air hole probably the man hole in the rue d'anjou furnished a light that was almost vivid jean valjean with the gentleness of movement which a brother would exercise towards his wounded brother deposited marius on the banquette of the sewer marius blood stained face appeared under the wan light of the air hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb his eyes were closed his hair was plastered down on his temples like a painter's brushes dried in red wash his hands hung limp and dead a clot of blood had collected in the knot of
1989,his cravat his limbs were cold and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth his shirt had thrust itself into his wounds the cloth of his coat was chafing the yawning gashes in the living flesh jean valjean pushing aside the garments with the tips of his fingers laid his hand upon marius breast his heart was still beating jean valjean tore up his shirt bandaged the young man's wounds as well as he was able and stopped the flowing blood then bending over marius who still lay unconscious and almost without breathing in that half light he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred on disarranging marius garments he had found two things in his pockets the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding evening and marius pocketbook he ate the roll and opened the pocketbook on the first page he found the four lines written by marius the reader will recall them my name is marius pontmercy carry my body to my grandfather m gillenormand rue des filles du calvaire no in the marais jean valjean read these four lines by the light of the air hole and remained for a moment as though absorbed
1990,in thought repeating in a low tone rue des filles du calvaire number monsieur gillenormand he replaced the pocketbook in marius pocket he had eaten his strength had returned to him he took marius up once more upon his back placed the latter's head carefully on his right shoulder and resumed his descent of the sewer the grand sewer directed according to the course of the valley of menilmontant is about two leagues long it is paved throughout a notable portion of its extent this torch of the names of the streets of paris with which we are illuminating for the reader jean valjean's subterranean march jean valjean himself did not possess nothing told him what zone of the city he was traversing nor what way he had made only the growing pallor of the pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to him that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement and that the day would soon be over and the rolling of vehicles overhead having become intermittent instead of continuous then having almost ceased he concluded that he was no longer under central paris and that he was approaching some solitary region in the
1991,vicinity of the outer boulevards or the extreme outer quays where there are fewer houses and streets the sewer has fewer air holes the gloom deepened around jean valjean nevertheless he continued to advance groping his way in the dark suddenly this darkness became terrible v in the case of sand as in that of woman there is a fineness which is treacherous he felt that he was entering the water and that he no longer had a pavement under his feet but only mud it sometimes happens that on certain shores of bretagne or scotland a man either a traveller or a fisherman while walking at low tide on the beach far from shore suddenly notices that for several minutes past he has been walking with some difficulty the beach under foot is like pitch his soles stick fast to it it is no longer sand it is bird lime the strand is perfectly dry but at every step that he takes as soon as the foot is raised the print is filled with water the eye however has perceived no change the immense beach is smooth and tranquil all the sand has the same aspect nothing distinguishes the
1992,soil that is solid from that which is not solid the joyous little cloud of sand lice continues to leap tumultuously under the feet of the passer by the man pursues his way he walks on turns towards the land endeavors to approach the shore he is not uneasy uneasy about what only he is conscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at every step that he takes all at once he sinks in he sinks in two or three inches decidedly he is not on the right road he halts to get his bearings suddenly he glances at his feet his feet have disappeared the sand has covered them he draws his feet out of the sand he tries to retrace his steps he turns back he sinks in more deeply than before the sand is up to his ankles he tears himself free from it and flings himself to the left the sand reaches to mid leg he flings himself to the right the sand comes up to his knees then with indescribable terror he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a quicksand and that he has beneath him that frightful medium
1993,in which neither man can walk nor fish can swim he flings away his burden if he have one he lightens himself like a ship in distress it is too late the sand is above his knees he shouts he waves his hat or his handkerchief the sand continually gains on him if the beach is deserted if the land is too far away if the bank of sand is too ill famed there is no hero in the neighborhood all is over he is condemned to be engulfed he is condemned to that terrible interment long infallible implacable which it is impossible to either retard or hasten which lasts for hours which will not come to an end which seizes you erect free in the flush of health which drags you down by the feet which at every effort that you attempt at every shout that you utter draws you a little lower which has the air of punishing you for your resistance by a redoubled grasp which forces a man to return slowly to earth while leaving him time to survey the horizon the trees the verdant country the smoke of the villages on the plain the sails
1994,of the ships on the sea the birds which fly and sing the sun and the sky this engulfment is the sepulchre which assumes a tide and which mounts from the depths of the earth towards a living man each minute is an inexorable layer out of the dead the wretched man tries to sit down to lie down to climb every movement that he makes buries him deeper he straightens himself up he sinks he feels that he is being swallowed up he shrieks implores cries to the clouds wrings his hands grows desperate behold him in the sand up to his belly the sand reaches to his breast he is only a bust now he uplifts his hands utters furious groans clenches his nails on the beach tries to cling fast to that ashes supports himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from that soft sheath and sobs frantically the sand mounts higher the sand has reached his shoulders the sand reaches to his throat only his face is visible now his mouth cries aloud the sand fills it silence his eyes still gaze forth the sand closes them night then his brow decreases a little
1995,hair quivers above the sand a hand projects pierces the surface of the beach waves and disappears sinister obliteration of a man sometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse sometimes the carter is swallowed up with his cart all founders in that strand it is shipwreck elsewhere than in the water it is the earth drowning a man the earth permeated with the ocean becomes a pitfall it presents itself in the guise of a plain and it yawns like a wave the abyss is subject to these treacheries this melancholy fate always possible on certain sea beaches was also possible thirty years ago in the sewers of paris before the important works undertaken in the subterranean drain of paris was subject to these sudden slides the water filtered into certain subjacent strata which were particularly friable the foot way which was of flag stones as in the ancient sewers or of cement on concrete as in the new galleries having no longer an underpinning gave way a fold in a flooring of this sort means a crack means crumbling the framework crumbled away for a certain length this crevice the hiatus of a gulf of mire was called
1996,a fontis in the special tongue what is a fontis it is the quicksands of the seashore suddenly encountered under the surface of the earth it is the beach of mont saint michel in a sewer the soaked soil is in a state of fusion as it were all its molecules are in suspension in soft medium it is not earth and it is not water the depth is sometimes very great nothing can be more formidable than such an encounter if the water predominates death is prompt the man is swallowed up if earth predominates death is slow can any one picture to himself such a death if being swallowed by the earth is terrible on the seashore what is it in a cess pool instead of the open air the broad daylight the clear horizon those vast sounds those free clouds whence rains life instead of those barks descried in the distance of that hope under all sorts of forms of probable passers by of succor possible up to the very last moment instead of all this deafness blindness a black vault the inside of a tomb already prepared death in the mire beneath a cover slow suffocation
1997,by filth a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire and clutches you by the throat fetidness mingled with the death rattle slime instead of the strand sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the hurricane dung in place of the ocean and to shout to gnash one's teeth and to writhe and to struggle and to agonize with that enormous city which knows nothing of it all over one's head inexpressible is the horror of dying thus death sometimes redeems his atrocity by a certain terrible dignity on the funeral pile in shipwreck one can be great in the flames as in the foam a superb attitude is possible one there becomes transfigured as one perishes but not here death is filthy it is humiliating to expire the supreme floating visions are abject mud is synonymous with shame it is petty ugly infamous to die in a butt of malvoisie like clarence is permissible in the ditch of a scavenger like escoubleau is horrible to struggle therein is hideous at the same time that one is going through the death agony one is floundering about there are shadows enough for hell and mire enough to render it nothing
1998,but a slough and the dying man knows not whether he is on the point of becoming a spectre or a frog everywhere else the sepulchre is sinister here it is deformed the depth of the fontis varied as well as their length and their density according to the more or less bad quality of the sub soil sometimes a fontis was three or four feet deep sometimes eight or ten sometimes the bottom was unfathomable here the mire was almost solid there almost liquid in the luniere fontis it would have taken a man a day to disappear while he would have been devoured in five minutes by the philippeaux slough the mire bears up more or less according to its density a child can escape where a man will perish the first law of safety is to get rid of every sort of load every sewerman who felt the ground giving way beneath him began by flinging away his sack of tools or his back basket or his hod the fontis were due to different causes the friability of the soil some landslip at a depth beyond the reach of man the violent summer rains the incessant flooding
1999,of winter long drizzling showers sometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil forced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them to bend aside or it chanced that a flooring vault burst and split under this crushing thrust in this manner the heaping up of the parthenon obliterated a century ago a portion of the vaults of saint genevieve hill when a sewer was broken in under the pressure of the houses the mischief was sometimes betrayed in the street above by a sort of space like the teeth of a saw between the paving stones this crevice was developed in an undulating line throughout the entire length of the cracked vault and then the evil being visible the remedy could be promptly applied it also frequently happened that the interior ravages were not revealed by any external scar and in that case woe to the sewermen when they entered without precaution into the sewer they were liable to be lost ancient registers make mention of several scavengers who were buried in fontis in this manner they give many names among others that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a
2000,quagmire under the man hole of the rue careme prenant a certain blaise poutrain this blaise poutrain was the brother of nicholas poutrain who was the last grave digger of the cemetery called the charnier des innocents in the epoch when that cemetery expired there was also that young and charming vicomte d'escoubleau of whom we have just spoken one of the heroes of the siege of lerida where they delivered the assault in silk stockings with violins at their head d'escoubleau surprised one night at his cousin's the duchess de sourdis was drowned in a quagmire of the beautreillis sewer in which he had taken refuge in order to escape from the duke madame de sourdis when informed of his death demanded her smelling bottle and forgot to weep through sniffling at her salts in such cases there is no love which holds fast the sewer extinguishes it hero refuses to wash the body of leander thisbe stops her nose in the presence of pyramus and says phew vi the fontis jean valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis this sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the champs elysees difficult to
2001,handle in the hydraulic works and a bad preservative of the subterranean constructions on account of its excessive fluidity this fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of the sands of the quartier saint georges which could only be conquered by a stone construction on a concrete foundation and the clayey strata infected with gas of the quartier des martyrs which are so liquid that the only way in which a passage was effected under the gallery des martyrs was by means of a cast iron pipe when in the old stone sewer beneath the faubourg saint honore in which we now see jean valjean was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing it the quicksand which forms the subsoil of the champs elysees as far as the seine presented such an obstacle that the operation lasted nearly six months to the great clamor of the dwellers on the riverside particularly those who had hotels and carriages the work was more than unhealthy it was dangerous it is true that they had four months and a half of rain and three floods of the seine the fontis which jean valjean had encountered was caused by the downpour of the preceding day the pavement
2002,badly sustained by the subjacent sand had given way and had produced a stoppage of the water infiltration had taken place a slip had followed the dislocated bottom had sunk into the ooze to what extent impossible to say the obscurity was more dense there than elsewhere it was a pit of mire in a cavern of night jean valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet he entered this slime there was water on the surface slime at the bottom he must pass it to retrace his steps was impossible marius was dying and jean valjean exhausted besides where was he to go jean valjean advanced moreover the pit seemed for the first few steps not to be very deep but in proportion as he advanced his feet plunged deeper soon he had the slime up to his calves and water above his knees he walked on raising marius in his arms as far above the water as he could the mire now reached to his knees and the water to his waist he could no longer retreat this mud dense enough for one man could not obviously uphold two marius and jean valjean would have stood a chance
2003,of extricating themselves singly jean valjean continued to advance supporting the dying man who was perhaps a corpse the water came up to his arm pits he felt that he was sinking it was only with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze which he had now reached the density which was his support was also an obstacle he still held marius on high and with an unheard of expenditure of force he advanced still but he was sinking he had only his head above the water now and his two arms holding up marius in the old paintings of the deluge there is a mother holding her child thus he sank still deeper he turned his face to the rear to escape the water and in order that he might be able to breathe anyone who had seen him in that gloom would have thought that what he beheld was a mask floating on the shadows he caught a faint glimpse above him of the drooping head and livid face of marius he made a desperate effort and launched his foot forward his foot struck something solid a point of support it was high time he
2004,straightened himself up and rooted himself upon that point of support with a sort of fury this produced upon him the effect of the first step in a staircase leading back to life the point of support thus encountered in the mire at the supreme moment was the beginning of the other water shed of the pavement which had bent but had not given way and which had curved under the water like a plank and in a single piece well built pavements form a vault and possess this sort of firmness this fragment of the vaulting partly submerged but solid was a veritable inclined plane and once on this plane he was safe jean valjean mounted this inclined plane and reached the other side of the quagmire as he emerged from the water he came in contact with a stone and fell upon his knees he reflected that this was but just and he remained there for some time with his soul absorbed in words addressed to god he rose to his feet shivering chilled foul smelling bowed beneath the dying man whom he was dragging after him all dripping with slime and his soul filled with a strange
2005,light vii one sometimes runs aground when one fancies that one is disembarking he set out on his way once more however although he had not left his life in the fontis he seemed to have left his strength behind him there that supreme effort had exhausted him his lassitude was now such that he was obliged to pause for breath every three or four steps and lean against the wall once he was forced to seat himself on the banquette in order to alter marius position and he thought that he should have to remain there but if his vigor was dead his energy was not he rose again he walked on desperately almost fast proceeded thus for a hundred paces almost without drawing breath and suddenly came in contact with the wall he had reached an elbow of the sewer and arriving at the turn with head bent down he had struck the wall he raised his eyes and at the extremity of the vault far very far away in front of him he perceived a light this time it was not that terrible light it was good white light it was daylight jean valjean saw the outlet
2006,a damned soul who in the midst of the furnace should suddenly perceive the outlet of gehenna would experience what jean valjean felt it would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that radiant portal jean valjean was no longer conscious of fatigue he no longer felt marius weight he found his legs once more of steel he ran rather than walked as he approached the outlet became more and more distinctly defined it was a pointed arch lower than the vault which gradually narrowed and narrower than the gallery which closed in as the vault grew lower the tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel a faulty construction imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries logical in a prison illogical in a sewer and which has since been corrected jean valjean reached the outlet there he halted it certainly was the outlet but he could not get out the arch was closed by a heavy grating and the grating which to all appearance rarely swung on its rusty hinges was clamped to its stone jamb by a thick lock which red with rust seemed like an enormous brick the keyhole could be seen and the robust
2007,latch deeply sunk in the iron staple the door was plainly double locked it was one of those prison locks which old paris was so fond of lavishing beyond the grating was the open air the river the daylight the shore very narrow but sufficient for escape the distant quays paris that gulf in which one so easily hides oneself the broad horizon liberty on the right down stream the bridge of jena was discernible on the left upstream the bridge of the invalides the place would have been a propitious one in which to await the night and to escape it was one of the most solitary points in paris the shore which faces the grand caillou flies were entering and emerging through the bars of the grating it might have been half past eight o'clock in the evening the day was declining jean valjean laid marius down along the wall on the dry portion of the vaulting then he went to the grating and clenched both fists round the bars the shock which he gave it was frenzied but it did not move the grating did not stir jean valjean seized the bars one after the other in
2008,the hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid and to make of it a lever wherewith to raise the door or to break the lock not a bar stirred the teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in their sockets no lever no prying possible the obstacle was invincible there was no means of opening the gate must he then stop there what was he to do what was to become of him he had not the strength to retrace his steps to recommence the journey which he had already taken besides how was he to again traverse that quagmire whence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle and after the quagmire was there not the police patrol which assuredly could not be twice avoided and then whither was he to go what direction should he pursue to follow the incline would not conduct him to his goal if he were to reach another outlet he would find it obstructed by a plug or a grating every outlet was undoubtedly closed in that manner chance had unsealed the grating through which he had entered but it was evident that all the
2009,other sewer mouths were barred he had only succeeded in escaping into a prison all was over everything that jean valjean had done was useless exhaustion had ended in failure they were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death and jean valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and quivering in the shadows he turned his back to the grating and fell upon the pavement hurled to earth rather than seated close to marius who still made no movement and with his head bent between his knees this was the last drop of anguish of what was he thinking during this profound depression neither of himself nor of marius he was thinking of cosette viii the torn coat tail in the midst of this prostration a hand was laid on his shoulder and a low voice said to him half shares some person in that gloom nothing so closely resembles a dream as despair jean valjean thought that he was dreaming he had heard no footsteps was it possible he raised his eyes a man stood before him this man was clad in a blouse his feet were bare he held his shoes in
2010,his left hand he had evidently removed them in order to reach jean valjean without allowing his steps to be heard jean valjean did not hesitate for an instant unexpected as was this encounter this man was known to him the man was thenardier although awakened so to speak with a start jean valjean accustomed to alarms and steeled to unforeseen shocks that must be promptly parried instantly regained possession of his presence of mind moreover the situation could not be made worse a certain degree of distress is no longer capable of a crescendo and thenardier himself could add nothing to this blackness of this night a momentary pause ensued thenardier raising his right hand to a level with his forehead formed with it a shade then he brought his eyelashes together by screwing up his eyes a motion which in connection with a slight contraction of the mouth characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoring to recognize another man he did not succeed jean valjean as we have just stated had his back turned to the light and he was moreover so disfigured so bemired so bleeding that he would have been unrecognizable in full
2011,noonday on the contrary illuminated by the light from the grating a cellar light it is true livid yet precise in its lividness thenardier as the energetic popular metaphor expresses it immediately leaped into jean valjean's eyes this inequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to jean valjean in that mysterious duel which was on the point of beginning between the two situations and the two men the encounter took place between jean valjean veiled and thenardier unmasked jean valjean immediately perceived that thenardier did not recognize him they surveyed each other for a moment in that half gloom as though taking each other's measure thenardier was the first to break the silence how are you going to manage to get out jean valjean made no reply thenardier continued it's impossible to pick the lock of that gate but still you must get out of this that is true said jean valjean well half shares then what do you mean by that you have killed that man that's all right i have the key thenardier pointed to marius he went on i don't know you but i want to help you you must be a friend jean valjean began
2012,to comprehend thenardier took him for an assassin thenardier resumed listen comrade you didn't kill that man without looking to see what he had in his pockets give me my half i'll open the door for you and half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key he added do you want to see how a key to liberty is made look here jean valjean remained stupid the expression belongs to the elder corneille to such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld was real it was providence appearing in horrible guise and his good angel springing from the earth in the form of thenardier thenardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his blouse drew out a rope and offered it to jean valjean hold on said he i'll give you the rope to boot what is the rope for you will need a stone also but you can find one outside there's a heap of rubbish what am i to do with a stone idiot you'll want to sling that stiff into the river you'll need a stone and a rope otherwise it would float on the water jean valjean took the rope
2013,there is no one who does not occasionally accept in this mechanical way thenardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred to him ah see here comrade how did you contrive to get out of that slough yonder i haven't dared to risk myself in it phew you don't smell good after a pause he added i'm asking you questions but you're perfectly right not to answer it's an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before the examining magistrate and then when you don't talk at all you run no risk of talking too loud that's no matter as i can't see your face and as i don't know your name you are wrong in supposing that i don't know who you are and what you want i twig you've broken up that gentleman a bit now you want to tuck him away somewhere the river that great hider of folly is what you want i'll get you out of your scrape helping a good fellow in a pinch is what suits me to a hair while expressing his approval of jean valjean's silence he endeavored to force him to talk he jostled his shoulder
2014,in an attempt to catch a sight of his profile and he exclaimed without however raising his tone apropos of that quagmire you're a hearty animal why didn't you toss the man in there jean valjean preserved silence thenardier resumed pushing the rag which served him as a cravat to the level of his adam's apple a gesture which completes the capable air of a serious man after all you acted wisely the workmen when they come to morrow to stop up that hole would certainly have found the stiff abandoned there and it might have been possible thread by thread straw by straw to pick up the scent and reach you some one has passed through the sewer who where did he get out was he seen to come out the police are full of cleverness the sewer is treacherous and tells tales of you such a find is a rarity it attracts attention very few people make use of the sewers for their affairs while the river belongs to everybody the river is the true grave at the end of a month they fish up your man in the nets at saint cloud well what does one care
2015,for that it's carrion who killed that man paris and justice makes no inquiries you have done well the more loquacious thenardier became the more mute was jean valjean again thenardier shook him by the shoulder now let's settle this business let's go shares you have seen my key show me your money thenardier was haggard fierce suspicious rather menacing yet amicable there was one singular circumstance thenardier's manners were not simple he had not the air of being wholly at his ease while affecting an air of mystery he spoke low from time to time he laid his finger on his mouth and muttered hush it was difficult to divine why there was no one there except themselves jean valjean thought that other ruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook not very far off and that thenardier did not care to share with them thenardier resumed let's settle up how much did the stiff have in his bags jean valjean searched his pockets it was his habit as the reader will remember to always have some money about him the mournful life of expedients to which he had been condemned imposed this as a law upon him on
2016,this occasion however he had been caught unprepared when donning his uniform of a national guardsman on the preceding evening he had forgotten dolefully absorbed as he was to take his pocket book he had only some small change in his fob he turned out his pocket all soaked with ooze and spread out on the banquette of the vault one louis d'or two five franc pieces and five or six large sous thenardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the neck you knocked him over cheap said he he set to feeling the pockets of jean valjean and marius with the greatest familiarity jean valjean who was chiefly concerned in keeping his back to the light let him have his way while handling marius coat thenardier with the skill of a pickpocket and without being noticed by jean valjean tore off a strip which he concealed under his blouse probably thinking that this morsel of stuff might serve later on to identify the assassinated man and the assassin however he found no more than the thirty francs that's true said he both of you together have no more than that and forgetting his motto half
2017,shares he took all he hesitated a little over the large sous after due reflection he took them also muttering never mind you cut folks throats too cheap altogether that done he once more drew the big key from under his blouse now my friend you must leave it's like the fair here you pay when you go out you have paid now clear out and he began to laugh had he in lending to this stranger the aid of his key and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin we may be permitted to doubt this thenardier helped jean valjean to replace marius on his shoulders then he betook himself to the grating on tiptoe and barefooted making jean valjean a sign to follow him looked out laid his finger on his mouth and remained for several seconds as though in suspense his inspection finished he placed the key in the lock the bolt slipped back and the gate swung open it neither grated nor squeaked it moved very softly it was obvious that this gate and those hinges carefully oiled were in the habit of
2018,opening more frequently than was supposed this softness was suspicious it hinted at furtive goings and comings silent entrances and exits of nocturnal men and the wolf like tread of crime the sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band this taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods thenardier opened the gate a little way allowing just sufficient space for jean valjean to pass out closed the grating again gave the key a double turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness without making any more noise than a breath he seemed to walk with the velvet paws of a tiger a moment later that hideous providence had retreated into the invisibility jean valjean found himself in the open air ix marius produces on some one who is a judge of the matter the effect of being dead he allowed marius to slide down upon the shore they were in the open air the miasmas darkness horror lay behind him the pure healthful living joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him everywhere around him reigned silence but that charming silence when the sun has set in an unclouded azure sky twilight had descended night
2019,was drawing on the great deliverer the friend of all those who need a mantle of darkness that they may escape from an anguish the sky presented itself in all directions like an enormous calm the river flowed to his feet with the sound of a kiss the aerial dialogue of the nests bidding each other good night in the elms of the champs elysees was audible a few stars daintily piercing the pale blue of the zenith and visible to revery alone formed imperceptible little splendors amid the immensity evening was unfolding over the head of jean valjean all the sweetness of the infinite it was that exquisite and undecided hour which says neither yes nor no night was already sufficiently advanced to render it possible to lose oneself at a little distance and yet there was sufficient daylight to permit of recognition at close quarters for several seconds jean valjean was irresistibly overcome by that august and caressing serenity such moments of oblivion do come to men suffering refrains from harassing the unhappy wretch everything is eclipsed in the thoughts peace broods over the dreamer like night and beneath the twilight which beams and in imitation of the
2020,sky which is illuminated the soul becomes studded with stars jean valjean could not refrain from contemplating that vast clear shadow which rested over him thoughtfully he bathed in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in the majestic silence of the eternal heavens then he bent down swiftly to marius as though the sentiment of duty had returned to him and dipping up water in the hollow of his hand he gently sprinkled a few drops on the latter's face marius eyelids did not open but his half open mouth still breathed jean valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river once more when all at once he experienced an indescribable embarrassment such as a person feels when there is some one behind him whom he does not see we have already alluded to this impression with which everyone is familiar he turned round some one was in fact behind him as there had been a short while before a man of lofty stature enveloped in a long coat with folded arms and bearing in his right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head was visible stood a few paces in the rear of the
2021,spot where jean valjean was crouching over marius with the aid of the darkness it seemed a sort of apparition an ordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight a thoughtful man on account of the bludgeon jean valjean recognized javert the reader has divined no doubt that thenardier's pursuer was no other than javert javert after his unlooked for escape from the barricade had betaken himself to the prefecture of police had rendered a verbal account to the prefect in person in a brief audience had then immediately gone on duty again which implied the note the reader will recollect which had been captured on his person a certain surveillance of the shore on the right bank of the seine near the champs elysees which had for some time past aroused the attention of the police there he had caught sight of thenardier and had followed him the reader knows the rest thus it will be easily understood that that grating so obligingly opened to jean valjean was a bit of cleverness on thenardier's part thenardier intuitively felt that javert was still there the man spied upon has a scent which never deceives him it was necessary
2022,to fling a bone to that sleuth hound an assassin what a godsend such an opportunity must never be allowed to slip thenardier by putting jean valjean outside in his stead provided a prey for the police forced them to relinquish his scent made them forget him in a bigger adventure repaid javert for his waiting which always flatters a spy earned thirty francs and counted with certainty so far as he himself was concerned on escaping with the aid of this diversion jean valjean had fallen from one danger upon another these two encounters this falling one after the other from thenardier upon javert was a rude shock javert did not recognize jean valjean who as we have stated no longer looked like himself he did not unfold his arms he made sure of his bludgeon in his fist by an imperceptible movement and said in a curt calm voice who are you i who is i jean valjean javert thrust his bludgeon between his teeth bent his knees inclined his body laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of jean valjean which were clamped within them as in a couple of vices scrutinized him and recognized him
2023,their faces almost touched javert's look was terrible jean valjean remained inert beneath javert's grasp like a lion submitting to the claws of a lynx inspector javert said he you have me in your power moreover i have regarded myself as your prisoner ever since this morning i did not give you my address with any intention of escaping from you take me only grant me one favor javert did not appear to hear him he kept his eyes riveted on jean valjean his chin being contracted thrust his lips upwards towards his nose a sign of savage revery at length he released jean valjean straightened himself stiffly up without bending grasped his bludgeon again firmly and as though in a dream he murmured rather than uttered this question what are you doing here and who is this man he still abstained from addressing jean valjean as thou jean valjean replied and the sound of his voice appeared to rouse javert it is with regard to him that i desire to speak to you dispose of me as you see fit but first help me to carry him home that is all that i ask of you javert's face contracted
2024,as was always the case when any one seemed to think him capable of making a concession nevertheless he did not say no again he bent over drew from his pocket a handkerchief which he moistened in the water and with which he then wiped marius blood stained brow this man was at the barricade said he in a low voice and as though speaking to himself he is the one they called marius a spy of the first quality who had observed everything listened to everything and taken in everything even when he thought that he was to die who had played the spy even in his agony and who with his elbows leaning on the first step of the sepulchre had taken notes he seized marius hand and felt his pulse he is wounded said jean valjean he is a dead man said javert jean valjean replied no not yet so you have brought him thither from the barricade remarked javert his preoccupation must indeed have been very profound for him not to insist on this alarming rescue through the sewer and for him not to even notice jean valjean's silence after his question jean valjean on his
2025,side seemed to have but one thought he resumed he lives in the marais rue des filles du calvaire with his grandfather i do not recollect his name jean valjean fumbled in marius coat pulled out his pocket book opened it at the page which marius had pencilled and held it out to javert there was still sufficient light to admit of reading besides this javert possessed in his eye the feline phosphorescence of night birds he deciphered the few lines written by marius and muttered gillenormand rue des filles du calvaire no then he exclaimed coachman the reader will remember that the hackney coach was waiting in case of need javert kept marius pocket book a moment later the carriage which had descended by the inclined plane of the watering place was on the shore marius was laid upon the back seat and javert seated himself on the front seat beside jean valjean the door slammed and the carriage drove rapidly away ascending the quays in the direction of the bastille they quitted the quays and entered the streets the coachman a black form on his box whipped up his thin horses a glacial silence reigned in the carriage
2026,marius motionless with his body resting in the corner and his head drooping on his breast his arms hanging his legs stiff seemed to be awaiting only a coffin jean valjean seemed made of shadow and javert of stone and in that vehicle full of night whose interior every time that it passed in front of a street lantern appeared to be turned lividly wan as by an intermittent flash of lightning chance had united and seemed to be bringing face to face the three forms of tragic immobility the corpse the spectre and the statue x return of the son who was prodigal of his life at every jolt over the pavement a drop of blood trickled from marius hair night had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at no rue des filles du calvaire javert was the first to alight he made sure with one glance of the number on the carriage gate and raising the heavy knocker of beaten iron embellished in the old style with a male goat and a satyr confronting each other he gave a violent peal the gate opened a little way and javert gave it a push the porter half made
2027,his appearance yawning vaguely awake and with a candle in his hand everyone in the house was asleep people go to bed betimes in the marais especially on days when there is a revolt this good old quarter terrified at the revolution takes refuge in slumber as children when they hear the bugaboo coming hide their heads hastily under their coverlet in the meantime jean valjean and the coachman had taken marius out of the carriage jean valjean supporting him under the armpits and the coachman under the knees as they thus bore marius jean valjean slipped his hand under the latter's clothes which were broadly rent felt his breast and assured himself that his heart was still beating it was even beating a little less feebly as though the movement of the carriage had brought about a certain fresh access of life javert addressed the porter in a tone befitting the government and the presence of the porter of a factious person some person whose name is gillenormand here what do you want with him his son is brought back his son said the porter stupidly he is dead jean valjean who soiled and tattered stood behind javert and
2028,whom the porter was surveying with some horror made a sign to him with his head that this was not so the porter did not appear to understand either javert's words or jean valjean's sign javert continued he went to the barricade and here he is to the barricade ejaculated the porter he has got himself killed go waken his father the porter did not stir go along with you repeated javert and he added there will be a funeral here to morrow for javert the usual incidents of the public highway were categorically classed which is the beginning of foresight and surveillance and each contingency had its own compartment all possible facts were arranged in drawers as it were whence they emerged on occasion in variable quantities in the street uproar revolt carnival and funeral the porter contented himself with waking basque basque woke nicolette nicolette roused great aunt gillenormand as for the grandfather they let him sleep on thinking that he would hear about the matter early enough in any case marius was carried up to the first floor without any one in the other parts of the house being aware of the fact and deposited on an
2029,old sofa in m gillenormand's antechamber and while basque went in search of a physician and while nicolette opened the linen presses jean valjean felt javert touch him on the shoulder he understood and descended the stairs having behind him the step of javert who was following him the porter watched them take their departure as he had watched their arrival in terrified somnolence they entered the carriage once more and the coachman mounted his box inspector javert said jean grant me yet another favor what is it demanded javert roughly let me go home for one instant then you shall do whatever you like with me javert remained silent for a few moments with his chin drawn back into the collar of his great coat then he lowered the glass and front driver said he rue de l'homme arme no xi concussion in the absolute they did not open their lips again during the whole space of their ride what did jean valjean want to finish what he had begun to warn cosette to tell her where marius was to give her possibly some other useful information to take if he could certain final measures as for himself so
2030,far as he was personally concerned all was over he had been seized by javert and had not resisted any other man than himself in like situation would perhaps have had some vague thoughts connected with the rope which thenardier had given him and of the bars of the first cell that he should enter but let us impress it upon the reader after the bishop there had existed in jean valjean a profound hesitation in the presence of any violence even when directed against himself suicide that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which may contain in a measure the death of the soul was impossible to jean valjean at the entrance to the rue de l'homme arme the carriage halted the way being too narrow to admit of the entrance of vehicles javert and jean valjean alighted the coachman humbly represented to monsieur l'inspecteur that the utrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood of the assassinated man and with mire from the assassin that is the way he understood it he added that an indemnity was due him at the same time drawing his certificate book from his pocket he begged the inspector
2031,to have the goodness to write him a bit of an attestation javert thrust aside the book which the coachman held out to him and said how much do you want including your time of waiting and the drive it comes to seven hours and a quarter replied the man and my velvet was perfectly new eighty francs mr inspector javert drew four napoleons from his pocket and dismissed the carriage jean valjean fancied that it was javert's intention to conduct him on foot to the post of the blancs manteaux or to the post of the archives both of which are close at hand they entered the street it was deserted as usual javert followed jean valjean they reached no jean valjean knocked the door opened it is well said javert go up stairs he added with a strange expression and as though he were exerting an effort in speaking in this manner i will wait for you here jean valjean looked at javert this mode of procedure was but little in accord with javert's habits however he could not be greatly surprised that javert should now have a sort of haughty confidence in him the confidence of the
2032,cat which grants the mouse liberty to the length of its claws seeing that jean valjean had made up his mind to surrender himself and to make an end of it he pushed open the door entered the house called to the porter who was in bed and who had pulled the cord from his couch it is i and ascended the stairs on arriving at the first floor he paused all sorrowful roads have their stations the window on the landing place which was a sash window was open as in many ancient houses the staircase got its light from without and had a view on the street the street lantern situated directly opposite cast some light on the stairs and thus effected some economy in illumination jean valjean either for the sake of getting the air or mechanically thrust his head out of this window he leaned out over the street it is short and the lantern lighted it from end to end jean valjean was overwhelmed with amazement there was no longer any one there javert had taken his departure xii the grandfather basque and the porter had carried marius into the drawing room as he still
2033,lay stretched out motionless on the sofa upon which he had been placed on his arrival the doctor who had been sent for had hastened thither aunt gillenormand had risen aunt gillenormand went and came in affright wringing her hands and incapable of doing anything but saying heavens is it possible at times she added everything will be covered with blood when her first horror had passed off a certain philosophy of the situation penetrated her mind and took form in the exclamation it was bound to end in this way she did not go so far as i told you so which is customary on this sort of occasion at the physician's orders a camp bed had been prepared beside the sofa the doctor examined marius and after having found that his pulse was still beating that the wounded man had no very deep wound on his breast and that the blood on the corners of his lips proceeded from his nostrils he had him placed flat on the bed without a pillow with his head on the same level as his body and even a trifle lower and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration mademoiselle
2034,gillenormand on perceiving that they were undressing marius withdrew she set herself to telling her beads in her own chamber the trunk had not suffered any internal injury a bullet deadened by the pocket book had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with a hideous laceration which was of no great depth and consequently not dangerous the long underground journey had completed the dislocation of the broken collar bone and the disorder there was serious the arms had been slashed with sabre cuts not a single scar disfigured his face but his head was fairly covered with cuts what would be the result of these wounds on the head would they stop short at the hairy cuticle or would they attack the brain as yet this could not be decided a grave symptom was that they had caused a swoon and that people do not always recover from such swoons moreover the wounded man had been exhausted by hemorrhage from the waist down the barricade had protected the lower part of the body from injury basque and nicolette tore up linen and prepared bandages nicolette sewed them basque rolled them as lint was lacking the doctor for
2035,the time being arrested the bleeding with layers of wadding beside the bed three candles burned on a table where the case of surgical instruments lay spread out the doctor bathed marius face and hair with cold water a full pail was reddened in an instant the porter candle in hand lighted them the doctor seemed to be pondering sadly from time to time he made a negative sign with his head as though replying to some question which he had inwardly addressed to himself a bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the doctor with himself at the moment when the doctor was wiping marius face and lightly touching his still closed eyes with his finger a door opened at the end of the drawing room and a long pallid figure made its appearance this was the grandfather the revolt had for the past two days deeply agitated enraged and engrossed the mind of m gillenormand he had not been able to sleep on the previous night and he had been in a fever all day long in the evening he had gone to bed very early recommending that everything in the house should be
2036,well barred and he had fallen into a doze through sheer fatigue old men sleep lightly m gillenormand's chamber adjoined the drawing room and in spite of all the precautions that had been taken the noise had awakened him surprised at the rift of light which he saw under his door he had risen from his bed and had groped his way thither he stood astonished on the threshold one hand on the handle of the half open door with his head bent a little forward and quivering his body wrapped in a white dressing gown which was straight and as destitute of folds as a winding sheet and he had the air of a phantom who is gazing into a tomb he saw the bed and on the mattress that young man bleeding white with a waxen whiteness with closed eyes and gaping mouth and pallid lips stripped to the waist slashed all over with crimson wounds motionless and brilliantly lighted up the grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified limbs can tremble his eyes whose corneae were yellow on account of his great age were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter his whole face
2037,assumed in an instant the earthy angles of a skull his arms fell pendent as though a spring had broken and his amazement was betrayed by the outspreading of the fingers of his two aged hands which quivered all over his knees formed an angle in front allowing through the opening in his dressing gown a view of his poor bare legs all bristling with white hairs and he murmured marius sir said basque monsieur has just been brought back he went to the barricade and he is dead cried the old man in a terrible voice ah the rascal then a sort of sepulchral transformation straightened up this centenarian as erect as a young man sir said he you are the doctor begin by telling me one thing he is dead is he not the doctor who was at the highest pitch of anxiety remained silent m gillenormand wrung his hands with an outburst of terrible laughter he is dead he is dead he is dead he has got himself killed on the barricades out of hatred to me he did that to spite me ah you blood drinker this is the way he returns to me misery of
2038,my life he is dead he went to the window threw it wide open as though he were stifling and erect before the darkness he began to talk into the street to the night pierced sabred exterminated slashed hacked in pieces just look at that the villain he knew well that i was waiting for him and that i had had his room arranged and that i had placed at the head of my bed his portrait taken when he was a little child he knew well that he had only to come back and that i had been recalling him for years and that i remained by my fireside with my hands on my knees not knowing what to do and that i was mad over it you knew well that you had but to return and to say it is i and you would have been the master of the house and that i should have obeyed you and that you could have done whatever you pleased with your old numskull of a grandfather you knew that well and you said no he is a royalist i will not go and you went to the barricades and you
2039,got yourself killed out of malice to revenge yourself for what i said to you about monsieur le duc de berry it is infamous go to bed then and sleep tranquilly he is dead and this is my awakening the doctor who was beginning to be uneasy in both quarters quitted marius for a moment went to m gillenormand and took his arm the grandfather turned round gazed at him with eyes which seemed exaggerated in size and bloodshot and said to him calmly i thank you sir i am composed i am a man i witnessed the death of louis xvi i know how to bear events one thing is terrible and that is to think that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief you will have scribblers chatterers lawyers orators tribunes discussions progress enlightenment the rights of man the liberty of the press and this is the way that your children will be brought home to you ah marius it is abominable killed dead before me a barricade ah the scamp doctor you live in this quarter i believe oh i know you well i see your cabriolet pass my window i am going to tell
2040,you you are wrong to think that i am angry one does not fly into a rage against a dead man that would be stupid this is a child whom i have reared i was already old while he was very young he played in the tuileries garden with his little shovel and his little chair and in order that the inspectors might not grumble i stopped up the holes that he made in the earth with his shovel with my cane one day he exclaimed down with louis xviii and off he went it was no fault of mine he was all rosy and blond his mother is dead have you ever noticed that all little children are blond why is it so he is the son of one of those brigands of the loire but children are innocent of their fathers crimes i remember when he was no higher than that he could not manage to pronounce his ds he had a way of talking that was so sweet and indistinct that you would have thought it was a bird chirping i remember that once in front of the hercules farnese people formed a circle to admire him
2041,and marvel at him he was so handsome was that child he had a head such as you see in pictures i talked in a deep voice and i frightened him with my cane but he knew very well that it was only to make him laugh in the morning when he entered my room i grumbled but he was like the sunlight to me all the same one cannot defend oneself against those brats they take hold of you they hold you fast they never let you go again the truth is that there never was a cupid like that child now what can you say for your lafayettes your benjamin constants and your tirecuir de corcelles who have killed him this cannot be allowed to pass in this fashion he approached marius who still lay livid and motionless and to whom the physician had returned and began once more to wring his hands the old man's pallid lips moved as though mechanically and permitted the passage of words that were barely audible like breaths in the death agony ah heartless lad ah clubbist ah wretch ah septembrist reproaches in the low voice of an agonizing man addressed to
2042,a corpse little by little as it is always indispensable that internal eruptions should come to the light the sequence of words returned but the grandfather appeared no longer to have the strength to utter them his voice was so weak and extinct that it seemed to come from the other side of an abyss it is all the same to me i am going to die too that i am and to think that there is not a hussy in paris who would not have been delighted to make this wretch happy a scamp who instead of amusing himself and enjoying life went off to fight and get himself shot down like a brute and for whom why for the republic instead of going to dance at the chaumiere as it is the duty of young folks to do what's the use of being twenty years old the republic a cursed pretty folly poor mothers beget fine boys do come he is dead that will make two funerals under the same carriage gate so you have got yourself arranged like this for the sake of general lamarque's handsome eyes what had that general lamarque done to you a slasher
2043,a chatter box to get oneself killed for a dead man if that isn't enough to drive any one mad just think of it at twenty and without so much as turning his head to see whether he was not leaving something behind him that's the way poor good old fellows are forced to die alone now adays perish in your corner owl well after all so much the better that is what i was hoping for this will kill me on the spot i am too old i am a hundred years old i am a hundred thousand years old i ought by rights to have been dead long ago this blow puts an end to it so all is over what happiness what is the good of making him inhale ammonia and all that parcel of drugs you are wasting your trouble you fool of a doctor come he's dead completely dead i know all about it i am dead myself too he hasn't done things by half yes this age is infamous infamous and that's what i think of you of your ideas of your systems of your masters of your oracles of your doctors of your
2044,scape graces of writers of your rascally philosophers and of all the revolutions which for the last sixty years have been frightening the flocks of crows in the tuileries but you were pitiless in getting yourself killed like this i shall not even grieve over your death do you understand you assassin at that moment marius slowly opened his eyes and his glance still dimmed by lethargic wonder rested on m gillenormand marius cried the old man marius my little marius my child my well beloved son you open your eyes you gaze upon me you are alive thanks and he fell fainting fourth javert derailed i javert javert passed slowly down the rue de l'homme arme he walked with drooping head for the first time in his life and likewise for the first time in his life with his hands behind his back up to that day javert had borrowed from napoleon's attitudes only that which is expressive of resolution with arms folded across the chest that which is expressive of uncertainty with the hands behind the back had been unknown to him now a change had taken place his whole person slow and sombre was stamped with anxiety
2045,he plunged into the silent streets nevertheless he followed one given direction he took the shortest cut to the seine reached the quai des ormes skirted the quay passed the greve and halted at some distance from the post of the place du chatelet at the angle of the pont notre dame there between the notre dame and the pont au change on the one hand and the quai de la megisserie and the quai aux fleurs on the other the seine forms a sort of square lake traversed by a rapid this point of the seine is dreaded by mariners nothing is more dangerous than this rapid hemmed in at that epoch and irritated by the piles of the mill on the bridge now demolished the two bridges situated thus close together augment the peril the water hurries in formidable wise through the arches it rolls in vast and terrible waves it accumulates and piles up there the flood attacks the piles of the bridges as though in an effort to pluck them up with great liquid ropes men who fall in there never re appear the best of swimmers are drowned there javert leaned both elbows on the
2046,parapet his chin resting in both hands and while his nails were mechanically twined in the abundance of his whiskers he meditated a novelty a revolution a catastrophe had just taken place in the depths of his being and he had something upon which to examine himself javert was undergoing horrible suffering for several hours javert had ceased to be simple he was troubled that brain so limpid in its blindness had lost its transparency that crystal was clouded javert felt duty divided within his conscience and he could not conceal the fact from himself when he had so unexpectedly encountered jean valjean on the banks of the seine there had been in him something of the wolf which regains his grip on his prey and of the dog who finds his master again he beheld before him two paths both equally straight but he beheld two and that terrified him him who had never in all his life known more than one straight line and the poignant anguish lay in this that the two paths were contrary to each other one of these straight lines excluded the other which of the two was the true one his situation was
2047,indescribable to owe his life to a malefactor to accept that debt and to repay it to be in spite of himself on a level with a fugitive from justice and to repay his service with another service to allow it to be said to him go and to say to the latter in his turn be free to sacrifice to personal motives duty that general obligation and to be conscious in those personal motives of something that was also general and perchance superior to betray society in order to remain true to his conscience that all these absurdities should be realized and should accumulate upon him this was what overwhelmed him one thing had amazed him this was that jean valjean should have done him a favor and one thing petrified him that he javert should have done jean valjean a favor where did he stand he sought to comprehend his position and could no longer find his bearings what was he to do now to deliver up jean valjean was bad to leave jean valjean at liberty was bad in the first case the man of authority fell lower than the man of the galleys in the second
2048,a convict rose above the law and set his foot upon it in both cases dishonor for him javert there was disgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive destiny has some extremities which rise perpendicularly from the impossible and beyond which life is no longer anything but a precipice javert had reached one of those extremities one of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think the very violence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it thought was something to which he was unused and which was peculiarly painful in thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion and it irritated him to have that within him thought on any subject whatever outside of the restricted circle of his functions would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue thought on the day which had just passed was a torture nevertheless it was indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience after such shocks and render to himself an account of himself what he had just done made him shudder he javert had seen fit to decide contrary to all the regulations of the police contrary to the whole
2049,social and judicial organization contrary to the entire code upon a release this had suited him he had substituted his own affairs for the affairs of the public was not this unjustifiable every time that he brought himself face to face with this deed without a name which he had committed he trembled from head to foot upon what should he decide one sole resource remained to him to return in all haste to the rue de l'homme arme and commit jean valjean to prison it was clear that that was what he ought to do he could not something barred his way in that direction something what is there in the world anything outside of the tribunals executory sentences the police and the authorities javert was overwhelmed a galley slave sacred a convict who could not be touched by the law and that the deed of javert was it not a fearful thing that javert and jean valjean the man made to proceed with vigor the man made to submit that these two men who were both the things of the law should have come to such a pass that both of them had set themselves above the law
2050,what then such enormities were to happen and no one was to be punished jean valjean stronger than the whole social order was to remain at liberty and he javert was to go on eating the government's bread his revery gradually became terrible he might athwart this revery have also reproached himself on the subject of that insurgent who had been taken to the rue des filles du calvaire but he never even thought of that the lesser fault was lost in the greater besides that insurgent was obviously a dead man and legally death puts an end to pursuit jean valjean was the load which weighed upon his spirit jean valjean disconcerted him all the axioms which had served him as points of support all his life long had crumbled away in the presence of this man jean valjean's generosity towards him javert crushed him other facts which he now recalled and which he had formerly treated as lies and folly now recurred to him as realities m madeleine re appeared behind jean valjean and the two figures were superposed in such fashion that they now formed but one which was venerable javert felt that something terrible was penetrating
2051,his soul admiration for a convict respect for a galley slave is that a possible thing he shuddered at it yet could not escape from it in vain did he struggle he was reduced to confess in his inmost heart the sublimity of that wretch this was odious a benevolent malefactor merciful gentle helpful clement a convict returning good for evil giving back pardon for hatred preferring pity to vengeance preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy saving him who had smitten him kneeling on the heights of virtue more nearly akin to an angel than to a man javert was constrained to admit to himself that this monster existed things could not go on in this manner certainly and we insist upon this point he had not yielded without resistance to that monster to that infamous angel to that hideous hero who enraged almost as much as he amazed him twenty times as he sat in that carriage face to face with jean valjean the legal tiger had roared within him a score of times he had been tempted to fling himself upon jean valjean to seize him and devour him that is to say to
2052,arrest him what more simple in fact to cry out at the first post that they passed here is a fugitive from justice who has broken his ban to summon the gendarmes and say to them this man is yours then to go off leaving that condemned man there to ignore the rest and not to meddle further in the matter this man is forever a prisoner of the law the law may do with him what it will what could be more just javert had said all this to himself he had wished to pass beyond to act to apprehend the man and then as at present he had not been able to do it and every time that his arm had been raised convulsively towards jean valjean's collar his hand had fallen back again as beneath an enormous weight and in the depths of his thought he had heard a voice a strange voice crying to him it is well deliver up your savior then have the basin of pontius pilate brought and wash your claws then his reflections reverted to himself and beside jean valjean glorified he beheld himself javert degraded a convict was his benefactor but
2053,then why had he permitted that man to leave him alive he had the right to be killed in that barricade he should have asserted that right it would have been better to summon the other insurgents to his succor against jean valjean to get himself shot by force his supreme anguish was the loss of certainty he felt that he had been uprooted the code was no longer anything more than a stump in his hand he had to deal with scruples of an unknown species there had taken place within him a sentimental revelation entirely distinct from legal affirmation his only standard of measurement hitherto to remain in his former uprightness did not suffice a whole order of unexpected facts had cropped up and subjugated him a whole new world was dawning on his soul kindness accepted and repaid devotion mercy indulgence violences committed by pity on austerity respect for persons no more definitive condemnation no more conviction the possibility of a tear in the eye of the law no one knows what justice according to god running in inverse sense to justice according to men he perceived amid the shadows the terrible rising of an unknown moral
2054,sun it horrified and dazzled him an owl forced to the gaze of an eagle he said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional cases that authority might be put out of countenance that the rule might be inadequate in the presence of a fact that everything could not be framed within the text of the code that the unforeseen compelled obedience that the virtue of a convict might set a snare for the virtue of the functionary that destiny did indulge in such ambushes and he reflected with despair that he himself had not even been fortified against a surprise he was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist this convict had been good and he himself unprecedented circumstance had just been good also so he was becoming depraved he found that he was a coward he conceived a horror of himself javert's ideal was not to be human to be grand to be sublime it was to be irreproachable now he had just failed in this how had he come to such a pass how had all this happened he could not have told himself he clasped his head in both hands but in spite
2055,of all that he could do he could not contrive to explain it to himself he had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring jean valjean to the law of which jean valjean was the captive and of which he javert was the slave not for a single instant while he held him in his grasp had he confessed to himself that he entertained the idea of releasing him it was in some sort without his consciousness that his hand had relaxed and had let him go free all sorts of interrogation points flashed before his eyes he put questions to himself and made replies to himself and his replies frightened him he asked himself what has that convict done that desperate fellow whom i have pursued even to persecution and who has had me under his foot and who could have avenged himself and who owed it both to his rancor and to his safety in leaving me my life in showing mercy upon me his duty no something more and i in showing mercy upon him in my turn what have i done my duty no something more so there is something beyond duty here he took fright
2056,his balance became disjointed one of the scales fell into the abyss the other rose heavenward and javert was no less terrified by the one which was on high than by the one which was below without being in the least in the world what is called voltairian or a philosopher or incredulous being on the contrary respectful by instinct towards the established church he knew it only as an august fragment of the social whole order was his dogma and sufficed for him ever since he had attained to man's estate and the rank of a functionary he had centred nearly all his religion in the police being and here we employ words without the least irony and in their most serious acceptation being as we have said a spy as other men are priests he had a superior m gisquet up to that day he had never dreamed of that other superior god this new chief god he became unexpectedly conscious of and he felt embarrassed by him this unforeseen presence threw him off his bearings he did not know what to do with this superior he who was not ignorant of the fact that the subordinate is
2057,bound always to bow that he must not disobey nor find fault nor discuss and that in the presence of a superior who amazes him too greatly the inferior has no other resource than that of handing in his resignation but how was he to set about handing in his resignation to god however things might stand and it was to this point that he reverted constantly one fact dominated everything else for him and that was that he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law he had just shut his eyes on an escaped convict who had broken his ban he had just set a galley slave at large he had just robbed the laws of a man who belonged to them that was what he had done he no longer understood himself the very reasons for his action escaped him only their vertigo was left with him up to that moment he had lived with that blind faith which gloomy probity engenders this faith had quitted him this probity had deserted him all that he had believed in melted away truths which he did not wish to recognize were besieging him inexorably henceforth he must be
2058,a different man he was suffering from the strange pains of a conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract he saw that which it was repugnant to him to behold he felt himself emptied useless put out of joint with his past life turned out dissolved authority was dead within him he had no longer any reason for existing a terrible situation to be touched to be granite and to doubt to be the statue of chastisement cast in one piece in the mould of the law and suddenly to become aware of the fact that one cherishes beneath one's breast of bronze something absurd and disobedient which almost resembles a heart to come to the pass of returning good for good although one has said to oneself up to that day that that good is evil to be the watch dog and to lick the intruder's hand to be ice and melt to be the pincers and to turn into a hand to suddenly feel one's fingers opening to relax one's grip what a terrible thing the man projectile no longer acquainted with his route and retreating to be obliged to confess this to oneself infallibility is not infallible
2059,there may exist error in the dogma all has not been said when a code speaks society is not perfect authority is complicated with vacillation a crack is possible in the immutable judges are but men the law may err tribunals may make a mistake to behold a rift in the immense blue pane of the firmament that which was passing in javert was the fampoux of a rectilinear conscience the derailment of a soul the crushing of a probity which had been irresistibly launched in a straight line and was breaking against god it certainly was singular that the stoker of order that the engineer of authority mounted on the blind iron horse with its rigid road could be unseated by a flash of light that the immovable the direct the correct the geometrical the passive the perfect could bend that there should exist for the locomotive a road to damascus god always within man and refractory he the true conscience to the false a prohibition to the spark to die out an order to the ray to remember the sun an injunction to the soul to recognize the veritable absolute when confronted with the fictitious absolute humanity which
2060,cannot be lost the human heart indestructible that splendid phenomenon the finest perhaps of all our interior marvels did javert understand this did javert penetrate it did javert account for it to himself evidently he did not but beneath the pressure of that incontestable incomprehensibility he felt his brain bursting he was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy in all this he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence it seemed to him that henceforth his respiration was repressed forever he was not accustomed to having something unknown hanging over his head up to this point everything above him had been to his gaze merely a smooth limpid and simple surface there was nothing incomprehensible nothing obscure nothing that was not defined regularly disposed linked precise circumscribed exact limited closed fully provided for authority was a plane surface there was no fall in it no dizziness in its presence javert had never beheld the unknown except from below the irregular the unforeseen the disordered opening of chaos the possible slip over a precipice this was the work of the lower regions of rebels of the wicked of wretches now javert threw himself back and he was
2061,suddenly terrified by this unprecedented apparition a gulf on high what one was dismantled from top to bottom one was disconcerted absolutely in what could one trust that which had been agreed upon was giving way what the defect in society's armor could be discovered by a magnanimous wretch what an honest servitor of the law could suddenly find himself caught between two crimes the crime of allowing a man to escape and the crime of arresting him everything was not settled in the orders given by the state to the functionary there might be blind alleys in duty what all this was real was it true that an ex ruffian weighed down with convictions could rise erect and end by being in the right was this credible were there cases in which the law should retire before transfigured crime and stammer its excuses yes that was the state of the case and javert saw it and javert had touched it and not only could he not deny it but he had taken part in it these were realities it was abominable that actual facts could reach such deformity if facts did their duty they would confine themselves to being
2062,proofs of the law facts it is god who sends them was anarchy then on the point of now descending from on high thus and in the exaggeration of anguish and the optical illusion of consternation all that might have corrected and restrained this impression was effaced and society and the human race and the universe were henceforth summed up in his eyes in one simple and terrible feature thus the penal laws the thing judged the force due to legislation the decrees of the sovereign courts the magistracy the government prevention repression official cruelty wisdom legal infallibility the principle of authority all the dogmas on which rest political and civil security sovereignty justice public truth all this was rubbish a shapeless mass chaos he himself javert the spy of order incorruptibility in the service of the police the bull dog providence of society vanquished and hurled to earth and erect at the summit of all that ruin a man with a green cap on his head and a halo round his brow this was the astounding confusion to which he had come this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul was this to be endured no
2063,a violent state if ever such existed there were only two ways of escaping from it one was to go resolutely to jean valjean and restore to his cell the convict from the galleys the other javert quitted the parapet and with head erect this time betook himself with a firm tread towards the station house indicated by a lantern at one of the corners of the place du chatelet on arriving there he saw through the window a sergeant of police and he entered policemen recognize each other by the very way in which they open the door of a station house javert mentioned his name showed his card to the sergeant and seated himself at the table of the post on which a candle was burning on a table lay a pen a leaden inkstand and paper provided in the event of possible reports and the orders of the night patrols this table still completed by its straw seated chair is an institution it exists in all police stations it is invariably ornamented with a box wood saucer filled with sawdust and a wafer box of cardboard filled with red wafers and it forms the lowest stage of
2064,official style it is there that the literature of the state has its beginning javert took a pen and a sheet of paper and began to write this is what he wrote a few observations for the good of the service in the first place i beg monsieur le prefet to cast his eyes on this secondly prisoners on arriving after examination take off their shoes and stand barefoot on the flagstones while they are being searched many of them cough on their return to prison this entails hospital expenses thirdly the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police agents from distance to distance is good but on important occasions it is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight of each other so that in case one agent should for any cause grow weak in his service the other may supervise him and take his place fourthly it is inexplicable why the special regulation of the prison of the madelonettes interdicts the prisoner from having a chair even by paying for it fifthly in the madelonettes there are only two bars to the canteen so that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners
2065,with her hand sixthly the prisoners called barkers who summon the other prisoners to the parlor force the prisoner to pay them two sous to call his name distinctly this is a theft seventhly for a broken thread ten sous are withheld in the weaving shop this is an abuse of the contractor since the cloth is none the worse for it eighthly it is annoying for visitors to la force to be obliged to traverse the boys court in order to reach the parlor of sainte marie l'egyptienne ninthly it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheard relating in the court yard of the prefecture the interrogations put by the magistrates to prisoners for a gendarme who should be sworn to secrecy to repeat what he has heard in the examination room is a grave disorder tenthly mme henry is an honest woman her canteen is very neat but it is bad to have a woman keep the wicket to the mouse trap of the secret cells this is unworthy of the conciergerie of a great civilization javert wrote these lines in his calmest and most correct chirography not omitting a single comma and making the
2066,paper screech under his pen below the last line he signed javert inspector of the st class the post of the place du chatelet june th about one o'clock in the morning javert dried the fresh ink on the paper folded it like a letter sealed it wrote on the back note for the administration left it on the table and quitted the post the glazed and grated door fell to behind him again he traversed the place du chatelet diagonally regained the quay and returned with automatic precision to the very point which he had abandoned a quarter of an hour previously leaned on his elbows and found himself again in the same attitude on the same paving stone of the parapet he did not appear to have stirred the darkness was complete it was the sepulchral moment which follows midnight a ceiling of clouds concealed the stars not a single light burned in the houses of the city no one was passing all of the streets and quays which could be seen were deserted notre dame and the towers of the court house seemed features of the night a street lantern reddened the margin of the quay the
2067,outlines of the bridges lay shapeless in the mist one behind the other recent rains had swollen the river the spot where javert was leaning was it will be remembered situated precisely over the rapids of the seine perpendicularly above that formidable spiral of whirlpools which loose and knot themselves again like an endless screw javert bent his head and gazed all was black nothing was to be distinguished a sound of foam was audible but the river could not be seen at moments in that dizzy depth a gleam of light appeared and undulated vaguely water possessing the power of taking light no one knows whence and converting it into a snake the light vanished and all became indistinct once more immensity seemed thrown open there what lay below was not water it was a gulf the wall of the quay abrupt confused mingled with the vapors instantly concealed from sight produced the effect of an escarpment of the infinite nothing was to be seen but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor of the wet stones could be felt a fierce breath rose from this abyss the flood in the river divined rather than perceived
2068,the tragic whispering of the waves the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge the imaginable fall into that gloomy void into all that shadow was full of horror javert remained motionless for several minutes gazing at this opening of shadow he considered the invisible with a fixity that resembled attention the water roared all at once he took off his hat and placed it on the edge of the quay a moment later a tall black figure which a belated passer by in the distance might have taken for a phantom appeared erect upon the parapet of the quay bent over towards the seine then drew itself up again and fell straight down into the shadows a dull splash followed and the shadow alone was in the secret of the convulsions of that obscure form which had disappeared beneath the water fifth grandson and grandfather i in which the tree with the zinc plaster appears again some time after the events which we have just recorded sieur boulatruelle experienced a lively emotion sieur boulatruelle was that road mender of montfermeil whom the reader has already seen in the gloomy parts of this book boulatruelle as the reader may
2069,perchance recall was a man who was occupied with divers and troublesome matters he broke stones and damaged travellers on the highway road mender and thief as he was he cherished one dream he believed in the treasures buried in the forest of montfermeil he hoped some day to find the money in the earth at the foot of a tree in the meanwhile he lived to search the pockets of passers by nevertheless for an instant he was prudent he had just escaped neatly he had been as the reader is aware picked up in jondrette's garret in company with the other ruffians utility of a vice his drunkenness had been his salvation the authorities had never been able to make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber or a man who had been robbed an order of nolle prosequi founded on his well authenticated state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush had set him at liberty he had taken to his heels he had returned to his road from gagny to lagny to make under administrative supervision broken stone for the good of the state with downcast mien in a very
2070,pensive mood his ardor for theft somewhat cooled but he was addicted none the less tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him as for the lively emotion which he had experienced a short time after his return to his road mender's turf thatched cot here it is one morning boulatruelle while on his way as was his wont to his work and possibly also to his ambush a little before daybreak caught sight through the branches of the trees of a man whose back alone he saw but the shape of whose shoulders as it seemed to him at that distance and in the early dusk was not entirely unfamiliar to him boulatruelle although intoxicated had a correct and lucid memory a defensive arm that is indispensable to any one who is at all in conflict with legal order where the deuce have i seen something like that man yonder he said to himself but he could make himself no answer except that the man resembled some one of whom his memory preserved a confused trace however apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch boulatruelle put things together and made calculations this man did
2071,not belong in the country side he had just arrived there on foot evidently no public conveyance passes through montfermeil at that hour he had walked all night whence came he not from a very great distance for he had neither haversack nor bundle from paris no doubt why was he in these woods why was he there at such an hour what had he come there for boulatruelle thought of the treasure by dint of ransacking his memory he recalled in a vague way that he had already many years before had a similar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him the effect that he might well be this very individual by the deuce said boulatruelle i'll find him again i'll discover the parish of that parishioner this prowler of patron minette has a reason and i'll know it people can't have secrets in my forest if i don't have a finger in the pie he took his pick axe which was very sharply pointed there now he grumbled is something that will search the earth and a man and as one knots one thread to another thread he took up the line of march at
2072,his best pace in the direction which the man must follow and set out across the thickets when he had compassed a hundred strides the day which was already beginning to break came to his assistance footprints stamped in the sand weeds trodden down here and there heather crushed young branches in the brushwood bent and in the act of straightening themselves up again with the graceful deliberation of the arms of a pretty woman who stretches herself when she wakes pointed out to him a sort of track he followed it then lost it time was flying he plunged deeper into the woods and came to a sort of eminence an early huntsman who was passing in the distance along a path whistling the air of guillery suggested to him the idea of climbing a tree old as he was he was agile there stood close at hand a beech tree of great size worthy of tityrus and of boulatruelle boulatruelle ascended the beech as high as he was able the idea was a good one on scrutinizing the solitary waste on the side where the forest is thoroughly entangled and wild boulatruelle suddenly caught sight of his man
2073,hardly had he got his eye upon him when he lost sight of him the man entered or rather glided into an open glade at a considerable distance masked by large trees but with which boulatruelle was perfectly familiar on account of having noticed near a large pile of porous stones an ailing chestnut tree bandaged with a sheet of zinc nailed directly upon the bark this glade was the one which was formerly called the blaru bottom the heap of stones destined for no one knows what employment which was visible there thirty years ago is doubtless still there nothing equals a heap of stones in longevity unless it is a board fence they are temporary expedients what a reason for lasting boulatruelle with the rapidity of joy dropped rather than descended from the tree the lair was unearthed the question now was to seize the beast that famous treasure of his dreams was probably there it was no small matter to reach that glade by the beaten paths which indulge in a thousand teasing zigzags it required a good quarter of an hour in a bee line through the underbrush which is peculiarly dense very thorny and very
2074,aggressive in that locality a full half hour was necessary boulatruelle committed the error of not comprehending this he believed in the straight line a respectable optical illusion which ruins many a man the thicket bristling as it was struck him as the best road let's take to the wolves rue de rivoli said he boulatruelle accustomed to taking crooked courses was on this occasion guilty of the fault of going straight he flung himself resolutely into the tangle of undergrowth he had to deal with holly bushes nettles hawthorns eglantines thistles and very irascible brambles he was much lacerated at the bottom of the ravine he found water which he was obliged to traverse at last he reached the blaru bottom after the lapse of forty minutes sweating soaked breathless scratched and ferocious there was no one in the glade boulatruelle rushed to the heap of stones it was in its place it had not been carried off as for the man he had vanished in the forest he had made his escape where in what direction into what thicket impossible to guess and heartrending to say there behind the pile of stones in front of the tree with
2075,the sheet of zinc was freshly turned earth a pick axe abandoned or forgotten and a hole the hole was empty thief shrieked boulatruelle shaking his fist at the horizon ii marius emerging from civil war makes ready for domestic war for a long time marius was neither dead nor alive for many weeks he lay in a fever accompanied by delirium and by tolerably grave cerebral symptoms caused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than by the wounds themselves he repeated cosette's name for whole nights in the melancholy loquacity of fever and with the sombre obstinacy of agony the extent of some of the lesions presented a serious danger the suppuration of large wounds being always liable to become re absorbed and consequently to kill the sick man under certain atmospheric conditions at every change of weather at the slightest storm the physician was uneasy above all things he repeated let the wounded man be subjected to no emotion the dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult the fixation of apparatus and bandages by cerecloths not having been invented as yet at that epoch nicolette used up a sheet as big as the
2076,ceiling as she put it for lint it was not without difficulty that the chloruretted lotions and the nitrate of silver overcame the gangrene as long as there was any danger m gillenormand seated in despair at his grandson's pillow was like marius neither alive nor dead every day sometimes twice a day a very well dressed gentleman with white hair such was the description given by the porter came to inquire about the wounded man and left a large package of lint for the dressings finally on the th of september four months to a day after the sorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in a dying condition the doctor declared that he would answer for marius convalescence began but marius was forced to remain for two months more stretched out on a long chair on account of the results called up by the fracture of his collar bone there always is a last wound like that which will not close and which prolongs the dressings indefinitely to the great annoyance of the sick person however this long illness and this long convalescence saved him from all pursuit in france there is no wrath
2077,not even of a public character which six months will not extinguish revolts in the present state of society are so much the fault of every one that they are followed by a certain necessity of shutting the eyes let us add that the inexcusable gisquet order which enjoined doctors to lodge information against the wounded having outraged public opinion and not opinion alone but the king first of all the wounded were covered and protected by this indignation and with the exception of those who had been made prisoners in the very act of combat the councils of war did not dare to trouble any one so marius was left in peace m gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish and then through every form of ecstasy it was found difficult to prevent his passing every night beside the wounded man he had his big arm chair carried to marius bedside he required his daughter to take the finest linen in the house for compresses and bandages mademoiselle gillenormand like a sage and elderly person contrived to spare the fine linen while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed m gillenormand would not permit any one
2078,to explain to him that for the preparation of lint batiste is not nearly so good as coarse linen nor new linen as old linen he was present at all the dressings of the wounds from which mademoiselle gillenormand modestly absented herself when the dead flesh was cut away with scissors he said aie aie nothing was more touching than to see him with his gentle senile palsy offer the wounded man a cup of his cooling draught he overwhelmed the doctor with questions he did not observe that he asked the same ones over and over again on the day when the doctor announced to him that marius was out of danger the good man was in a delirium he made his porter a present of three louis that evening on his return to his own chamber he danced a gavotte using his thumb and forefinger as castanets and he sang the following song jeanne est nee a fougere amour tu vis en elle vrai nid d'une bergere car c'est dans sa prunelle j'adore son jupon que tu mets ton carquois fripon narquois moi je la chante et j'aime plus que diane meme jeanne et ses durs tetons bretons
2079,love thou dwellest in her for tis in her eyes that thou placest thy quiver sly scamp as for me i sing her and i love more than diana herself jeanne and her firm breton breasts then he knelt upon a chair and basque who was watching him through the half open door made sure that he was praying up to that time he had not believed in god at each succeeding phase of improvement which became more and more pronounced the grandfather raved he executed a multitude of mechanical actions full of joy he ascended and descended the stairs without knowing why a pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning at receiving a big bouquet it was m gillenormand who had sent it to her the husband made a jealous scene m gillenormand tried to draw nicolette upon his knees he called marius m le baron he shouted long live the republic every moment he kept asking the doctor is he no longer in danger he gazed upon marius with the eyes of a grandmother he brooded over him while he ate he no longer knew himself he no longer rendered himself an account of himself marius was the
2080,master of the house there was abdication in his joy he was the grandson of his grandson in the state of joy in which he then was he was the most venerable of children in his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent he stepped behind him to smile he was content joyous delighted charming young his white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay radiance of his visage when grace is mingled with wrinkles it is adorable there is an indescribable aurora in beaming old age as for marius as he allowed them to dress his wounds and care for him he had but one fixed idea cosette after the fever and delirium had left him he did not again pronounce her name and it might have been supposed that he no longer thought of her he held his peace precisely because his soul was there he did not know what had become of cosette the whole affair of the rue de la chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory shadows that were almost indistinct floated through his mind eponine gavroche mabeuf the thenardiers all his friends gloomily intermingled with the smoke of the barricade
2081,the strange passage of m fauchelevent through that adventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest he understood nothing connected with his own life he did not know how nor by whom he had been saved and no one of those around him knew this all that they had been able to tell him was that he had been brought home at night in a hackney coach to the rue des filles du calvaire past present future were nothing more to him than the mist of a vague idea but in that fog there was one immovable point one clear and precise outline something made of granite a resolution a will to find cosette once more for him the idea of life was not distinct from the idea of cosette he had decreed in his heart that he would not accept the one without the other and he was immovably resolved to exact of any person whatever who should desire to force him to live from his grandfather from fate from hell the restitution of his vanished eden he did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed let us here emphasize one detail he
2082,was not won over and was but little softened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather in the first place he was not in the secret then in his reveries of an invalid which were still feverish possibly he distrusted this tenderness as a strange and novel thing which had for its object his conquest he remained cold the grandfather absolutely wasted his poor old smile marius said to himself that it was all right so long as he marius did not speak and let things take their course but that when it became a question of cosette he would find another face and that his grandfather's true attitude would be unmasked then there would be an unpleasant scene a recrudescence of family questions a confrontation of positions every sort of sarcasm and all manner of objections at one and the same time fauchelevent coupelevent fortune poverty a stone about his neck the future violent resistance conclusion a refusal marius stiffened himself in advance and then in proportion as he regained life the old ulcers of his memory opened once more he reflected again on the past colonel pontmercy placed himself once more between m gillenormand and him
2083,marius he told himself that he had no true kindness to expect from a person who had been so unjust and so hard to his father and with health there returned to him a sort of harshness towards his grandfather the old man was gently pained by this m gillenormand without however allowing it to appear observed that marius ever since the latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness had not once called him father it is true that he did not say monsieur to him but he contrived not to say either the one or the other by means of a certain way of turning his phrases obviously a crisis was approaching as almost always happens in such cases marius skirmished before giving battle by way of proving himself this is called feeling the ground one morning it came to pass that m gillenormand spoke slightingly of the convention apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into his hands and gave vent to a royalist harangue on danton saint juste and robespierre the men of were giants said marius with severity the old man held his peace and uttered not a sound during the remainder
2084,of that day marius who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather of his early years interpreted this silence as a profound concentration of wrath augured from it a hot conflict and augmented his preparations for the fray in the inmost recesses of his mind he decided that in case of a refusal he would tear off his bandages dislocate his collar bone that he would lay bare all the wounds which he had left and would reject all food his wounds were his munitions of war he would have cosette or die he awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience of the sick that moment arrived iii marius attacked one day m gillenormand while his daughter was putting in order the phials and cups on the marble of the commode bent over marius and said to him in his tenderest accents look here my little marius if i were in your place i would eat meat now in preference to fish a fried sole is excellent to begin a convalescence with but a good cutlet is needed to put a sick man on his feet marius who had almost entirely recovered his strength collected the whole
2085,of it drew himself up into a sitting posture laid his two clenched fists on the sheets of his bed looked his grandfather in the face assumed a terrible air and said this leads me to say something to you what is it that i wish to marry agreed said his grandfather and he burst out laughing how agreed yes agreed you shall have your little girl marius stunned and overwhelmed with the dazzling shock trembled in every limb m gillenormand went on yes you shall have her that pretty little girl of yours she comes every day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you ever since you were wounded she has passed her time in weeping and making lint i have made inquiries she lives in the rue de l'homme arme no ah there we have it ah so you want her well you shall have her you're caught you had arranged your little plot you had said to yourself i'm going to signify this squarely to my grandfather to that mummy of the regency and of the directory to that ancient beau to that dorante turned geronte he has indulged in his frivolities also

2087,since you have been better of simply planting her at your bedside but it is only in romances that young girls are brought to the bedsides of handsome young wounded men who interest them it is not done what would your aunt have said to it you were nude three quarters of the time my good fellow ask nicolette who has not left you for a moment if there was any possibility of having a woman here and then what would the doctor have said a pretty girl does not cure a man of fever in short it's all right let us say no more about it all's said all's done it's all settled take her such is my ferocity you see i perceived that you did not love me i said to myself here now i have my little cosette right under my hand i'm going to give her to him he will be obliged to love me a little then or he must tell the reason why ah so you thought that the old man was going to storm to put on a big voice to shout no and to lift his cane at all that aurora not
2088,a bit of it cosette so be it love so be it i ask nothing better pray take the trouble of getting married sir be happy my well beloved child that said the old man burst forth into sobs and he seized marius head and pressed it with both arms against his breast and both fell to weeping this is one of the forms of supreme happiness father cried marius ah so you love me said the old man an ineffable moment ensued they were choking and could not speak at length the old man stammered come his mouth is unstopped at last he has said father to me marius disengaged his head from his grandfather's arms and said gently but father now that i am quite well it seems to me that i might see her agreed again you shall see her to morrow father what why not to day well to day then let it be to day you have called me father three times and it is worth it i will attend to it she shall be brought hither agreed i tell you it has already been put into verse this is the ending of the elegy
2089,of the jeune malade by andre chenier by andre chenier whose throat was cut by the ras by the giants of m gillenormand fancied that he detected a faint frown on the part of marius who in truth as we must admit was no longer listening to him and who was thinking far more of cosette than of the grandfather trembling at having so inopportunely introduced andre chenier resumed precipitately cut his throat is not the word the fact is that the great revolutionary geniuses who were not malicious that is incontestable who were heroes pardi found that andre chenier embarrassed them somewhat and they had him guillot that is to say those great men on the th of thermidor besought andre chenier in the interests of public safety to be so good as to go m gillenormand clutched by the throat by his own phrase could not proceed being able neither to finish it nor to retract it while his daughter arranged the pillow behind marius who was overwhelmed with so many emotions the old man rushed headlong with as much rapidity as his age permitted from the bed chamber shut the door behind him and purple choking and
2090,foaming at the mouth his eyes starting from his head he found himself nose to nose with honest basque who was blacking boots in the anteroom he seized basque by the collar and shouted full in his face in fury by the hundred thousand javottes of the devil those ruffians did assassinate him who sir andre chenier yes sir said basque in alarm iv mademoiselle gillenormand ends by no longer thinking it a bad thing that m fauchelevent should have entered with something under his arm cosette and marius beheld each other once more what that interview was like we decline to say there are things which one must not attempt to depict the sun is one of them the entire family including basque and nicolette were assembled in marius chamber at the moment when cosette entered it precisely at that moment the grandfather was on the point of blowing his nose he stopped short holding his nose in his handkerchief and gazing over it at cosette she appeared on the threshold it seemed to him that she was surrounded by a glory adorable he exclaimed then he blew his nose noisily cosette was intoxicated delighted frightened in heaven she
2091,was as thoroughly alarmed as any one can be by happiness she stammered all pale yet flushed she wanted to fling herself into marius arms and dared not ashamed of loving in the presence of all these people people are pitiless towards happy lovers they remain when the latter most desire to be left alone lovers have no need of any people whatever with cosette and behind her there had entered a man with white hair who was grave yet smiling though with a vague and heartrending smile it was monsieur fauchelevent it was jean valjean he was very well dressed as the porter had said entirely in black in perfectly new garments and with a white cravat the porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this correct bourgeois in this probable notary the fear inspiring bearer of the corpse who had sprung up at his door on the night of the th of june tattered muddy hideous haggard his face masked in blood and mire supporting in his arms the fainting marius still his porter's scent was aroused when m fauchelevent arrived with cosette the porter had not been able to refrain from communicating to his wife this
2092,aside i don't know why it is but i can't help fancying that i've seen that face before m fauchelevent in marius chamber remained apart near the door he had under his arm a package which bore considerable resemblance to an octavo volume enveloped in paper the enveloping paper was of a greenish hue and appeared to be mouldy does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm mademoiselle gillenormand who did not like books demanded in a low tone of nicolette well retorted m gillenormand who had overheard her in the same tone he's a learned man what then is that his fault monsieur boulard one of my acquaintances never walked out without a book under his arm either and he always had some old volume hugged to his heart like that and with a bow he said aloud monsieur tranchelevent father gillenormand did not do it intentionally but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic habit of his monsieur tranchelevent i have the honor of asking you on behalf of my grandson baron marius pontmercy for the hand of mademoiselle monsieur tranchelevent bowed that's settled said the grandfather and turning to marius and cosette with both
2093,arms extended in blessing he cried permission to adore each other they did not require him to repeat it twice so much the worse the chirping began they talked low marius resting on his elbow on his reclining chair cosette standing beside him oh heavens murmured cosette i see you once again it is thou it is you the idea of going and fighting like that but why it is horrible i have been dead for four months oh how wicked it was of you to go to that battle what had i done to you i pardon you but you will never do it again a little while ago when they came to tell us to come to you i still thought that i was about to die but it was from joy i was so sad i have not taken the time to dress myself i must frighten people with my looks what will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar do speak you let me do all the talking we are still in the rue de l'homme arme it seems that your shoulder was terrible they told me that you could put your fist
2094,in it and then it seems that they cut your flesh with the scissors that is frightful i have cried till i have no eyes left it is queer that a person can suffer like that your grandfather has a very kindly air don't disturb yourself don't rise on your elbow you will injure yourself oh how happy i am so our unhappiness is over i am quite foolish i had things to say to you and i no longer know in the least what they were do you still love me we live in the rue de l'homme arme there is no garden i made lint all the time stay sir look it is your fault i have a callous on my fingers angel said marius angel is the only word in the language which cannot be worn out no other word could resist the merciless use which lovers make of it then as there were spectators they paused and said not a word more contenting themselves with softly touching each other's hands m gillenormand turned towards those who were in the room and cried talk loud the rest of you make a noise you people behind the scenes
2095,come a little uproar the deuce so that the children can chatter at their ease and approaching marius and cosette he said to them in a very low voice call each other thou don't stand on ceremony aunt gillenormand looked on in amazement at this irruption of light in her elderly household there was nothing aggressive about this amazement it was not the least in the world like the scandalized and envious glance of an owl at two turtle doves it was the stupid eye of a poor innocent seven and fifty years of age it was a life which had been a failure gazing at that triumph love mademoiselle gillenormand senior said her father to her i told you that this is what would happen to you he remained silent for a moment and then added look at the happiness of others then he turned to cosette how pretty she is how pretty she is she's a greuze so you are going to have that all to yourself you scamp ah my rogue you are getting off nicely with me you are happy if i were not fifteen years too old we would fight with swords to see which
2096,of us should have her come now i am in love with you mademoiselle it's perfectly simple it is your right you are in the right ah what a sweet charming little wedding this will make our parish is saint denis du saint sacrament but i will get a dispensation so that you can be married at saint paul the church is better it was built by the jesuits it is more coquettish it is opposite the fountain of cardinal de birague the masterpiece of jesuit architecture is at namur it is called saint loup you must go there after you are married it is worth the journey mademoiselle i am quite of your mind i think girls ought to marry that is what they are made for there is a certain sainte catherine whom i should always like to see uncoiffed it's a fine thing to remain a spinster but it is chilly the bible says multiply in order to save the people jeanne d'arc is needed but in order to make people what is needed is mother goose so marry my beauties i really do not see the use in remaining a spinster i know that they have
2097,their chapel apart in the church and that they fall back on the society of the virgin but sapristi a handsome husband a fine fellow and at the expiration of a year a big blond brat who nurses lustily and who has fine rolls of fat on his thighs and who musses up your breast in handfuls with his little rosy paws laughing the while like the dawn that's better than holding a candle at vespers and chanting turris eburnea the grandfather executed a pirouette on his eighty year old heels and began to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more ainsi bornant les cours de tes revasseries alcippe il est donc vrai dans peu tu te maries by the way what is it father have not you an intimate friend yes courfeyrac what has become of him he is dead that is good he seated himself near them made cosette sit down and took their four hands in his aged and wrinkled hands she is exquisite this darling she's a masterpiece this cosette she is a very little girl and a very great lady she will only be a baroness which is a come down
2098,for her she was born a marquise what eyelashes she has get it well fixed in your noddles my children that you are in the true road love each other be foolish about it love is the folly of men and the wit of god adore each other only he added suddenly becoming gloomy what a misfortune it has just occurred to me more than half of what i possess is swallowed up in an annuity so long as i live it will not matter but after my death a score of years hence ah my poor children you will not have a sou your beautiful white hands madame la baronne will do the devil the honor of pulling him by the tail at this point they heard a grave and tranquil voice say mademoiselle euphrasie fauchelevent possesses six hundred thousand francs it was the voice of jean valjean so far he had not uttered a single word no one seemed to be aware that he was there and he had remained standing erect and motionless behind all these happy people what has mademoiselle euphrasie to do with the question inquired the startled grandfather i am she replied cosette six
2099,hundred thousand francs resumed m gillenormand minus fourteen or fifteen thousand francs possibly said jean valjean and he laid on the table the package which mademoiselle gillenormand had mistaken for a book jean valjean himself opened the package it was a bundle of bank notes they were turned over and counted there were five hundred notes for a thousand francs each and one hundred and sixty eight of five hundred in all five hundred and eighty four thousand francs this is a fine book said m gillenormand five hundred and eighty four thousand francs murmured the aunt this arranges things well does it not mademoiselle gillenormand senior said the grandfather that devil of a marius has ferreted out the nest of a millionaire grisette in his tree of dreams just trust to the love affairs of young folks now will you students find studentesses with six hundred thousand francs cherubino works better than rothschild five hundred and eighty four thousand francs repeated mademoiselle gillenormand in a low tone five hundred and eighty four one might as well say six hundred thousand as for marius and cosette they were gazing at each other while this was going on they hardly heeded
2100,this detail v deposit your money in a forest rather than with a notary the reader has no doubt understood without necessitating a lengthy explanation that jean valjean after the champmathieu affair had been able thanks to his first escape of a few days duration to come to paris and to withdraw in season from the hands of laffitte the sum earned by him under the name of monsieur madeleine at montreuil sur mer and that fearing that he might be recaptured which eventually happened he had buried and hidden that sum in the forest of montfermeil in the locality known as the blaru bottom the sum six hundred and thirty thousand francs all in bank bills was not very bulky and was contained in a box only in order to preserve the box from dampness he had placed it in a coffer filled with chestnut shavings in the same coffer he had placed his other treasures the bishop's candlesticks it will be remembered that he had carried off the candlesticks when he made his escape from montreuil sur mer the man seen one evening for the first time by boulatruelle was jean valjean later on every time that jean
2101,valjean needed money he went to get it in the blaru bottom hence the absences which we have mentioned he had a pickaxe somewhere in the heather in a hiding place known to himself alone when he beheld marius convalescent feeling that the hour was at hand when that money might prove of service he had gone to get it it was he again whom boulatruelle had seen in the woods but on this occasion in the morning instead of in the evening boulatreulle inherited his pickaxe the actual sum was five hundred and eighty four thousand five hundred francs jean valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for himself we shall see hereafter he thought the difference between that sum and the six hundred and thirty thousand francs withdrawn from laffitte represented his expenditure in ten years from to the five years of his stay in the convent had cost only five thousand francs jean valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney piece where they glittered to the great admiration of toussaint moreover jean valjean knew that he was delivered from javert the story had been told in his presence and he had verified the fact in the moniteur
2102,how a police inspector named javert had been found drowned under a boat belonging to some laundresses between the pont au change and the pont neuf and that a writing left by this man otherwise irreproachable and highly esteemed by his superiors pointed to a fit of mental aberration and a suicide in fact thought jean valjean since he left me at liberty once having got me in his power he must have been already mad vi the two old men do everything each one after his own fashion to render cosette happy everything was made ready for the wedding the doctor on being consulted declared that it might take place in february it was then december a few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed the grandfather was not the least happy of them all he remained for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at cosette the wonderful beautiful girl he exclaimed and she has so sweet and good an air she is without exception the most charming girl that i have ever seen in my life later on she'll have virtues with an odor of violets how graceful one cannot live otherwise than nobly with such
2103,a creature marius my boy you are a baron you are rich don't go to pettifogging i beg of you cosette and marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise the transition had not been softened and they would have been stunned had they not been dazzled by it do you understand anything about it said marius to cosette no replied cosette but it seems to me that the good god is caring for us jean valjean did everything smoothed away every difficulty arranged everything made everything easy he hastened towards cosette's happiness with as much ardor and apparently with as much joy as cosette herself as he had been a mayor he understood how to solve that delicate problem with the secret of which he alone was acquainted cosette's civil status if he were to announce her origin bluntly it might prevent the marriage who knows he extricated cosette from all difficulties he concocted for her a family of dead people a sure means of not encountering any objections cosette was the only scion of an extinct family cosette was not his own daughter but the daughter of the other fauchelevent two brothers fauchelevent had been gardeners to
2104,the convent of the petit picpus inquiry was made at that convent the very best information and the most respectable references abounded the good nuns not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity and not attaching any importance to the matter had never understood exactly of which of the two fauchelevents cosette was the daughter they said what was wanted and they said it with zeal an acte de notoriete was drawn up cosette became in the eyes of the law mademoiselle euphrasie fauchelevent she was declared an orphan both father and mother being dead jean valjean so arranged it that he was appointed under the name of fauchelevent as cosette's guardian with m gillenormand as supervising guardian over him as for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs they constituted a legacy bequeathed to cosette by a dead person who desired to remain unknown the original legacy had consisted of five hundred and ninety four thousand francs but ten thousand francs had been expended on the education of mademoiselle euphrasie five thousand francs of that amount having been paid to the convent this legacy deposited in the hands of a third party was to be
2105,turned over to cosette at her majority or at the date of her marriage this taken as a whole was very acceptable as the reader will perceive especially when the sum due was half a million there were some peculiarities here and there it is true but they were not noticed one of the interested parties had his eyes blindfolded by love the others by the six hundred thousand francs cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she had so long called father he was merely a kinsman another fauchelevent was her real father at any other time this would have broken her heart but at the ineffable moment which she was then passing through it cast but a slight shadow a faint cloud and she was so full of joy that the cloud did not last long she had marius the young man arrived the old man was effaced such is life and then cosette had for long years been habituated to seeing enigmas around her every being who has had a mysterious childhood is always prepared for certain renunciations nevertheless she continued to call jean valjean father cosette happy as the angels
2106,was enthusiastic over father gillenormand it is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments and presents while jean valjean was building up for cosette a normal situation in society and an unassailable status m gillenormand was superintending the basket of wedding gifts nothing so amused him as being magnificent he had given to cosette a robe of binche guipure which had descended to him from his own grandmother these fashions come up again said he ancient things are the rage and the young women of my old age dress like the old women of my childhood he rifled his respectable chests of drawers in coromandel lacquer with swelling fronts which had not been opened for years let us hear the confession of these dowagers he said let us see what they have in their paunches he noisily violated the pot bellied drawers of all his wives of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers pekins damasks lampas painted moires robes of shot gros de tours india kerchiefs embroidered in gold that could be washed dauphines without a right or wrong side in the piece genoa and alencon point lace parures in antique goldsmith's work ivory bon bon boxes
2107,ornamented with microscopic battles gewgaws and ribbons he lavished everything on cosette cosette amazed desperately in love with marius and wild with gratitude towards m gillenormand dreamed of a happiness without limit clothed in satin and velvet her wedding basket seemed to her to be upheld by seraphim her soul flew out into the azure depths with wings of mechlin lace the intoxication of the lovers was only equalled as we have already said by the ecstasy of the grandfather a sort of flourish of trumpets went on in the rue des filles du calvaire every morning a fresh offering of bric a brac from the grandfather to cosette all possible knickknacks glittered around her one day marius who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his bliss said apropos of i know not what incident the men of the revolution are so great that they have the prestige of the ages like cato and like phocion and each one of them seems to me an antique memory moire antique exclaimed the old gentleman thanks marius that is precisely the idea of which i was in search and on the following day a magnificent dress of tea rose
2108,colored moire antique was added to cosette's wedding presents from these fripperies the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom love is all very well but there must be something else to go with it the useless must be mingled with happiness happiness is only the necessary season that enormously with the superfluous for me a palace and her heart her heart and the louvre her heart and the grand waterworks of versailles give me my shepherdess and try to make her a duchess fetch me phyllis crowned with corn flowers and add a hundred thousand francs income open for me a bucolic perspective as far as you can see beneath a marble colonnade i consent to the bucolic and also to the fairy spectacle of marble and gold dry happiness resembles dry bread one eats but one does not dine i want the superfluous the useless the extravagant excess that which serves no purpose i remember to have seen in the cathedral of strasburg a clock as tall as a three story house which marked the hours which had the kindness to indicate the hour but which had not the air of being made for that and which after having
2109,struck midday or midnight midday the hour of the sun or midnight the hour of love or any other hour that you like gave you the moon and the stars the earth and the sea birds and fishes phoebus and phoebe and a host of things which emerged from a niche and the twelve apostles and the emperor charles the fifth and eponine and sabinus and a throng of little gilded goodmen who played on the trumpet to boot without reckoning delicious chimes which it sprinkled through the air on every occasion without any one's knowing why is a petty bald clock face which merely tells the hour equal to that for my part i am of the opinion of the big clock of strasburg and i prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the black forest m gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding and all the fripperies of the eighteenth century passed pell mell through his dithyrambs you are ignorant of the art of festivals you do not know how to organize a day of enjoyment in this age he exclaimed your nineteenth century is weak it lacks excess it ignores the rich it ignores the noble
2110,in everything it is clean shaven your third estate is insipid colorless odorless and shapeless the dreams of your bourgeois who set up as they express it a pretty boudoir freshly decorated violet ebony and calico make way make way the sieur curmudgeon is marrying mademoiselle clutch penny sumptuousness and splendor a louis d'or has been stuck to a candle there's the epoch for you my demand is that i may flee from it beyond the sarmatians ah in i predict that all was lost from the day when i beheld the duc de rohan prince de leon duc de chabot duc de montbazon marquis de sonbise vicomte de thouars peer of france go to longchamps in a tapecu that has borne its fruits in this century men attend to business they gamble on change they win money they are stingy people take care of their surfaces and varnish them every one is dressed as though just out of a band box washed soaped scraped shaved combed waked smoothed rubbed brushed cleaned on the outside irreproachable polished as a pebble discreet neat and at the same time death of my life in the depths of their consciences they have dung
2111,heaps and cesspools that are enough to make a cow herd who blows his nose in his fingers recoil i grant to this age the device dirty cleanliness don't be vexed marius give me permission to speak i say no evil of the people as you see i am always harping on your people but do look favorably on my dealing a bit of a slap to the bourgeoisie i belong to it he who loves well lashes well thereupon i say plainly that now a days people marry but that they no longer know how to marry ah it is true i regret the grace of the ancient manners i regret everything about them their elegance their chivalry those courteous and delicate ways that joyous luxury which every one possessed music forming part of the wedding a symphony above stairs a beating of drums below stairs the dances the joyous faces round the table the fine spun gallant compliments the songs the fireworks the frank laughter the devil's own row the huge knots of ribbon i regret the bride's garter the bride's garter is cousin to the girdle of venus on what does the war of troy turn on
2112,helen's garter parbleu why did they fight why did diomed the divine break over the head of meriones that great brazen helmet of ten points why did achilles and hector hew each other up with vast blows of their lances because helen allowed paris to take her garter with cosette's garter homer would construct the iliad he would put in his poem a loquacious old fellow like me and he would call him nestor my friends in bygone days in those amiable days of yore people married wisely they had a good contract and then they had a good carouse as soon as cujas had taken his departure gamacho entered but in sooth the stomach is an agreeable beast which demands its due and which wants to have its wedding also people supped well and had at table a beautiful neighbor without a guimpe so that her throat was only moderately concealed oh the large laughing mouths and how gay we were in those days youth was a bouquet every young man terminated in a branch of lilacs or a tuft of roses whether he was a shepherd or a warrior and if by chance one was a captain of
2113,dragoons one found means to call oneself florian people thought much of looking well they embroidered and tinted themselves a bourgeois had the air of a flower a marquis had the air of a precious stone people had no straps to their boots they had no boots they were spruce shining waved lustrous fluttering dainty coquettish which did not at all prevent their wearing swords by their sides the humming bird has beak and claws that was the day of the galland indies one of the sides of that century was delicate the other was magnificent and by the green cabbages people amused themselves to day people are serious the bourgeois is avaricious the bourgeoise is a prude your century is unfortunate people would drive away the graces as being too low in the neck alas beauty is concealed as though it were ugliness since the revolution everything including the ballet dancers has had its trousers a mountebank dancer must be grave your rigadoons are doctrinarian it is necessary to be majestic people would be greatly annoyed if they did not carry their chins in their cravats the ideal of an urchin of twenty when he marries is to resemble
2114,m royer collard and do you know what one arrives at with that majesty at being petty learn this joy is not only joyous it is great but be in love gayly then what the deuce marry when you marry with fever and giddiness and tumult and the uproar of happiness be grave in church well and good but as soon as the mass is finished sarpejou you must make a dream whirl around the bride a marriage should be royal and chimerical it should promenade its ceremony from the cathedral of rheims to the pagoda of chanteloup i have a horror of a paltry wedding ventregoulette be in olympus for that one day at least be one of the gods ah people might be sylphs games and laughter argiraspides they are stupids my friends every recently made bridegroom ought to be prince aldobrandini profit by that unique minute in life to soar away to the empyrean with the swans and the eagles even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into the bourgeoisie of the frogs don't economize on the nuptials do not prune them of their splendors don't scrimp on the day when you beam
2115,the wedding is not the housekeeping oh if i were to carry out my fancy it would be gallant violins would be heard under the trees here is my programme sky blue and silver i would mingle with the festival the rural divinities i would convoke the dryads and the nereids the nuptials of amphitrite a rosy cloud nymphs with well dressed locks and entirely naked an academician offering quatrains to the goddess a chariot drawn by marine monsters triton trottait devant et tirait de sa conque des sons si ravissants qu'il ravissait quiconque there's a festive programme there's a good one or else i know nothing of such matters deuce take it while the grandfather in full lyrical effusion was listening to himself cosette and marius grew intoxicated as they gazed freely at each other aunt gillenormand surveyed all this with her imperturbable placidity within the last five or six months she had experienced a certain amount of emotions marius returned marius brought back bleeding marius brought back from a barricade marius dead then living marius reconciled marius betrothed marius wedding a poor girl marius wedding a millionairess the six hundred thousand francs had been her last surprise then
2116,her indifference of a girl taking her first communion returned to her she went regularly to service told her beads read her euchology mumbled aves in one corner of the house while i love you was being whispered in the other and she beheld marius and cosette in a vague way like two shadows the shadow was herself there is a certain state of inert asceticism in which the soul neutralized by torpor a stranger to that which may be designated as the business of living receives no impressions either human or pleasant or painful with the exception of earthquakes and catastrophes this devotion as father gillenormand said to his daughter corresponds to a cold in the head you smell nothing of life neither any bad nor any good odor moreover the six hundred thousand francs had settled the elderly spinster's indecision her father had acquired the habit of taking her so little into account that he had not consulted her in the matter of consent to marius marriage he had acted impetuously according to his wont having a despot turned slave but a single thought to satisfy marius as for the aunt it had not even occurred to him
2117,that the aunt existed and that she could have an opinion of her own and sheep as she was this had vexed her somewhat resentful in her inmost soul but impassive externally she had said to herself my father has settled the question of the marriage without reference to me i shall settle the question of the inheritance without consulting him she was rich in fact and her father was not she had reserved her decision on this point it is probable that had the match been a poor one she would have left him poor so much the worse for my nephew he is wedding a beggar let him be a beggar himself but cosette's half million pleased the aunt and altered her inward situation so far as this pair of lovers were concerned one owes some consideration to six hundred thousand francs and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave her fortune to these young people since they did not need it it was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather m gillenormand insisted on resigning to them his chamber the finest in the house that will make me young again he
2118,said it's an old plan of mine i have always entertained the idea of having a wedding in my chamber he furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles he had the ceiling and walls hung with an extraordinary stuff which he had by him in the piece and which he believed to have emanated from utrecht with a buttercup colored satin ground covered with velvet auricula blossoms it was with that stuff said he that the bed of the duchesse d'anville at la roche guyon was draped on the chimney piece he set a little figure in saxe porcelain carrying a muff against her nude stomach m gillenormand's library became the lawyer's study which marius needed a study it will be remembered being required by the council of the order vii the effects of dreams mingled with happiness the lovers saw each other every day cosette came with m fauchelevent this is reversing things said mademoiselle gillenormand to have the bride come to the house to do the courting like this but marius convalescence had caused the habit to become established and the arm chairs of the rue des filles du calvaire better adapted to interviews than the
2119,straw chairs of the rue de l'homme arme had rooted it marius and m fauchelevent saw each other but did not address each other it seemed as though this had been agreed upon every girl needs a chaperon cosette could not have come without m fauchelevent in marius eyes m fauchelevent was the condition attached to cosette he accepted it by dint of discussing political matters vaguely and without precision from the point of view of the general amelioration of the fate of all men they came to say a little more than yes and no once on the subject of education which marius wished to have free and obligatory multiplied under all forms lavished on every one like the air and the sun in a word respirable for the entire population they were in unison and they almost conversed m fauchelevent talked well and even with a certain loftiness of language still he lacked something indescribable m fauchelevent possessed something less and also something more than a man of the world marius inwardly and in the depths of his thought surrounded with all sorts of mute questions this m fauchelevent who was to him simply benevolent and cold there
2120,were moments when doubts as to his own recollections occurred to him there was a void in his memory a black spot an abyss excavated by four months of agony many things had been lost therein he had come to the point of asking himself whether it were really a fact that he had seen m fauchelevent so serious and so calm a man in the barricade this was not however the only stupor which the apparitions and the disappearances of the past had left in his mind it must not be supposed that he was delivered from all those obsessions of the memory which force us even when happy even when satisfied to glance sadly behind us the head which does not turn backwards towards horizons that have vanished contains neither thought nor love at times marius clasped his face between his hands and the vague and tumultuous past traversed the twilight which reigned in his brain again he beheld mabeuf fall he heard gavroche singing amid the grape shot he felt beneath his lips the cold brow of eponine enjolras courfeyrac jean prouvaire combeferre bossuet grantaire all his friends rose erect before him then dispersed into thin air
2121,were all those dear sorrowful valiant charming or tragic beings merely dreams had they actually existed the revolt had enveloped everything in its smoke these great fevers create great dreams he questioned himself he felt himself all these vanished realities made him dizzy where were they all then was it really true that all were dead a fall into the shadows had carried off all except himself it all seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind the curtain of a theatre there are curtains like this which drop in life god passes on to the following act and he himself was he actually the same man he the poor man was rich he the abandoned had a family he the despairing was to marry cosette it seemed to him that he had traversed a tomb and that he had entered into it black and had emerged from it white and in that tomb the others had remained at certain moments all these beings of the past returned and present formed a circle around him and overshadowed him then he thought of cosette and recovered his serenity but nothing less than this felicity could have sufficed to efface that
2122,catastrophe m fauchelevent almost occupied a place among these vanished beings marius hesitated to believe that the fauchelevent of the barricade was the same as this fauchelevent in flesh and blood sitting so gravely beside cosette the first was probably one of those nightmares occasioned and brought back by his hours of delirium however the natures of both men were rigid no question from marius to m fauchelevent was possible such an idea had not even occurred to him we have already indicated this characteristic detail two men who have a secret in common and who by a sort of tacit agreement exchange not a word on the subject are less rare than is commonly supposed once only did marius make the attempt he introduced into the conversation the rue de la chanvrerie and turning to m fauchelevent he said to him of course you are acquainted with that street what street the rue de la chanvrerie i have no idea of the name of that street replied m fauchelevent in the most natural manner in the world the response which bore upon the name of the street and not upon the street itself appeared to marius to be more
2123,conclusive than it really was decidedly thought he i have been dreaming i have been subject to a hallucination it was some one who resembled him m fauchelevent was not there viii two men impossible to find marius enchantment great as it was could not efface from his mind other pre occupations while the wedding was in preparation and while awaiting the date fixed upon he caused difficult and scrupulous retrospective researches to be made he owed gratitude in various quarters he owed it on his father's account he owed it on his own there was thenardier there was the unknown man who had brought him marius back to m gillenormand marius endeavored to find these two men not intending to marry to be happy and to forget them and fearing that were these debts of gratitude not discharged they would leave a shadow on his life which promised so brightly for the future it was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behind him and he wished before entering joyously into the future to obtain a quittance from the past that thenardier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact that he had saved colonel pontmercy
2124,thenardier was a ruffian in the eyes of all the world except marius and marius ignorant of the real scene in the battle field of waterloo was not aware of the peculiar detail that his father so far as thenardier was concerned was in the strange position of being indebted to the latter for his life without being indebted to him for any gratitude none of the various agents whom marius employed succeeded in discovering any trace of thenardier obliteration appeared to be complete in that quarter madame thenardier had died in prison pending the trial thenardier and his daughter azelma the only two remaining of that lamentable group had plunged back into the gloom the gulf of the social unknown had silently closed above those beings on the surface there was not visible so much as that quiver that trembling those obscure concentric circles which announce that something has fallen in and that the plummet may be dropped madame thenardier being dead boulatruelle being eliminated from the case claquesous having disappeared the principal persons accused having escaped from prison the trial connected with the ambush in the gorbeau house had come to nothing that affair had remained rather obscure
2125,the bench of assizes had been obliged to content themselves with two subordinates panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille and demi liard alias deux milliards who had been inconsistently condemned after a hearing of both sides of the case to ten years in the galleys hard labor for life had been the sentence pronounced against the escaped and contumacious accomplices thenardier the head and leader had been through contumacy likewise condemned to death this sentence was the only information remaining about thenardier casting upon that buried name its sinister light like a candle beside a bier moreover by thrusting thenardier back into the very remotest depths through a fear of being re captured this sentence added to the density of the shadows which enveloped this man as for the other person as for the unknown man who had saved marius the researches were at first to some extent successful then came to an abrupt conclusion they succeeded in finding the carriage which had brought marius to the rue des filles du calvaire on the evening of the th of june the coachman declared that on the th of june in obedience to the commands of a police agent he had stood
2126,from three o'clock in the afternoon until nightfall on the quai des champs elysees above the outlet of the grand sewer that towards nine o'clock in the evening the grating of the sewer which abuts on the bank of the river had opened that a man had emerged therefrom bearing on his shoulders another man who seemed to be dead that the agent who was on the watch at that point had arrested the living man and had seized the dead man that at the order of the police agent he the coachman had taken all those folks into his carriage that they had first driven to the rue des filles du calvaire that they had there deposited the dead man that the dead man was monsieur marius and that he the coachman recognized him perfectly although he was alive this time that afterwards they had entered the vehicle again that he had whipped up his horses a few paces from the gate of the archives they had called to him to halt that there in the street they had paid him and left him and that the police agent had led the other man away that he knew nothing
2127,more that the night had been very dark marius as we have said recalled nothing he only remembered that he had been seized from behind by an energetic hand at the moment when he was falling backwards into the barricade then everything vanished so far as he was concerned he had only regained consciousness at m gillenormand's he was lost in conjectures he could not doubt his own identity still how had it come to pass that having fallen in the rue de la chanvrerie he had been picked up by the police agent on the banks of the seine near the pont des invalides some one had carried him from the quartier des halles to the champs elysees and how through the sewer unheard of devotion some one who this was the man for whom marius was searching of this man who was his savior nothing not a trace not the faintest indication marius although forced to preserve great reserve in that direction pushed his inquiries as far as the prefecture of police there no more than elsewhere did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment the prefecture knew less about the matter than did the hackney coachman they
2128,had no knowledge of any arrest having been made on the th of june at the mouth of the grand sewer no report of any agent had been received there upon this matter which was regarded at the prefecture as a fable the invention of this fable was attributed to the coachman a coachman who wants a gratuity is capable of anything even of imagination the fact was assured nevertheless and marius could not doubt it unless he doubted his own identity as we have just said everything about this singular enigma was inexplicable what had become of that man that mysterious man whom the coachman had seen emerge from the grating of the grand sewer bearing upon his back the unconscious marius and whom the police agent on the watch had arrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent what had become of the agent himself why had this agent preserved silence had the man succeeded in making his escape had he bribed the agent why did this man give no sign of life to marius who owed everything to him his disinterestedness was no less tremendous than his devotion why had not that man appeared again perhaps
2129,he was above compensation but no one is above gratitude was he dead who was the man what sort of a face had he no one could tell him this the coachman answered the night was very dark basque and nicolette all in a flutter had looked only at their young master all covered with blood the porter whose candle had lighted the tragic arrival of marius had been the only one to take note of the man in question and this is the description that he gave that man was terrible marius had the blood stained clothing which he had worn when he had been brought back to his grandfather preserved in the hope that it would prove of service in his researches on examining the coat it was found that one skirt had been torn in a singular way a piece was missing one evening marius was speaking in the presence of cosette and jean valjean of the whole of that singular adventure of the innumerable inquiries which he had made and of the fruitlessness of his efforts the cold countenance of monsieur fauchelevent angered him he exclaimed with a vivacity which had something of wrath in it
2130,yes that man whoever he may have been was sublime do you know what he did sir he intervened like an archangel he must have flung himself into the midst of the battle have stolen me away have opened the sewer have dragged me into it and have carried me through it he must have traversed more than a league and a half in those frightful subterranean galleries bent over weighed down in the dark in the cess pool more than a league and a half sir with a corpse upon his back and with what object with the sole object of saving the corpse and that corpse i was he said to himself there may still be a glimpse of life there perchance i will risk my own existence for that miserable spark and his existence he risked not once but twenty times and every step was a danger the proof of it is that on emerging from the sewer he was arrested do you know sir that that man did all this and he had no recompense to expect what was i an insurgent what was i one of the conquered oh if cosette's six hundred thousand francs
2131,were mine they are yours interrupted jean valjean well resumed marius i would give them all to find that man once more jean valjean remained silent sixth the sleepless night i the th of february the night of the th to the th of february was a blessed night above its shadows heaven stood open it was the wedding night of marius and cosette the day had been adorable it had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather a fairy spectacle with a confusion of cherubim and cupids over the heads of the bridal pair a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be placed over a door but it had been sweet and smiling the manner of marriage in was not the same as it is to day france had not yet borrowed from england that supreme delicacy of carrying off one's wife of fleeing on coming out of church of hiding oneself with shame from one's happiness and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the song of songs people had not yet grasped to the full the chastity exquisiteness and decency of jolting their paradise in a posting
2132,chaise of breaking up their mystery with clic clacs of taking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn and of leaving behind them in a commonplace chamber at such a night the most sacred of the souvenirs of life mingled pell mell with the tete a tete of the conductor of the diligence and the maid servant of the inn in this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living the mayor and his scarf the priest and his chasuble the law and god no longer suffice they must be eked out by the postilion de lonjumeau a blue waistcoat turned up with red and with bell buttons a plaque like a vantbrace knee breeches of green leather oaths to the norman horses with their tails knotted up false galloons varnished hat long powdered locks an enormous whip and tall boots france does not yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the english nobility and raining down on the post chaise of the bridal pair a hail storm of slippers trodden down at heel and of worn out shoes in memory of churchill afterwards marlborough or malbrouck who was assailed on his
2133,wedding day by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck old shoes and slippers do not as yet form a part of our nuptial celebrations but patience as good taste continues to spread we shall come to that in a hundred years ago marriage was not conducted at a full trot strange to say at that epoch people still imagined that a wedding was a private and social festival that a patriarchal banquet does not spoil a domestic solemnity that gayety even in excess provided it be honest and decent does happiness no harm and that in short it is a good and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence a family is destined to spring should begin at home and that the household should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its witness and people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes the marriage took place therefore in accordance with this now superannuated fashion at m gillenormand's house natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is the banns to publish the papers to be drawn up the mayoralty and the church produce some complication they could not get ready
2134,before the th of february now we note this detail for the pure satisfaction of being exact it chanced that the th fell on shrove tuesday hesitations scruples particularly on the part of aunt gillenormand shrove tuesday exclaimed the grandfather so much the better there is a proverb mariage un mardi gras n'aura point enfants ingrats let us proceed here goes for the th do you want to delay marius no certainly not replied the lover let us marry then cried the grandfather accordingly the marriage took place on the th notwithstanding the public merrymaking it rained that day but there is always in the sky a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness which lovers see even when the rest of creation is under an umbrella on the preceding evening jean valjean handed to marius in the presence of m gillenormand the five hundred and eighty four thousand francs as the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of property the papers had been simple henceforth toussaint was of no use to jean valjean cosette inherited her and promoted her to the rank of lady's maid as for jean valjean a beautiful chamber in the
2135,gillenormand house had been furnished expressly for him and cosette had said to him in such an irresistible manner father i entreat you that she had almost persuaded him to promise that he would come and occupy it a few days before that fixed on for the marriage an accident happened to jean valjean he crushed the thumb of his right hand this was not a serious matter and he had not allowed any one to trouble himself about it nor to dress it nor even to see his hurt not even cosette nevertheless this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage and to carry his arm in a sling and had prevented his signing m gillenormand in his capacity of cosette's supervising guardian had supplied his place we will not conduct the reader either to the mayor's office or to the church one does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent and one is accustomed to turn one's back on the drama as soon as it puts a wedding nosegay in its buttonhole we will confine ourselves to noting an incident which though unnoticed by the wedding party marked the transit from the
2136,rue des filles du calvaire to the church of saint paul at that epoch the northern extremity of the rue saint louis was in process of repaving it was barred off beginning with the rue du pare royal it was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly to saint paul they were obliged to alter their course and the simplest way was to turn through the boulevard one of the invited guests observed that it was shrove tuesday and that there would be a jam of vehicles why asked m gillenormand because of the maskers capital said the grandfather let us go that way these young folks are on the way to be married they are about to enter the serious part of life this will prepare them for seeing a bit of the masquerade they went by way of the boulevard the first wedding coach held cosette and aunt gillenormand m gillenormand and jean valjean marius still separated from his betrothed according to usage did not come until the second the nuptial train on emerging from the rue des filles du calvaire became entangled in a long procession of vehicles which formed an endless chain from the madeleine
2137,to the bastille and from the bastille to the madeleine maskers abounded on the boulevard in spite of the fact that it was raining at intervals merry andrew pantaloon and clown persisted in the good humor of that winter of paris had disguised itself as venice such shrove tuesdays are no longer to be seen now a days everything which exists being a scattered carnival there is no longer any carnival the sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with curious spectators the terraces which crown the peristyles of the theatres were bordered with spectators besides the maskers they stared at that procession peculiar to shrove tuesday as to longchamps of vehicles of every description citadines tapissieres carioles cabriolets marching in order rigorously riveted to each other by the police regulations and locked into rails as it were any one in these vehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle police sergeants maintained on the sides of the boulevard these two interminable parallel files moving in contrary directions and saw to it that nothing interfered with that double current those two brooks of carriages flowing the one down stream the other up stream the one towards the chaussee
2138,d'antin the other towards the faubourg saint antoine the carriages of the peers of france and of the ambassadors emblazoned with coats of arms held the middle of the way going and coming freely certain joyous and magnificent trains notably that of the boeuf gras had the same privilege in this gayety of paris england cracked her whip lord seymour's post chaise harassed by a nickname from the populace passed with great noise in the double file along which the municipal guards galloped like sheep dogs honest family coaches loaded down with great aunts and grandmothers displayed at their doors fresh groups of children in disguise clowns of seven years of age columbines of six ravishing little creatures who felt that they formed an official part of the public mirth who were imbued with the dignity of their harlequinade and who possessed the gravity of functionaries from time to time a hitch arose somewhere in the procession of vehicles one or other of the two lateral files halted until the knot was disentangled one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the whole line then they set out again on the march the wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the
2139,bastille and skirting the right side of the boulevard at the top of the pont aux choux there was a stoppage nearly at the same moment the other file which was proceeding towards the madeleine halted also at that point of the file there was a carriage load of maskers these carriages or to speak more correctly these wagon loads of maskers are very familiar to parisians if they were missing on a shrove tuesday or at the mid lent it would be taken in bad part and people would say there's something behind that probably the ministry is about to undergo a change a pile of cassandras harlequins and columbines jolted along high above the passers by all possible grotesquenesses from the turk to the savage hercules supporting marquises fishwives who would have made rabelais stop up his ears just as the maenads made aristophanes drop his eyes tow wigs pink tights dandified hats spectacles of a grimacer three cornered hats of janot tormented with a butterfly shouts directed at pedestrians fists on hips bold attitudes bare shoulders immodesty unchained a chaos of shamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers this is what that institution was like greece
2140,stood in need of the chariot of thespis france stands in need of the hackney coach of vade everything can be parodied even parody the saturnalia that grimace of antique beauty ends through exaggeration after exaggeration in shrove tuesday and the bacchanal formerly crowned with sprays of vine leaves and grapes inundated with sunshine displaying her marble breast in a divine semi nudity having at the present day lost her shape under the soaked rags of the north has finally come to be called the jack pudding the tradition of carriage loads of maskers runs back to the most ancient days of the monarchy the accounts of louis xi allot to the bailiff of the palace twenty sous tournois for three coaches of mascarades in the cross roads in our day these noisy heaps of creatures are accustomed to have themselves driven in some ancient cuckoo carriage whose imperial they load down or they overwhelm a hired landau with its top thrown back with their tumultuous groups twenty of them ride in a carriage intended for six they cling to the seats to the rumble on the cheeks of the hood on the shafts they even bestride the carriage lamps
2141,they stand sit lie with their knees drawn up in a knot and their legs hanging the women sit on the men's laps far away above the throng of heads their wild pyramid is visible these carriage loads form mountains of mirth in the midst of the rout colle panard and piron flow from it enriched with slang this carriage which has become colossal through its freight has an air of conquest uproar reigns in front tumult behind people vociferate shout howl there they break forth and writhe with enjoyment gayety roars sarcasm flames forth joviality is flaunted like a red flag two jades there drag farce blossomed forth into an apotheosis it is the triumphal car of laughter a laughter that is too cynical to be frank in truth this laughter is suspicious this laughter has a mission it is charged with proving the carnival to the parisians these fishwife vehicles in which one feels one knows not what shadows set the philosopher to thinking there is government therein there one lays one's finger on a mysterious affinity between public men and public women it certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total of gayety
2142,that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should be enticed that the system of spying and serving as caryatids to prostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them that the crowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags half dung half light roll by on four wheels howling and laughing that they should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames that there would be no festival for the populace did not the police promenade in their midst these sorts of twenty headed hydras of joy but what can be done about it these be ribboned and be flowered tumbrils of mire are insulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public the laughter of all is the accomplice of universal degradation certain unhealthy festivals disaggregate the people and convert them into the populace and populaces like tyrants require buffoons the king has roquelaure the populace has the merry andrew paris is a great mad city on every occasion that it is a great sublime city there the carnival forms part of politics paris let us confess it willingly allows infamy to furnish it with comedy she only demands of her masters when

2144,metaphors took place between the maskers and the crowd in the meanwhile two other maskers in the same carriage a spaniard with an enormous nose an elderly air and huge black moustache and a gaunt fishwife who was quite a young girl masked with a loup had also noticed the wedding and while their companions and the passers by were exchanging insults they had held a dialogue in a low voice their aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it the gusts of rain had drenched the front of the vehicle which was wide open the breezes of february are not warm as the fishwife clad in a low necked gown replied to the spaniard she shivered laughed and coughed here is their dialogue say now what daddy do you see that old cove what old cove yonder in the first wedding cart on our side the one with his arm hung up in a black cravat yes well i'm sure that i know him ah i'm willing that they should cut my throat and i'm ready to swear that i never said either you thou or i in my life if i don't know that parisian

2148,from the midst of that whiteness she beamed forth it was an exquisite candor expanding and becoming transfigured in the light one would have pronounced her a virgin on the point of turning into a goddess marius handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed here and there beneath the thick curls pale lines the scars of the barricade were visible the grandfather haughty with head held high amalgamating more than ever in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of barras escorted cosette he took the place of jean valjean who on account of his arm being still in a sling could not give his hand to the bride jean valjean dressed in black followed them with a smile monsieur fauchelevent said the grandfather to him this is a fine day i vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows henceforth there must be no sadness anywhere pardieu i decree joy evil has no right to exist that there should be any unhappy men is in sooth a disgrace to the azure of the sky evil does not come from man who is good at bottom all human miseries have for their capital and central government hell
2149,otherwise known as the devil's tuileries good here i am uttering demagogical words as far as i am concerned i have no longer any political opinions let all me be rich that is to say mirthful and i confine myself to that when at the conclusion of all the ceremonies after having pronounced before the mayor and before the priest all possible yesses after having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy after having exchanged their rings after having knelt side by side under the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer they arrived hand in hand admired and envied by all marius in black she in white preceded by the suisse with the epaulets of a colonel tapping the pavement with his halberd between two rows of astonished spectators at the portals of the church both leaves of which were thrown wide open ready to enter their carriage again and all being finished cosette still could not believe that it was real she looked at marius she looked at the crowd she looked at the sky it seemed as though she feared that she should wake up from her dream her amazed and
2150,uneasy air added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty they entered the same carriage to return home marius beside cosette m gillenormand and jean valjean sat opposite them aunt gillenormand had withdrawn one degree and was in the second vehicle my children said the grandfather here you are monsieur le baron and madame la baronne with an income of thirty thousand livres and cosette nestling close to marius caressed his ear with an angelic whisper so it is true my name is marius i am madame thou these two creatures were resplendent they had reached that irrevocable and irrecoverable moment at the dazzling intersection of all youth and all joy they realized the verses of jean prouvaire they were forty years old taken together it was marriage sublimated these two children were two lilies they did not see each other they did not contemplate each other cosette perceived marius in the midst of a glory marius perceived cosette on an altar and on that altar and in that glory the two apotheoses mingling in the background one knows not how behind a cloud for cosette in a flash for marius there was the ideal thing the real thing the meeting
2151,of the kiss and the dream the nuptial pillow all the torments through which they had passed came back to them in intoxication it seemed to them that their sorrows their sleepless nights their tears their anguish their terrors their despair converted into caresses and rays of light rendered still more charming the charming hour which was approaching and that their griefs were but so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy how good it is to have suffered their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness the long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension it was the same enchantment in two souls tinged with voluptuousness in marius and with modesty in cosette they said to each other in low tones we will go back to take a look at our little garden in the rue plumet the folds of cosette's gown lay across marius such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality one possesses and one supposes one still has time before one to divine the emotion on that day of being at mid day and of dreaming of midnight is indescribable the delights of these two hearts overflowed upon
2152,the crowd and inspired the passers by with cheerfulness people halted in the rue saint antoine in front of saint paul to gaze through the windows of the carriage at the orange flowers quivering on cosette's head then they returned home to the rue des filles du calvaire marius triumphant and radiant mounted side by side with cosette the staircase up which he had been borne in a dying condition the poor who had trooped to the door and who shared their purses blessed them there were flowers everywhere the house was no less fragrant than the church after the incense roses they thought they heard voices carolling in the infinite they had god in their hearts destiny appeared to them like a ceiling of stars above their heads they beheld the light of a rising sun all at once the clock struck marius glanced at cosette's charming bare arm and at the rosy things which were vaguely visible through the lace of her bodice and cosette intercepting marius glance blushed to her very hair quite a number of old family friends of the gillenormand family had been invited they pressed about cosette each one vied with the rest in
2153,saluting her as madame la baronne the officer theodule gillenormand now a captain had come from chartres where he was stationed in garrison to be present at the wedding of his cousin pontmercy cosette did not recognize him he on his side habituated as he was to have women consider him handsome retained no more recollection of cosette than of any other woman how right i was not to believe in that story about the lancer said father gillenormand to himself cosette had never been more tender with jean valjean she was in unison with father gillenormand while he erected joy into aphorisms and maxims she exhaled goodness like a perfume happiness desires that all the world should be happy she regained for the purpose of addressing jean valjean inflections of voice belonging to the time when she was a little girl she caressed him with her smile a banquet had been spread in the dining room illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of a great joy mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy they do not consent to be black the night yes the shadows no if there is no sun one must
2154,be made the dining room was full of gay things in the centre above the white and glittering table was a venetian lustre with flat plates with all sorts of colored birds blue violet red and green perched amid the candles around the chandelier girandoles on the walls sconces with triple and quintuple branches mirrors silverware glassware plate porcelain faience pottery gold and silversmith's work all was sparkling and gay the empty spaces between the candelabra were filled in with bouquets so that where there was not a light there was a flower in the antechamber three violins and a flute softly played quartettes by haydn jean valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing room behind the door the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to nearly conceal him a few moments before they sat down to table cosette came as though inspired by a sudden whim and made him a deep courtesy spreading out her bridal toilet with both hands and with a tenderly roguish glance she asked him father are you satisfied yes said jean valjean i am content well then laugh jean valjean began to laugh a few
2155,moments later basque announced that dinner was served the guests preceded by m gillenormand with cosette on his arm entered the dining room and arranged themselves in the proper order around the table two large arm chairs figured on the right and left of the bride the first for m gillenormand the other for jean valjean m gillenormand took his seat the other arm chair remained empty they looked about for m fauchelevent he was no longer there m gillenormand questioned basque do you know where m fauchelevent is sir replied basque i do precisely m fauchelevent told me to say to you sir that he was suffering his injured hand was paining him somewhat and that he could not dine with monsieur le baron and madame la baronne that he begged to be excused that he would come to morrow he has just taken his departure that empty arm chair chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for a moment but if m fauchelevent was absent m gillenormand was present and the grandfather beamed for two he affirmed that m fauchelevent had done well to retire early if he were suffering but that it was only a slight ailment
2156,this declaration sufficed moreover what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy cosette and marius were passing through one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no other faculty is left to a person than that of receiving happiness and then an idea occurred to m gillenormand pardieu this armchair is empty come hither marius your aunt will permit it although she has a right to you this armchair is for you that is legal and delightful fortunatus beside fortunata applause from the whole table marius took jean valjean's place beside cosette and things fell out so that cosette who had at first been saddened by jean valjean's absence ended by being satisfied with it from the moment when marius took his place and was the substitute cosette would not have regretted god himself she set her sweet little foot shod in white satin on marius foot the arm chair being occupied m fauchelevent was obliterated and nothing was lacking and five minutes afterward the whole table from one end to the other was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness at dessert m gillenormand rising to his feet with a glass of champagne in his hand

2166,had risen and had gained the antechamber unperceived this was the very room which eight months before he had entered black with mud with blood and powder bringing back the grandson to the grandfather the old wainscoting was garlanded with foliage and flowers the musicians were seated on the sofa on which they had laid marius down basque in a black coat knee breeches white stockings and white gloves was arranging roses round all of the dishes that were to be served jean valjean pointed to his arm in its sling charged basque to explain his absence and went away the long windows of the dining room opened on the street jean valjean stood for several minutes erect and motionless in the darkness beneath those radiant windows he listened the confused sounds of the banquet reached his ear he heard the loud commanding tones of the grandfather the violins the clatter of the plates the bursts of laughter and through all that merry uproar he distinguished cosette's sweet and joyous voice he quitted the rue des filles du calvaire and returned to the rue de l'homme arme in order to return thither he took the rue saint louis the rue
2167,culture sainte catherine and the blancs manteaux it was a little longer but it was the road through which for the last three months he had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the rue de l'homme arme to the rue des filles du calvaire in order to avoid the obstructions and the mud in the rue vielle du temple this road through which cosette had passed excluded for him all possibility of any other itinerary jean valjean entered his lodgings he lighted his candle and mounted the stairs the apartment was empty even toussaint was no longer there jean valjean's step made more noise than usual in the chambers all the cupboards stood open he penetrated to cosette's bedroom there were no sheets on the bed the pillow covered with ticking and without a case or lace was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress whose covering was visible and on which no one was ever to sleep again all the little feminine objects which cosette was attached to had been carried away nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the four walls toussaint's bed was despoiled in like manner one
2168,bed only was made up and seemed to be waiting some one and this was jean valjean's bed jean valjean looked at the walls closed some of the cupboard doors and went and came from one room to another then he sought his own chamber once more and set his candle on a table he had disengaged his arm from the sling and he used his right hand as though it did not hurt him he approached his bed and his eyes rested was it by chance was it intentionally on the inseparable of which cosette had been jealous on the little portmanteau which never left him on his arrival in the rue de l'homme arme on the th of june he had deposited it on a round table near the head of his bed he went to this table with a sort of vivacity took a key from his pocket and opened the valise from it he slowly drew forth the garments in which ten years before cosette had quitted montfermeil first the little gown then the black fichu then the stout coarse child's shoes which cosette might almost have worn still so tiny were her feet then the
2169,fustian bodice which was very thick then the knitted petticoat next the apron with pockets then the woollen stockings these stockings which still preserved the graceful form of a tiny leg were no longer than jean valjean's hand all this was black of hue it was he who had brought those garments to montfermeil for her as he removed them from the valise he laid them on the bed he fell to thinking he called up memories it was in winter in a very cold month of december she was shivering half naked in rags her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes he jean valjean had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in these mourning habiliments the mother must have felt pleased in her grave to see her daughter wearing mourning for her and above all to see that she was properly clothed and that she was warm he thought of that forest of montfermeil they had traversed it together cosette and he he thought of what the weather had been of the leafless trees of the wood destitute of birds of the sunless sky it mattered not it was charming he arranged the
2170,tiny garments on the bed the fichu next to the petticoat the stockings beside the shoes and he looked at them one after the other she was no taller than that she had her big doll in her arms she had put her louis d'or in the pocket of that apron she had laughed they walked hand in hand she had no one in the world but him then his venerable white head fell forward on the bed that stoical old heart broke his face was engulfed so to speak in cosette's garments and if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment he would have heard frightful sobs iv the immortal liver the old and formidable struggle of which we have already witnessed so many phases began once more jacob struggled with the angel but one night alas how many times have we beheld jean valjean seized bodily by his conscience in the darkness and struggling desperately against it unheard of conflict at certain moments the foot slips at other moments the ground crumbles away underfoot how many times had that conscience mad for the good clasped and overthrown him how many times had the truth set
2171,her knee inexorably upon his breast how many times hurled to earth by the light had he begged for mercy how many times had that implacable spark lighted within him and upon him by the bishop dazzled him by force when he had wished to be blind how many times had he risen to his feet in the combat held fast to the rock leaning against sophism dragged in the dust now getting the upper hand of his conscience again overthrown by it how many times after an equivoque after the specious and treacherous reasoning of egotism had he heard his irritated conscience cry in his ear a trip you wretch how many times had his refractory thoughts rattled convulsively in his throat under the evidence of duty resistance to god funereal sweats what secret wounds which he alone felt bleed what excoriations in his lamentable existence how many times he had risen bleeding bruised broken enlightened despair in his heart serenity in his soul and vanquished he had felt himself the conqueror and after having dislocated broken and rent his conscience with red hot pincers it had said to him as it stood over him formidable luminous and tranquil
2172,now go in peace but on emerging from so melancholy a conflict what a lugubrious peace alas nevertheless that night jean valjean felt that he was passing through his final combat a heart rending question presented itself predestinations are not all direct they do not open out in a straight avenue before the predestined man they have blind courts impassable alleys obscure turns disturbing crossroads offering the choice of many ways jean valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous of these crossroads he had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil he had that gloomy intersection beneath his eyes on this occasion once more as had happened to him already in other sad vicissitudes two roads opened out before him the one tempting the other alarming which was he to take he was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious index finger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness once more jean valjean had the choice between the terrible port and the smiling ambush is it then true the soul may recover but not fate frightful thing an incurable destiny this is the problem which presented itself
2173,to him in what manner was jean valjean to behave in relation to the happiness of cosette and marius it was he who had willed that happiness it was he who had brought it about he had himself buried it in his entrails and at that moment when he reflected on it he was able to enjoy the sort of satisfaction which an armorer would experience on recognizing his factory mark on a knife on withdrawing it all smoking from his own breast cosette had marius marius possessed cosette they had everything even riches and this was his doing but what was he jean valjean to do with this happiness now that it existed now that it was there should he force himself on this happiness should he treat it as belonging to him no doubt cosette did belong to another but should he jean valjean retain of cosette all that he could retain should he remain the sort of father half seen but respected which he had hitherto been should he without saying a word bring his past to that future should he present himself there as though he had a right and should he seat himself veiled at
2174,that luminous fireside should he take those innocent hands into his tragic hands with a smile should he place upon the peaceful fender of the gillenormand drawing room those feet of his which dragged behind them the disgraceful shadow of the law should he enter into participation in the fair fortunes of cosette and marius should he render the obscurity on his brow and the cloud upon theirs still more dense should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity should he continue to hold his peace in a word should he be the sinister mute of destiny beside these two happy beings we must have become habituated to fatality and to encounters with it in order to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions appear to us in all their horrible nakedness good or evil stands behind this severe interrogation point what are you going to do demands the sphinx this habit of trial jean valjean possessed he gazed intently at the sphinx he examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects cosette that charming existence was the raft of this shipwreck what was he to do to cling fast to it or
2175,to let go his hold if he clung to it he should emerge from disaster he should ascend again into the sunlight he should let the bitter water drip from his garments and his hair he was saved he should live and if he let go his hold then the abyss thus he took sad council with his thoughts or to speak more correctly he fought he kicked furiously internally now against his will now against his conviction happily for jean valjean that he had been able to weep that relieved him possibly but the beginning was savage a tempest more furious than the one which had formerly driven him to arras broke loose within him the past surged up before him facing the present he compared them and sobbed the silence of tears once opened the despairing man writhed he felt that he had been stopped short alas in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty when we thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal bewildered furious exasperated at having to yield disputing the ground hoping for a possible flight seeking an escape what an abrupt and sinister resistance does the foot of
2176,the wall offer in our rear to feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle the invisible inexorable what an obsession then one is never done with conscience make your choice brutus make your choice cato it is fathomless since it is god one flings into that well the labor of one's whole life one flings in one's fortune one flings in one's riches one flings in one's success one flings in one's liberty or fatherland one flings in one's well being one flings in one's repose one flings in one's joy more more more empty the vase tip the urn one must finish by flinging in one's heart somewhere in the fog of the ancient hells there is a tun like that is not one pardonable if one at last refuses can the inexhaustible have any right are not chains which are endless above human strength who would blame sisyphus and jean valjean for saying it is enough the obedience of matter is limited by friction is there no limit to the obedience of the soul if perpetual motion is impossible can perpetual self sacrifice be exacted the first step is nothing it is the last which is difficult
2177,what was the champmathieu affair in comparison with cosette's marriage and of that which it entailed what is a re entrance into the galleys compared to entrance into the void oh first step that must be descended how sombre art thou oh second step how black art thou how could he refrain from turning aside his head this time martyrdom is sublimation corrosive sublimation it is a torture which consecrates one can consent to it for the first hour one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron one places on one's head the crown of hot iron one accepts the globe of red hot iron one takes the sceptre of red hot iron but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicates from suffering at length jean valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion he weighed he reflected he considered the alternatives the mysterious balance of light and darkness should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself on one side lay the sacrifice of cosette on the other that of himself at
2178,what solution should he arrive what decision did he come to what resolution did he take what was his own inward definitive response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality what door did he decide to open which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him which was his choice what extremity did he accept to which of the gulfs did he nod his head his dizzy revery lasted all night long he remained there until daylight in the same attitude bent double over that bed prostrate beneath the enormity of fate crushed perchance alas with clenched fists with arms outspread at right angles like a man crucified who has been un nailed and flung face down on the earth there he remained for twelve hours the twelve long hours of a long winter's night ice cold without once raising his head and without uttering a word he was as motionless as a corpse while his thoughts wallowed on the earth and soared now like the hydra now like the eagle any one to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced him dead all at once he shuddered convulsively and
2179,his mouth glued to cosette's garments kissed them then it could be seen that he was alive who could see since jean valjean was alone and there was no one there the one who is in the shadows seventh the last draught from the cup i the seventh circle and the eighth heaven the days that follow weddings are solitary people respect the meditations of the happy pair and also their tardy slumbers to some degree the tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on on the morning of the th of february it was a little past midday when basque with napkin and feather duster under his arm busy in setting his antechamber to rights heard a light tap at the door there had been no ring which was discreet on such a day basque opened the door and beheld m fauchelevent he introduced him into the drawing room still encumbered and topsy turvy and which bore the air of a field of battle after the joys of the preceding evening dame sir remarked basque we all woke up late is your master up asked jean valjean how is monsieur's arm replied basque better is your master up
2180,which one the old one or the new one monsieur pontmercy monsieur le baron said basque drawing himself up a man is a baron most of all to his servants he counts for something with them they are what a philosopher would call bespattered with the title and that flatters them marius be it said in passing a militant republican as he had proved was now a baron in spite of himself a small revolution had taken place in the family in connection with this title it was now m gillenormand who clung to it and marius who detached himself from it but colonel pontmercy had written my son will bear my title marius obeyed and then cosette in whom the woman was beginning to dawn was delighted to be a baroness monsieur le baron repeated basque i will go and see i will tell him that m fauchelevent is here no do not tell him that it is i tell him that some one wishes to speak to him in private and mention no name ah ejaculated basque i wish to surprise him ah ejaculated basque once more emitting his second ah as an explanation of the first and
2181,he left the room jean valjean remained alone the drawing room as we have just said was in great disorder it seemed as though by lending an air one might still hear the vague noise of the wedding on the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which had fallen from garlands and head dresses the wax candles burned to stumps added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the chandeliers not a single piece of furniture was in its place in the corners three or four arm chairs drawn close together in a circle had the appearance of continuing a conversation the whole effect was cheerful a certain grace still lingers round a dead feast it has been a happy thing on the chairs in disarray among those fading flowers beneath those extinct lights people have thought of joy the sun had succeeded to the chandelier and made its way gayly into the drawing room several minutes elapsed jean valjean stood motionless on the spot where basque had left him he was very pale his eyes were hollow and so sunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in their orbits his black coat bore the
2182,weary folds of a garment that has been up all night the elbows were whitened with the down which the friction of cloth against linen leaves behind it jean valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at his feet by the sun there came a sound at the door and he raised his eyes marius entered his head well up his mouth smiling an indescribable light on his countenance his brow expanded his eyes triumphant he had not slept either it is you father he exclaimed on catching sight of jean valjean that idiot of a basque had such a mysterious air but you have come too early it is only half past twelve cosette is asleep that word father said to m fauchelevent by marius signified supreme felicity there had always existed as the reader knows a lofty wall a coldness and a constraint between them ice which must be broken or melted marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall was lowered when the ice dissolved and when m fauchelevent was to him as to cosette a father he continued his words poured forth as is the peculiarity of divine paroxysms of joy
2183,how glad i am to see you if you only knew how we missed you yesterday good morning father how is your hand better is it not and satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself he pursued we have both been talking about you cosette loves you so dearly you must not forget that you have a chamber here we want nothing more to do with the rue de l'homme arme we will have no more of it at all how could you go to live in a street like that which is sickly which is disagreeable which is ugly which has a barrier at one end where one is cold and into which one cannot enter you are to come and install yourself here and this very day or you will have to deal with cosette she means to lead us all by the nose i warn you you have your own chamber here it is close to ours it opens on the garden the trouble with the clock has been attended to the bed is made it is all ready you have only to take possession of it near your bed cosette has placed
2184,a huge old easy chair covered with utrecht velvet and she has said to it stretch out your arms to him a nightingale comes to the clump of acacias opposite your windows every spring in two months more you will have it you will have its nest on your left and ours on your right by night it will sing and by day cosette will prattle your chamber faces due south cosette will arrange your books for you your voyages of captain cook and the other vancouver's and all your affairs i believe that there is a little valise to which you are attached i have fixed upon a corner of honor for that you have conquered my grandfather you suit him we will live together do you play whist you will overwhelm my grandfather with delight if you play whist it is you who shall take cosette to walk on the days when i am at the courts you shall give her your arm you know as you used to in the luxembourg we are absolutely resolved to be happy and you shall be included in it in our happiness do you hear father come will you breakfast with
2185,us to day sir said jean valjean i have something to say to you i am an ex convict the limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped as well in the case of the mind as in that of the ear these words i am an ex convict proceeding from the mouth of m fauchelevent and entering the ear of marius overshot the possible it seemed to him that something had just been said to him but he did not know what he stood with his mouth wide open then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state he had not up to that moment observed the other man's terrible pallor jean valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm unrolled the linen from around his hand bared his thumb and showed it to marius there is nothing the matter with my hand said he marius looked at the thumb there has not been anything the matter with it went on jean valjean there was in fact no trace of any injury jean valjean continued it was fitting that i should be absent from your marriage i
2186,absented myself as much as was in my power so i invented this injury in order that i might not commit a forgery that i might not introduce a flaw into the marriage documents in order that i might escape from signing marius stammered what is the meaning of this the meaning of it is replied jean valjean that i have been in the galleys you are driving me mad exclaimed marius in terror monsieur pontmercy said jean valjean i was nineteen years in the galleys for theft then i was condemned for life for theft for a second offence at the present moment i have broken my ban in vain did marius recoil before the reality refuse the fact resist the evidence he was forced to give way he began to understand and as always happens in such cases he understood too much an inward shudder of hideous enlightenment flashed through him an idea which made him quiver traversed his mind he caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for himself in the future say all say all he cried you are cosette's father and he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable horror jean valjean
2187,elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he seemed to grow even to the ceiling it is necessary that you should believe me here sir although our oath to others may not be received in law here he paused then with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority he added articulating slowly and emphasizing the syllables you will believe me i the father of cosette before god no monsieur le baron pontmercy i am a peasant of faverolles i earned my living by pruning trees my name is not fauchelevent but jean valjean i am not related to cosette reassure yourself marius stammered who will prove that to me i since i tell you so marius looked at the man he was melancholy yet tranquil no lie could proceed from such a calm that which is icy is sincere the truth could be felt in that chill of the tomb i believe you said marius jean valjean bent his head as though taking note of this and continued what am i to cosette a passer by ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence i love her it is true one loves a
2188,child whom one has seen when very young being old oneself when one is old one feels oneself a grandfather towards all little children you may it seems to me suppose that i have something which resembles a heart she was an orphan without either father or mother she needed me that is why i began to love her children are so weak that the first comer even a man like me can become their protector i have fulfilled this duty towards cosette i do not think that so slight a thing can be called a good action but if it be a good action well say that i have done it register this attenuating circumstance to day cosette passes out of my life our two roads part henceforth i can do nothing for her she is madame pontmercy her providence has changed and cosette gains by the change all is well as for the six hundred thousand francs you do not mention them to me but i forestall your thought they are a deposit how did that deposit come into my hands what does that matter i restore the deposit nothing more can be demanded of me i complete
2189,the restitution by announcing my true name that concerns me i have a reason for desiring that you should know who i am and jean valjean looked marius full in the face all that marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent certain gusts of destiny produce these billows in our souls we have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us is dispersed we say the first things that occur to us which are not always precisely those which should be said there are sudden revelations which one cannot bear and which intoxicate like baleful wine marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented itself to him to the point of addressing that man almost like a person who was angry with him for this avowal but why he exclaimed do you tell me all this who forces you to do so you could have kept your secret to yourself you are neither denounced nor tracked nor pursued you have a reason for wantonly making such a revelation conclude there is something more in what connection do you make this confession what is your motive my motive replied jean valjean in a voice so low and dull that
2190,one would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to marius from what motive in fact has this convict just said i am a convict well yes the motive is strange it is out of honesty stay the unfortunate point is that i have a thread in my heart which keeps me fast it is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly solid all life falls in ruin around one one resists had i been able to tear out that thread to break it to undo the knot or to cut it to go far away i should have been safe i had only to go away there are diligences in the rue bouloy you are happy i am going i have tried to break that thread i have jerked at it it would not break i tore my heart with it then i said i cannot live anywhere else than here i must stay well yes you are right i am a fool why not simply remain here you offer me a chamber in this house madame pontmercy is sincerely attached to me she said to the arm chair stretch out your
2191,arms to him your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me i suit him we shall live together and take our meals in common i shall give cosette my arm madame pontmercy excuse me it is a habit we shall have but one roof one table one fire the same chimney corner in winter the same promenade in summer that is joy that is happiness that is everything we shall live as one family one family at that word jean valjean became wild he folded his arms glared at the floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss therein and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones as one family no i belong to no family i do not belong to yours i do not belong to any family of men in houses where people are among themselves i am superfluous there are families but there is nothing of the sort for me i am an unlucky wretch i am left outside did i have a father and mother i almost doubt it on the day when i gave that child in marriage all came to an end i have seen her happy and that
2192,she is with a man whom she loves and that there exists here a kind old man a household of two angels and all joys in that house and that it was well i said to myself enter thou not i could have lied it is true have deceived you all and remained monsieur fauchelevent so long as it was for her i could lie but now it would be for myself and i must not it was sufficient for me to hold my peace it is true and all would go on you ask me what has forced me to speak a very odd thing my conscience to hold my peace was very easy however i passed the night in trying to persuade myself to it you questioned me and what i have just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to do it well yes i have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself and i gave myself very good reasons i have done what i could but there are two things in which i have not succeeded in breaking the thread that holds me fixed riveted and sealed here by the heart
2193,or in silencing some one who speaks softly to me when i am alone that is why i have come hither to tell you everything this morning everything or nearly everything it is useless to tell you that which concerns only myself i keep that to myself you know the essential points so i have taken my mystery and have brought it to you and i have disembowelled my secret before your eyes it was not a resolution that was easy to take i struggled all night long ah you think that i did not tell myself that this was no champmathieu affair that by concealing my name i was doing no one any injury that the name of fauchelevent had been given to me by fauchelevent himself out of gratitude for a service rendered to him and that i might assuredly keep it and that i should be happy in that chamber which you offer me that i should not be in any one's way that i should be in my own little corner and that while you would have cosette i should have the idea that i was in the same house with her each one of us
2194,would have had his share of happiness if i continued to be monsieur fauchelevent that would arrange everything yes with the exception of my soul there was joy everywhere upon my surface but the bottom of my soul remained black it is not enough to be happy one must be content thus i should have remained monsieur fauchelevent thus i should have concealed my true visage thus in the presence of your expansion i should have had an enigma thus in the midst of your full noonday i should have had shadows thus without crying ware i should have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside i should have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who i was you would drive me from it i should have allowed myself to be served by domestics who had they known would have said how horrible i should have touched you with my elbow which you have a right to dislike i should have filched your clasps of the hand there would have existed in your house a division of respect between venerable white locks and tainted white locks at your most intimate hours when all
2195,hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest when we four were together your grandfather you two and myself a stranger would have been present i should have been side by side with you in your existence having for my only care not to disarrange the cover of my dreadful pit thus i a dead man should have thrust myself upon you who are living beings i should have condemned her to myself forever you and cosette and i would have had all three of our heads in the green cap does it not make you shudder i am only the most crushed of men i should have been the most monstrous of men and i should have committed that crime every day and i should have had that face of night upon my visage every day every day and i should have communicated to you a share in my taint every day every day to you my dearly beloved my children to you my innocent creatures is it nothing to hold one's peace is it a simple matter to keep silence no it is not simple there is a silence which lies and my lie
2196,and my fraud and my indignity and my cowardice and my treason and my crime i should have drained drop by drop i should have spit it out then swallowed it again i should have finished at midnight and have begun again at midday and my good morning would have lied and my good night would have lied and i should have slept on it i should have eaten it with my bread and i should have looked cosette in the face and i should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned soul and i should have been an abominable villain why should i do it in order to be happy in order to be happy have i the right to be happy i stand outside of life sir jean valjean paused marius listened such chains of ideas and of anguishes cannot be interrupted jean valjean lowered his voice once more but it was no longer a dull voice it was a sinister voice you ask why i speak i am neither denounced nor pursued nor tracked you say yes i am denounced yes i am tracked by whom by myself it is
2197,i who bar the passage to myself and i drag myself and i push myself and i arrest myself and i execute myself and when one holds oneself one is firmly held and seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck and extending it towards marius do you see that fist he continued don't you think that it holds that collar in such a wise as not to release it well conscience is another grasp if one desires to be happy sir one must never understand duty for as soon as one has comprehended it it is implacable one would say that it punished you for comprehending it but no it rewards you for it places you in a hell where you feel god beside you one has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is at peace with himself and with a poignant accent he added monsieur pontmercy this is not common sense i am an honest man it is by degrading myself in your eyes that i elevate myself in my own this has happened to me once before but it was less painful then it was a mere nothing yes an
2198,honest man i should not be so if through my fault you had continued to esteem me now that you despise me i am so i have that fatality hanging over me that not being able to ever have anything but stolen consideration that consideration humiliates me and crushes me inwardly and in order that i may respect myself it is necessary that i should be despised then i straighten up again i am a galley slave who obeys his conscience i know well that that is most improbable but what would you have me do about it it is the fact i have entered into engagements with myself i keep them there are encounters which bind us there are chances which involve us in duties you see monsieur pontmercy various things have happened to me in the course of my life again jean valjean paused swallowing his saliva with an effort as though his words had a bitter after taste and then he went on when one has such a horror hanging over one one has not the right to make others share it without their knowledge one has not the right to make them slip over one's own
2199,precipice without their perceiving it one has not the right to let one's red blouse drag upon them one has no right to slyly encumber with one's misery the happiness of others it is hideous to approach those who are healthy and to touch them in the dark with one's ulcer in spite of the fact that fauchelevent lent me his name i have no right to use it he could give it to me but i could not take it a name is an i you see sir that i have thought somewhat i have read a little although i am a peasant and you see that i express myself properly i understand things i have procured myself an education well yes to abstract a name and to place oneself under it is dishonest letters of the alphabet can be filched like a purse or a watch to be a false signature in flesh and blood to be a living false key to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock never more to look straightforward to forever eye askance to be infamous within the i no no no no no it is better to suffer to
2200,bleed to weep to tear one's skin from the flesh with one's nails to pass nights writhing in anguish to devour oneself body and soul that is why i have just told you all this wantonly as you say he drew a painful breath and hurled this final word in days gone by i stole a loaf of bread in order to live to day in order to live i will not steal a name to live interrupted marius you do not need that name in order to live ah i understand the matter said jean valjean raising and lowering his head several times in succession a silence ensued both held their peace each plunged in a gulf of thoughts marius was sitting near a table and resting the corner of his mouth on one of his fingers which was folded back jean valjean was pacing to and fro he paused before a mirror and remained motionless then as though replying to some inward course of reasoning he said as he gazed at the mirror which he did not see while at present i am relieved he took up his march again and walked to the other end of the
2201,drawing room at the moment when he turned round he perceived that marius was watching his walk then he said with an inexpressible intonation i drag my leg a little now you understand why then he turned fully round towards marius and now sir imagine this i have said nothing i have remained monsieur fauchelevent i have taken my place in your house i am one of you i am in my chamber i come to breakfast in the morning in slippers in the evening all three of us go to the play i accompany madame pontmercy to the tuileries and to the place royale we are together you think me your equal one fine day you are there and i am there we are conversing we are laughing all at once you hear a voice shouting this name jean valjean and behold that terrible hand the police darts from the darkness and abruptly tears off my mask again he paused marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder jean valjean resumed what do you say to that marius silence answered for him jean valjean continued you see that i am right in not holding my peace be happy
2202,be in heaven be the angel of an angel exist in the sun be content therewith and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poor damned wretch takes to open his breast and force his duty to come forth you have before you sir a wretched man marius slowly crossed the room and when he was quite close to jean valjean he offered the latter his hand but marius was obliged to step up and take that hand which was not offered jean valjean let him have his own way and it seemed to marius that he pressed a hand of marble my grandfather has friends said marius i will procure your pardon it is useless replied jean valjean i am believed to be dead and that suffices the dead are not subjected to surveillance they are supposed to rot in peace death is the same thing as pardon and disengaging the hand which marius held he added with a sort of inexorable dignity moreover the friend to whom i have recourse is the doing of my duty and i need but one pardon that of my conscience at that moment a door at the other end of
2203,the drawing room opened gently half way and in the opening cosette's head appeared they saw only her sweet face her hair was in charming disorder her eyelids were still swollen with sleep she made the movement of a bird which thrusts its head out of its nest glanced first at her husband then at jean valjean and cried to them with a smile so that they seemed to behold a smile at the heart of a rose i will wager that you are talking politics how stupid that is instead of being with me jean valjean shuddered cosette stammered marius and he paused one would have said that they were two criminals cosette who was radiant continued to gaze at both of them there was something in her eyes like gleams of paradise i have caught you in the very act said cosette just now i heard my father fauchelevent through the door saying conscience doing my duty that is politics indeed it is i will not have it people should not talk politics the very next day it is not right you are mistaken cosette said marius we are talking business we are discussing the best investment of
2204,your six hundred thousand francs that is not it at all interrupted cosette i am coming does any body want me here and passing resolutely through the door she entered the drawing room she was dressed in a voluminous white dressing gown with a thousand folds and large sleeves which starting from the neck fell to her feet in the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures there are these charming sacks fit to clothe the angels she contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror then exclaimed in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy there was once a king and a queen oh how happy i am that said she made a curtsey to marius and to jean valjean there said she i am going to install myself near you in an easy chair we breakfast in half an hour you shall say anything you like i know well that men must talk and i will be very good marius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her we are talking business by the way said cosette i have opened my window a flock of pierrots has arrived in the garden birds not maskers to day
2205,is ash wednesday but not for the birds i tell you that we are talking business go my little cosette leave us alone for a moment we are talking figures that will bore you you have a charming cravat on this morning marius you are very dandified monseigneur no it will not bore me i assure you that it will bore you no since it is you i shall not understand you but i shall listen to you when one hears the voices of those whom one loves one does not need to understand the words that they utter that we should be here together that is all that i desire i shall remain with you bah you are my beloved cosette impossible impossible yes very good said cosette i was going to tell you some news i could have told you that your grandfather is still asleep that your aunt is at mass that the chimney in my father fauchelevent's room smokes that nicolette has sent for the chimney sweep that toussaint and nicolette have already quarrelled that nicolette makes sport of toussaint's stammer well you shall know nothing ah it is impossible you shall see gentlemen that i
2206,in my turn can say it is impossible then who will be caught i beseech you my little marius let me stay here with you two i swear to you that it is indispensable that we should be alone well am i anybody jean valjean had not uttered a single word cosette turned to him in the first place father i want you to come and embrace me what do you mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part who gave me such a father as that you must perceive that my family life is very unhappy my husband beats me come embrace me instantly jean valjean approached cosette turned toward marius as for you i shall make a face at you then she presented her brow to jean valjean jean valjean advanced a step toward her cosette recoiled father you are pale does your arm hurt you it is well said jean valjean did you sleep badly no are you sad no embrace me if you are well if you sleep well if you are content i will not scold you and again she offered him her brow jean valjean dropped a kiss upon that brow whereon
2207,rested a celestial gleam smile jean valjean obeyed it was the smile of a spectre now defend me against my husband cosette ejaculated marius get angry father say that i must stay you can certainly talk before me so you think me very silly what you say is astonishing business placing money in a bank a great matter truly men make mysteries out of nothing i am very pretty this morning look at me marius and with an adorable shrug of the shoulders and an indescribably exquisite pout she glanced at marius i love you said marius i adore you said cosette and they fell irresistibly into each other's arms now said cosette adjusting a fold of her dressing gown with a triumphant little grimace i shall stay no not that said marius in a supplicating tone we have to finish something still no marius assumed a grave tone i assure you cosette that it is impossible ah you put on your man's voice sir that is well i go you father have not upheld me monsieur my father monsieur my husband you are tyrants i shall go and tell grandpapa if you think that i am going to return
2208,and talk platitudes to you you are mistaken i am proud i shall wait for you now you shall see that it is you who are going to be bored without me i am going it is well and she left the room two seconds later the door opened once more her fresh and rosy head was again thrust between the two leaves and she cried to them i am very angry indeed the door closed again and the shadows descended once more it was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the night without itself being conscious of it marius made sure that the door was securely closed poor cosette he murmured when she finds out at that word jean valjean trembled in every limb he fixed on marius a bewildered eye cosette oh yes it is true you are going to tell cosette about this that is right stay i had not thought of that one has the strength for one thing but not for another sir i conjure you i entreat now sir give me your most sacred word of honor that you will not tell her is it not enough that you should
2209,know it i have been able to say it myself without being forced to it i could have told it to the universe to the whole world it was all one to me but she she does not know what it is it would terrify her what a convict we should be obliged to explain matters to her to say to her he is a man who has been in the galleys she saw the chain gang pass by one day oh my god he dropped into an arm chair and hid his face in his hands his grief was not audible but from the quivering of his shoulders it was evident that he was weeping silent tears terrible tears there is something of suffocation in the sob he was seized with a sort of convulsion he threw himself against the back of the chair as though to gain breath letting his arms fall and allowing marius to see his face inundated with tears and marius heard him murmur so low that his voice seemed to issue from fathomless depths oh would that i could die be at your ease said marius i will keep your secret for myself alone
2210,and less touched perhaps than he ought to have been but forced for the last hour to familiarize himself with something as unexpected as it was dreadful gradually beholding the convict superposed before his very eyes upon m fauchelevent overcome little by little by that lugubrious reality and led by the natural inclination of the situation to recognize the space which had just been placed between that man and himself marius added it is impossible that i should not speak a word to you with regard to the deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted that is an act of probity it is just that some recompense should be bestowed on you fix the sum yourself it shall be counted out to you do not fear to set it very high i thank you sir replied jean valjean gently he remained in thought for a moment mechanically passing the tip of his fore finger across his thumb nail then he lifted up his voice all is nearly over but one last thing remains for me what is it jean valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation and without voice without breath he stammered rather than said now
2211,that you know do you think sir you who are the master that i ought not to see cosette any more i think that would be better replied marius coldly i shall never see her more murmured jean valjean and he directed his steps towards the door he laid his hand on the knob the latch yielded the door opened jean valjean pushed it open far enough to pass through stood motionless for a second then closed the door again and turned to marius he was no longer pale he was livid there were no longer any tears in his eyes but only a sort of tragic flame his voice had regained a strange composure stay sir he said if you will allow it i will come to see her i assure you that i desire it greatly if i had not cared to see cosette i should not have made to you the confession that i have made i should have gone away but as i desired to remain in the place where cosette is and to continue to see her i had to tell you about it honestly you follow my reasoning do you not it is a
2212,matter easily understood you see i have had her with me for more than nine years we lived first in that hut on the boulevard then in the convent then near the luxembourg that was where you saw her for the first time you remember her blue plush hat then we went to the quartier des invalides where there was a railing on a garden the rue plumet i lived in a little back court yard whence i could hear her piano that was my life we never left each other that lasted for nine years and some months i was like her own father and she was my child i do not know whether you understand monsieur pontmercy but to go away now never to see her again never to speak to her again to no longer have anything would be hard if you do not disapprove of it i will come to see cosette from time to time i will not come often i will not remain long you shall give orders that i am to be received in the little waiting room on the ground floor i could enter perfectly well by the back door but that
2213,might create surprise perhaps and it would be better i think for me to enter by the usual door truly sir i should like to see a little more of cosette as rarely as you please put yourself in my place i have nothing left but that and then we must be cautious if i no longer come at all it would produce a bad effect it would be considered singular what i can do by the way is to come in the afternoon when night is beginning to fall you shall come every evening said marius and cosette will be waiting for you you are kind sir said jean valjean marius saluted jean valjean happiness escorted despair to the door and these two men parted ii the obscurities which a revelation can contain marius was quite upset the sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside whom he had seen cosette was now explained to him there was something enigmatic about that person of which his instinct had warned him this enigma was the most hideous of disgraces the galleys this m fauchelevent was the convict jean valjean to abruptly find such a secret in
2214,the midst of one's happiness resembles the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves was the happiness of marius and cosette thenceforth condemned to such a neighborhood was this an accomplished fact did the acceptance of that man form a part of the marriage now consummated was there nothing to be done had marius wedded the convict as well in vain may one be crowned with light and joy in vain may one taste the grand purple hour of life happy love such shocks would force even the archangel in his ecstasy even the demigod in his glory to shudder as is always the case in changes of view of this nature marius asked himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself had he been wanting in divination had he been wanting in prudence had he involuntarily dulled his wits a little perhaps had he entered upon this love affair which had ended in his marriage to cosette without taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings he admitted it is thus by a series of successive admissions of ourselves in regard to ourselves that life amends us little by little he admitted the chimerical
2215,and visionary side of his nature a sort of internal cloud peculiar to many organizations and which in paroxysms of passion and sorrow dilates as the temperature of the soul changes and invades the entire man to such a degree as to render him nothing more than a conscience bathed in a mist we have more than once indicated this characteristic element of marius individuality he recalled that in the intoxication of his love in the rue plumet during those six or seven ecstatic weeks he had not even spoke to cosette of that drama in the gorbeau hovel where the victim had taken up such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing flight how had it happened that he had not mentioned this to cosette yet it was so near and so terrible how had it come to pass that he had not even named the thenardiers and particularly on the day when he had encountered eponine he now found it almost difficult to explain his silence of that time nevertheless he could account for it he recalled his benumbed state his intoxication with cosette love absorbing everything that catching away of each other into
2216,the ideal and perhaps also like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charming state of the soul a vague dull instinct impelling him to conceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure contact with which he dreaded in which he did not wish to play any part his agency in which he had kept secret and in which he could be neither narrator nor witness without being an accuser moreover these few weeks had been a flash of lightning there had been no time for anything except love in short having weighed everything turned everything over in his mind examined everything whatever might have been the consequences if he had told cosette about the gorbeau ambush even if he had discovered that jean valjean was a convict would that have changed him marius would that have changed her cosette would he have drawn back would he have adored her any the less would he have refrained from marrying her no then there was nothing to regret nothing with which he need reproach himself all was well there is a deity for those drunken men who are called lovers marius blind had followed the path which
2217,he would have chosen had he been in full possession of his sight love had bandaged his eyes in order to lead him whither to paradise but this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal accompaniment marius ancient estrangement towards this man towards this fauchelevent who had turned into jean valjean was at present mingled with horror in this horror let us state there was some pity and even a certain surprise this thief this thief guilty of a second offence had restored that deposit and what a deposit six hundred thousand francs he alone was in the secret of that deposit he might have kept it all he had restored it all moreover he had himself revealed his situation nothing forced him to this if any one learned who he was it was through himself in this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation there was acceptance of peril for a condemned man a mask is not a mask it is a shelter a false name is security and he had rejected that false name he the galley slave might have hidden himself forever in an honest family he had withstood this temptation and with what motive
2218,through a conscientious scruple he himself explained this with the irresistible accents of truth in short whatever this jean valjean might be he was undoubtedly a conscience which was awakening there existed some mysterious re habilitation which had begun and to all appearances scruples had for a long time already controlled this man such fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar natures an awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul jean valjean was sincere this sincerity visible palpable irrefragable evident from the very grief that it caused him rendered inquiries useless and conferred authority on all that that man had said here for marius there was a strange reversal of situations what breathed from m fauchelevent distrust what did jean valjean inspire confidence in the mysterious balance of this jean valjean which the pensive marius struck he admitted the active principle he admitted the passive principle and he tried to reach a balance but all this went on as in a storm marius while endeavoring to form a clear idea of this man and while pursuing jean valjean so to speak in the depths of his thought lost him and found him again in a fatal mist
2219,the deposit honestly restored the probity of the confession these were good this produced a lightening of the cloud then the cloud became black once more troubled as were marius memories a shadow of them returned to him after all what was that adventure in the jondrette attic why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police instead of entering a complaint here marius found the answer because that man was a fugitive from justice who had broken his ban another question why had that man come to the barricade for marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which had re appeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of heat this man had been in the barricade he had not fought there what had he come there for in the presence of this question a spectre sprang up and replied javert marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of jean valjean dragging the pinioned javert out of the barricade and he still heard behind the corner of the little rue mondetour that frightful pistol shot obviously there was hatred between that police spy and the galley slave the one was in the
2220,other's way jean valjean had gone to the barricade for the purpose of revenging himself he had arrived late he probably knew that javert was a prisoner there the corsican vendetta has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law there it is so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but half turned towards good and those hearts are so constituted that a criminal who is in the path of repentance may be scrupulous in the matter of theft and unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance jean valjean had killed javert at least that seemed to be evident this was the final question to be sure but to this there was no reply this question marius felt like pincers how had it come to pass that jean valjean's existence had elbowed that of cosette for so long a period what melancholy sport of providence was that which had placed that child in contact with that man are there then chains for two which are forged on high and does god take pleasure in coupling the angel with the demon so a crime and an innocence can be room mates in the mysterious galleys of wretchedness
2221,in that defiling of condemned persons which is called human destiny can two brows pass side by side the one ingenuous the other formidable the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn the other forever blemished by the flash of an eternal lightning who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing off in what manner in consequence of what prodigy had any community of life been established between this celestial little creature and that old criminal who could have bound the lamb to the wolf and what was still more incomprehensible have attached the wolf to the lamb for the wolf loved the lamb for the fierce creature adored the feeble one for during the space of nine years the angel had had the monster as her point of support cosette's childhood and girlhood her advent in the daylight her virginal growth towards life and light had been sheltered by that hideous devotion here questions exfoliated so to speak into innumerable enigmas abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses and marius could no longer bend over jean valjean without becoming dizzy what was this man precipice the old symbols of genesis are eternal in human society such as it
2222,now exists and until a broader day shall effect a change in it there will always be two men the one superior the other subterranean the one which is according to good is abel the other which is according to evil is cain what was this tender cain what was this ruffian religiously absorbed in the adoration of a virgin watching over her rearing her guarding her dignifying her and enveloping her impure as he was himself with purity what was that cess pool which had venerated that innocence to such a point as not to leave upon it a single spot what was this jean valjean educating cosette what was this figure of the shadows which had for its only object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow and from every cloud that was jean valjean's secret that was also god's secret in the presence of this double secret marius recoiled the one in some sort reassured him as to the other god was as visible in this affair as was jean valjean god has his instruments he makes use of the tool which he wills he is not responsible to men do we know
2223,how god sets about the work jean valjean had labored over cosette he had to some extent made that soul that was incontestable well what then the workman was horrible but the work was admirable god produces his miracles as seems good to him he had constructed that charming cosette and he had employed jean valjean it had pleased him to choose this strange collaborator for himself what account have we to demand of him is this the first time that the dung heap has aided the spring to create the rose marius made himself these replies and declared to himself that they were good he had not dared to press jean valjean on all the points which we have just indicated but he did not confess to himself that he did not dare to do it he adored cosette he possessed cosette cosette was splendidly pure that was sufficient for him what enlightenment did he need cosette was a light does light require enlightenment he had everything what more could he desire all is not that enough jean valjean's personal affairs did not concern him and bending over the fatal shadow of that man he clung fast convulsively to
2224,the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch i am nothing to cosette ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence jean valjean was a passer by he had said so himself well he had passed whatever he was his part was finished henceforth there remained marius to fulfil the part of providence to cosette cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself in her lover her husband her celestial male cosette as she took her flight winged and transfigured left behind her on the earth her hideous and empty chrysalis jean valjean in whatever circle of ideas marius revolved he always returned to a certain horror for jean valjean a sacred horror perhaps for as we have just pointed out he felt a quid divinum in that man but do what he would and seek what extenuation he would he was certainly forced to fall back upon this the man was a convict that is to say a being who has not even a place in the social ladder since he is lower than the very lowest rung after the very last of men comes the convict the convict is no longer so to
2225,speak in the semblance of the living the law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can deprive a man marius on penal questions still held to the inexorable system though he was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the subject of those whom the law strikes he had not yet accomplished all progress we admit he had not yet come to distinguish between that which is written by man and that which is written by god between law and right he had not examined and weighed the right which man takes to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable he was not shocked by the word vindicte he found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by eternal suffering and he accepted as the process of civilization social damnation he still stood at this point though safe to advance infallibly later on since his nature was good and at bottom wholly formed of latent progress in this stage of his ideas jean valjean appeared to him hideous and repulsive he was a man reproved he was the convict that word was for
2226,him like the sound of the trump on the day of judgment and after having reflected upon jean valjean for a long time his final gesture had been to turn away his head vade retro marius if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact while interrogating jean valjean to such a point that jean valjean had said you are confessing me had not nevertheless put to him two or three decisive questions it was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind but that he had been afraid of them the jondrette attic the barricade javert who knows where these revelations would have stopped jean valjean did not seem like a man who would draw back and who knows whether marius after having urged him on would not have himself desired to hold him back has it not happened to all of us in certain supreme conjunctures to stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply after we have asked a question it is especially when one loves that one gives way to these exhibitions of cowardice it is not wise to question sinister situations to the last point particularly when the
2227,indissoluble side of our life is fatally intermingled with them what a terrible light might have proceeded from the despairing explanations of jean valjean and who knows whether that hideous glare would not have darted forth as far as cosette who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel the spattering of a lightning flash is of the thunder also fatality has points of juncture where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the reflections which give color the purest figures may forever preserve the reflection of a horrible association rightly or wrongly marius had been afraid he already knew too much he sought to dull his senses rather than to gain further light in dismay he bore off cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to jean valjean that man was the night the living and horrible night how should he dare to seek the bottom of it it is a terrible thing to interrogate the shadow who knows what its reply will be the dawn may be blackened forever by it in this state of mind the thought that that man would
2228,henceforth come into any contact whatever with cosette was a heartrending perplexity to marius he now almost reproached himself for not having put those formidable questions before which he had recoiled and from which an implacable and definitive decision might have sprung he felt that he was too good too gentle too weak if we must say the word this weakness had led him to an imprudent concession he had allowed himself to be touched he had been in the wrong he ought to have simply and purely rejected jean valjean jean valjean played the part of fire and that is what he should have done and have freed his house from that man he was vexed with himself he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions which had deafened blinded and carried him away he was displeased with himself what was he to do now jean valjean's visits were profoundly repugnant to him what was the use in having that man in his house what did the man want here he became dismayed he did not wish to dig down he did not wish to penetrate deeply he did not wish to sound himself he had promised he had
2229,allowed himself to be drawn into a promise jean valjean held his promise one must keep one's word even to a convict above all to a convict still his first duty was to cosette in short he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind passing from one to the other and moved by all of them hence arose a profound trouble it was not easy for him to hide this trouble from cosette but love is a talent and marius succeeded in doing it however without any apparent object he questioned cosette who was as candid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing he talked of her childhood and her youth and he became more and more convinced that that convict had been everything good paternal and respectable that a man can be towards cosette all that marius had caught a glimpse of and had surmised was real that sinister nettle had loved and protected that lily eighth fading away of the twilight i the lower chamber on the following day at nightfall jean valjean knocked at the carriage gate of the gillenormand house it
2230,was basque who received him basque was in the courtyard at the appointed hour as though he had received his orders it sometimes happens that one says to a servant you will watch for mr so and so when he arrives basque addressed jean valjean without waiting for the latter to approach him monsieur le baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to go upstairs or to remain below i will remain below replied jean valjean basque who was perfectly respectful opened the door of the waiting room and said i will go and inform madame the room which jean valjean entered was a damp vaulted room on the ground floor which served as a cellar on occasion which opened on the street was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated window this chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the feather duster the pope's head brush and the broom the dust rested tranquilly there persecution of the spiders was not organized there a fine web which spread far and wide and was very black and ornamented with dead flies formed a wheel on one of the window panes the room
2231,which was small and low ceiled was furnished with a heap of empty bottles piled up in one corner the wall which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash was scaling off in large flakes at one end there was a chimney piece painted in black with a narrow shelf a fire was burning there which indicated that jean valjean's reply i will remain below had been foreseen two arm chairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace between the chairs an old bedside rug which displayed more foundation thread than wool had been spread by way of a carpet the chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight falling through the window jean valjean was fatigued for days he had neither eaten nor slept he threw himself into one of the arm chairs basque returned set a lighted candle on the chimney piece and retired jean valjean his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast perceived neither basque nor the candle all at once he drew himself up with a start cosette was standing beside him he had not seen her enter but he had felt that she was there he
2232,turned round he gazed at her she was adorably lovely but what he was contemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but her soul well exclaimed cosette father i knew that you were peculiar but i never should have expected this what an idea marius told me that you wish me to receive you here yes it is my wish i expected that reply good i warn you that i am going to make a scene for you let us begin at the beginning embrace me father and she offered him her cheek jean valjean remained motionless you do not stir i take note of it attitude of guilt but never mind i pardon you jesus christ said offer the other cheek here it is and she presented her other cheek jean valjean did not move it seemed as though his feet were nailed to the pavement this is becoming serious said cosette what have i done to you i declare that i am perplexed you owe me reparation you will dine with us i have dined that is not true i will get m gillenormand to scold you grandfathers are made to reprimand fathers come go upstairs
2233,with me to the drawing room immediately impossible here cosette lost ground a little she ceased to command and passed to questioning but why and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to see me it's horrible here thou knowest jean valjean caught himself up you know madame that i am peculiar i have my freaks cosette struck her tiny hands together madame you know more novelties what is the meaning of this jean valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he occasionally had recourse you wished to be madame you are so not for you father do not call me father what call me monsieur jean jean if you like you are no longer my father i am no longer cosette monsieur jean what does this mean why these are revolutions aren't they what has taken place come look me in the face and you won't live with us and you won't have my chamber what have i done to you has anything happened nothing well then everything is as usual why do you change your name you have changed yours surely he smiled again with the same smile as before and added since
2234,you are madame pontmercy i certainly can be monsieur jean i don't understand anything about it all this is idiotic i shall ask permission of my husband for you to be monsieur jean i hope that he will not consent to it you cause me a great deal of pain one does have freaks but one does not cause one's little cosette grief that is wrong you have no right to be wicked you who are so good he made no reply she seized his hands with vivacity and raising them to her face with an irresistible movement she pressed them against her neck beneath her chin which is a gesture of profound tenderness oh she said to him be good and she went on this is what i call being good being nice and coming and living here there are birds here as there are in the rue plumet living with us quitting that hole of a rue de l'homme arme not giving us riddles to guess being like all the rest of the world dining with us breakfasting with us being my father he loosed her hands you no longer need a father you have a husband cosette
2235,became angry i no longer need a father one really does not know what to say to things like that which are not common sense if toussaint were here resumed jean valjean like a person who is driven to seek authorities and who clutches at every branch she would be the first to agree that it is true that i have always had ways of my own there is nothing new in this i always have loved my black corner but it is cold here one cannot see distinctly it is abominable that it is to wish to be monsieur jean i will not have you say you to me just now as i was coming hither replied jean valjean i saw a piece of furniture in the rue saint louis it was at a cabinet maker's if i were a pretty woman i would treat myself to that bit of furniture a very neat toilet table in the reigning style what you call rosewood i think it is inlaid the mirror is quite large there are drawers it is pretty hou the villainous bear replied cosette and with supreme grace setting her teeth and drawing back her lips she
2236,blew at jean valjean she was a grace copying a cat i am furious she resumed ever since yesterday you have made me rage all of you i am greatly vexed i don't understand you do not defend me against marius marius will not uphold me against you i am all alone i arrange a chamber prettily if i could have put the good god there i would have done it my chamber is left on my hands my lodger sends me into bankruptcy i order a nice little dinner of nicolette we will have nothing to do with your dinner madame and my father fauchelevent wants me to call him monsieur jean and to receive him in a frightful old ugly cellar where the walls have beards and where the crystal consists of empty bottles and the curtains are of spiders webs you are singular i admit that is your style but people who get married are granted a truce you ought not to have begun being singular again instantly so you are going to be perfectly contented in your abominable rue de l'homme arme i was very desperate indeed there that i was what have you against me
2237,you cause me a great deal of grief fi and becoming suddenly serious she gazed intently at jean valjean and added are you angry with me because i am happy ingenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep this question which was simple for cosette was profound for jean valjean cosette had meant to scratch and she lacerated jean valjean turned pale he remained for a moment without replying then with an inexpressible intonation and speaking to himself he murmured her happiness was the object of my life now god may sign my dismissal cosette thou art happy my day is over ah you have said thou to me exclaimed cosette and she sprang to his neck jean valjean in bewilderment strained her wildly to his breast it almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back thanks father said cosette this enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for jean valjean he gently removed cosette's arms and took his hat well said cosette i leave you madame they are waiting for you and from the threshold he added i have said thou to you tell your husband that this shall not happen again pardon me jean valjean quitted
2238,the room leaving cosette stupefied at this enigmatical farewell ii another step backwards on the following day at the same hour jean valjean came cosette asked him no questions was no longer astonished no longer exclaimed that she was cold no longer spoke of the drawing room she avoided saying either father or monsieur jean she allowed herself to be addressed as you she allowed herself to be called madame only her joy had undergone a certain diminution she would have been sad if sadness had been possible to her it is probable that she had had with marius one of those conversations in which the beloved man says what he pleases explains nothing and satisfies the beloved woman the curiosity of lovers does not extend very far beyond their own love the lower room had made a little toilet basque had suppressed the bottles and nicolette the spiders all the days which followed brought jean valjean at the same hour he came every day because he had not the strength to take marius words otherwise than literally marius arranged matters so as to be absent at the hours when jean valjean came the house grew accustomed to the novel
2239,ways of m fauchelevent toussaint helped in this direction monsieur has always been like that she repeated the grandfather issued this decree he's an original and all was said moreover at the age of ninety six no bond is any longer possible all is merely juxtaposition a newcomer is in the way there is no longer any room all habits are acquired m fauchelevent m tranchelevent father gillenormand asked nothing better than to be relieved from that gentleman he added nothing is more common than those originals they do all sorts of queer things they have no reason the marquis de canaples was still worse he bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret these are fantastic appearances that people affect no one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation and moreover who could have guessed such a thing there are marshes of this description in india the water seems extraordinary inexplicable rippling though there is no wind and agitated where it should be calm one gazes at the surface of these causeless ebullitions one does not perceive the hydra which crawls on the bottom many men have a secret monster in this same manner a dragon which
2240,gnaws them a despair which inhabits their night such a man resembles other men he goes and comes no one knows that he bears within him a frightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth which lives within the unhappy man and of which he is dying no one knows that this man is a gulf he is stagnant but deep from time to time a trouble of which the onlooker understands nothing appears on his surface a mysterious wrinkle is formed then vanishes then re appears an air bubble rises and bursts it is the breathing of the unknown beast certain strange habits arriving at the hour when other people are taking their leave keeping in the background when other people are displaying themselves preserving on all occasions what may be designated as the wall colored mantle seeking the solitary walk preferring the deserted street avoiding any share in conversation avoiding crowds and festivals seeming at one's ease and living poorly having one's key in one's pocket and one's candle at the porter's lodge however rich one may be entering by the side door ascending the private staircase all these insignificant singularities fugitive folds on the surface often proceed from
2241,a formidable foundation many weeks passed in this manner a new life gradually took possession of cosette the relations which marriage creates visits the care of the house pleasures great matters cosette's pleasures were not costly they consisted in one thing being with marius the great occupation of her life was to go out with him to remain with him it was for them a joy that was always fresh to go out arm in arm in the face of the sun in the open street without hiding themselves before the whole world both of them completely alone cosette had one vexation toussaint could not get on with nicolette the soldering of two elderly maids being impossible and she went away the grandfather was well marius argued a case here and there aunt gillenormand peacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her beside the new household jean valjean came every day the address as thou disappeared the you the madame the monsieur jean rendered him another person to cosette the care which he had himself taken to detach her from him was succeeding she became more and more gay and less and less tender yet she still loved him
2242,sincerely and he felt it one day she said to him suddenly you used to be my father you are no longer my father you were my uncle you are no longer my uncle you were monsieur fauchelevent you are jean who are you then i don't like all this if i did not know how good you are i should be afraid of you he still lived in the rue de l'homme arme because he could not make up his mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where cosette dwelt at first he only remained a few minutes with cosette and then went away little by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief one would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization of the days which were lengthening he arrived earlier and departed later one day cosette chanced to say father to him a flash of joy illuminated jean valjean's melancholy old countenance he caught her up say jean ah truly she replied with a burst of laughter monsieur jean that is right said he and he turned aside so that she might not see him wipe his eyes iii
2243,they recall the garden of the rue plumet this was the last time after that last flash of light complete extinction ensued no more familiarity no more good morning with a kiss never more that word so profoundly sweet my father he was at his own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his happinesses one after the other and he had this sorrow that after having lost cosette wholly in one day he was afterwards obliged to lose her again in detail the eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar in short it sufficed for him to have an apparition of cosette every day his whole life was concentrated in that one hour he seated himself close to her he gazed at her in silence or he talked to her of years gone by of her childhood of the convent of her little friends of those bygone days one afternoon it was on one of those early days in april already warm and fresh the moment of the sun's great gayety the gardens which surrounded the windows of marius and cosette felt the emotion of waking the hawthorn was on the point of
2244,budding a jewelled garniture of gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones amid the grass there was a charming beginning of daisies and buttercups the white butterflies of the year were making their first appearance the wind that minstrel of the eternal wedding was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand auroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide marius said to cosette we said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the rue plumet let us go thither we must not be ungrateful and away they flitted like two swallows towards the spring this garden of the rue plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn they already had behind them in life something which was like the springtime of their love the house in the rue plumet being held on a lease still belonged to cosette they went to that garden and that house there they found themselves again there they forgot themselves that evening at the usual hour jean valjean came to the rue des filles du calvaire madame went out with monsieur and has not yet returned basque
2245,said to him he seated himself in silence and waited an hour cosette did not return he departed with drooping head cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to their garden and so joyous at having lived a whole day in her past that she talked of nothing else on the morrow she did not notice that she had not seen jean valjean in what way did you go thither jean valjean asked her on foot and how did you return in a hackney carriage for some time jean valjean had noticed the economical life led by the young people he was troubled by it marius economy was severe and that word had its absolute meaning for jean valjean he hazarded a query why do you not have a carriage of your own a pretty coupe would only cost you five hundred francs a month you are rich i don't know replied cosette it is like toussaint resumed jean valjean she is gone you have not replaced her why nicolette suffices but you ought to have a maid have i not marius you ought to have a house of your own your own servants a carriage a box at the
2246,theatre there is nothing too fine for you why not profit by your riches wealth adds to happiness cosette made no reply jean valjean's visits were not abridged far from it when it is the heart which is slipping one does not halt on the downward slope when jean valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour he sang the praises of marius he pronounced him handsome noble courageous witty eloquent good cosette outdid him jean valjean began again they were never weary marius that word was inexhaustible those six letters contained volumes in this manner jean valjean contrived to remain a long time it was so sweet to see cosette to forget by her side it alleviated his wounds it frequently happened that basque came twice to announce m gillenormand sends me to remind madame la baronne that dinner is served on those days jean valjean was very thoughtful on his return home was there then any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had presented itself to the mind of marius was jean valjean really a chrysalis who would persist and who would come to visit his butterfly one day he remained
2247,still longer than usual on the following day he observed that there was no fire on the hearth hello he thought no fire and he furnished the explanation for himself it is perfectly simple it is april the cold weather has ceased heavens how cold it is here exclaimed cosette when she entered why no said jean valjean was it you who told basque not to make a fire then yes since we are now in the month of may but we have a fire until june one is needed all the year in this cellar i thought that a fire was unnecessary that is exactly like one of your ideas retorted cosette on the following day there was a fire but the two arm chairs were arranged at the other end of the room near the door what is the meaning of this thought jean valjean he went for the arm chairs and restored them to their ordinary place near the hearth this fire lighted once more encouraged him however he prolonged the conversation even beyond its customary limits as he rose to take his leave cosette said to him my husband said a queer thing to me yesterday
2248,what was it he said to me cosette we have an income of thirty thousand livres twenty seven that you own and three that my grandfather gives me i replied that makes thirty he went on would you have the courage to live on the three thousand i answered yes on nothing provided that it was with you and then i asked why do you say that to me he replied i wanted to know jean valjean found not a word to answer cosette probably expected some explanation from him he listened in gloomy silence he went back to the rue de l'homme arme he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door and instead of entering his own house he entered the adjoining dwelling it was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he perceived his error and went down again his mind was swarming with conjectures it was evident that marius had his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs that he feared some source that was not pure who knows that he had even perhaps discovered that the money came from him jean valjean that he hesitated before this suspicious fortune
2249,and was disinclined to take it as his own preferring that both he and cosette should remain poor rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean moreover jean valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown the door on the following day he underwent something like a shock on entering the ground floor room the arm chairs had disappeared there was not a single chair of any sort ah what's this exclaimed cosette as she entered no chairs where are the arm chairs they are no longer here replied jean valjean this is too much jean valjean stammered it was i who told basque to remove them and your reason i have only a few minutes to stay to day a brief stay is no reason for remaining standing i think that basque needed the chairs for the drawing room why you have company this evening no doubt we expect no one jean valjean had not another word to say cosette shrugged her shoulders to have the chairs carried off the other day you had the fire put out how odd you are adieu murmured jean valjean he did not say adieu cosette
2250,but he had not the strength to say adieu madame he went away utterly overwhelmed this time he had understood on the following day he did not come cosette only observed the fact in the evening why said she monsieur jean has not been here today and she felt a slight twinge at her heart but she hardly perceived it being immediately diverted by a kiss from marius on the following day he did not come cosette paid no heed to this passed her evening and slept well that night as usual and thought of it only when she woke she was so happy she speedily despatched nicolette to m jean's house to inquire whether he were ill and why he had not come on the previous evening nicolette brought back the reply of m jean that he was not ill he was busy he would come soon as soon as he was able moreover he was on the point of taking a little journey madame must remember that it was his custom to take trips from time to time they were not to worry about him they were not to think of him nicolette on entering m jean's had
2251,repeated to him her mistress very words that madame had sent her to inquire why m jean bad not come on the preceding evening it is two days since i have been there said jean valjean gently but the remark passed unnoticed by nicolette who did not report it to cosette iv attraction and extinction during the last months of spring and the first months of summer in the rare passersby in the marais the petty shopkeepers the loungers on thresholds noticed an old man neatly clad in black who emerged every day at the same hour towards nightfall from the rue de l'homme arme on the side of the rue sainte croix de la bretonnerie passed in front of the blancs manteaux gained the rue culture sainte catherine and on arriving at the rue de l'echarpe turned to the left and entered the rue saint louis there he walked at a slow pace with his head strained forward seeing nothing hearing nothing his eye immovably fixed on a point which seemed to be a star to him which never varied and which was no other than the corner of the rue des filles du calvaire the nearer he approached
2252,the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up a sort of joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora he had a fascinated and much affected air his lips indulged in obscure movements as though he were talking to some one whom he did not see he smiled vaguely and advanced as slowly as possible one would have said that while desirous of reaching his destination he feared the moment when he should be close at hand when only a few houses remained between him and that street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened to such a degree that at times one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all the vacillation of his head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole whatever time he spent on arriving he was obliged to arrive at last he reached the rue des filles du calvaire then he halted he trembled he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of the last house and gazed into that street and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the dazzling light
2253,of the impossible and the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him then a tear which had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids and had become large enough to fall trickled down his cheek and sometimes stopped at his mouth the old man tasted its bitter flavor thus he remained for several minutes as though made of stone then he returned by the same road and with the same step and in proportion as he retreated his glance died out little by little this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the rue des filles du calvaire he halted half way in the rue saint louis sometimes a little further off sometimes a little nearer one day he stopped at the corner of the rue culture sainte catherine and looked at the rue des filles du calvaire from a distance then he shook his head slowly from right to left as though refusing himself something and retraced his steps soon he no longer came as far as the rue saint louis he got as far as the rue pavee shook his head and turned back then he went no further than the
2254,rue des trois pavillons then he did not overstep the blancs manteaux one would have said that he was a pendulum which was no longer wound up and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing altogether every day he emerged from his house at the same hour he undertook the same trip but he no longer completed it and perhaps without himself being aware of the fact he constantly shortened it his whole countenance expressed this single idea what is the use his eye was dim no more radiance his tears were also exhausted they no longer collected in the corner of his eye lid that thoughtful eye was dry the old man's head was still craned forward his chin moved at times the folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold sometimes when the weather was bad he had an umbrella under his arm but he never opened it the good women of the quarter said he is an innocent the children followed him and laughed ninth supreme shadow supreme dawn i pity for the unhappy but indulgence for the happy it is a terrible thing to be happy how content one is how all sufficient one finds
2255,it how being in possession of the false object of life happiness one forgets the true object duty let us say however that the reader would do wrong were he to blame marius marius as we have explained before his marriage had put no questions to m fauchelevent and since that time he had feared to put any to jean valjean he had regretted the promise into which he had allowed himself to be drawn he had often said to himself that he had done wrong in making that concession to despair he had confined himself to gradually estranging jean valjean from his house and to effacing him as much as possible from cosette's mind he had in a manner always placed himself between cosette and jean valjean sure that in this way she would not perceive nor think of the latter it was more than effacement it was an eclipse marius did what he considered necessary and just he thought that he had serious reasons which the reader has already seen and others which will be seen later on for getting rid of jean valjean without harshness but without weakness chance having ordained that he should encounter in a
2256,case which he had argued a former employee of the laffitte establishment he had acquired mysterious information without seeking it which he had not been able it is true to probe out of respect for the secret which he had promised to guard and out of consideration for jean valjean's perilous position he believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some one whom he sought with all possible discretion in the meanwhile he abstained from touching that money as for cosette she had not been initiated into any of these secrets but it would be harsh to condemn her also there existed between marius and her an all powerful magnetism which caused her to do instinctively and almost mechanically what marius wished she was conscious of marius will in the direction of monsieur jean she conformed to it her husband had not been obliged to say anything to her she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his tacit intentions and obeyed blindly her obedience in this instance consisted in not remembering what marius forgot she was not obliged to make any effort to accomplish
2257,this without her knowing why herself and without his having any cause to accuse her of it her soul had become so wholly her husband's that that which was shrouded in gloom in marius mind became overcast in hers let us not go too far however in what concerns jean valjean this forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial she was rather heedless than forgetful at bottom she was sincerely attached to the man whom she had so long called her father but she loved her husband still more dearly this was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of her heart which leaned to one side only it sometimes happened that cosette spoke of jean valjean and expressed her surprise then marius calmed her he is absent i think did not he say that he was setting out on a journey that is true thought cosette he had a habit of disappearing in this fashion but not for so long two or three times she despatched nicolette to inquire in the rue de l'homme arme whether m jean had returned from his journey jean valjean caused the answer no to be given cosette asked nothing more since she had but one
2258,need on earth marius let us also say that on their side cosette and marius had also been absent they had been to vernon marius had taken cosette to his father's grave marius gradually won cosette away from jean valjean cosette allowed it moreover that which is called far too harshly in certain cases the ingratitude of children is not always a thing so deserving of reproach as it is supposed it is the ingratitude of nature nature as we have elsewhere said looks before her nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing those who are departing are turned towards the shadows those who are arriving towards the light hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old and involuntary on the part of the young this breach at first insensible increases slowly like all separations of branches the boughs without becoming detached from the trunk grow away from it it is no fault of theirs youth goes where there is joy festivals vivid lights love old age goes towards the end they do not lose sight of each other but there is no longer a close connection young people
2259,feel the cooling off of life old people that of the tomb let us not blame these poor children ii last flickerings of a lamp without oil one day jean valjean descended his staircase took three steps in the street seated himself on a post on that same stone post where gavroche had found him meditating on the night between the th and the th of june he remained there a few moments then went up stairs again this was the last oscillation of the pendulum on the following day he did not leave his apartment on the day after that he did not leave his bed his portress who prepared his scanty repasts a few cabbages or potatoes with bacon glanced at the brown earthenware plate and exclaimed but you ate nothing yesterday poor dear man certainly i did replied jean valjean the plate is quite full look at the water jug it is empty that proves that you have drunk it does not prove that you have eaten well said jean valjean what if i felt hungry only for water that is called thirst and when one does not eat at the same time it is called fever
2260,i will eat to morrow or at trinity day why not to day is it the thing to say i will eat to morrow the idea of leaving my platter without even touching it my ladyfinger potatoes were so good jean valjean took the old woman's hand i promise you that i will eat them he said in his benevolent voice i am not pleased with you replied the portress jean valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman there are streets in paris through which no one ever passes and houses to which no one ever comes he was in one of those streets and one of those houses while he still went out he had purchased of a coppersmith for a few sous a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite his bed that gibbet is always good to look at a week passed and jean valjean had not taken a step in his room he still remained in bed the portress said to her husband the good man upstairs yonder does not get up he no longer eats he will not last long that man has his sorrows that he
2261,has you won't get it out of my head that his daughter has made a bad marriage the porter replied with the tone of marital sovereignty if he's rich let him have a doctor if he is not rich let him go without if he has no doctor he will die and if he has one he will die said the porter the portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called her pavement with an old knife and as she tore out the blades she grumbled it's a shame such a neat old man he's as white as a chicken she caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of the street she took it upon herself to request him to come up stairs it's on the second floor said she you have only to enter as the good man no longer stirs from his bed the door is always unlocked the doctor saw jean valjean and spoke with him when he came down again the portress interrogated him well doctor your sick man is very ill indeed what is the matter with him everything and nothing he is a man who
2262,to all appearances has lost some person who is dear to him people die of that what did he say to you he told me that he was in good health shall you come again doctor yes replied the doctor but some one else besides must come iii a pen is heavy to the man who lifted the fauchelevent's cart one evening jean valjean found difficulty in raising himself on his elbow he felt of his wrist and could not find his pulse his breath was short and halted at times he recognized the fact that he was weaker than he had ever been before then no doubt under the pressure of some supreme preoccupation he made an effort drew himself up into a sitting posture and dressed himself he put on his old workingman's clothes as he no longer went out he had returned to them and preferred them he was obliged to pause many times while dressing himself merely putting his arms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from his forehead since he had been alone he had placed his bed in the antechamber in order to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible he opened
2263,the valise and drew from it cosette's outfit he spread it out on his bed the bishop's candlesticks were in their place on the chimney piece he took from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks then although it was still broad daylight it was summer he lighted them in the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylight in chambers where there is a corpse every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another exhausted him and he was obliged to sit down it was not ordinary fatigue which expends the strength only to renew it it was the remnant of all movement possible to him it was life drained which flows away drop by drop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be renewed the chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front of that mirror so fatal for him so providential for marius in which he had read cosette's reversed writing on the blotting book he caught sight of himself in this mirror and did not recognize himself he was eighty years old before marius marriage he would have hardly been
2264,taken for fifty that year had counted for thirty what he bore on his brow was no longer the wrinkles of age it was the mysterious mark of death the hollowing of that pitiless nail could be felt there his cheeks were pendulous the skin of his face had the color which would lead one to think that it already had earth upon it the corners of his mouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured on tombs he gazed into space with an air of reproach one would have said that he was one of those grand tragic beings who have cause to complain of some one he was in that condition the last phase of dejection in which sorrow no longer flows it is coagulated so to speak there is something on the soul like a clot of despair night had come he laboriously dragged a table and the old arm chair to the fireside and placed upon the table a pen some ink and some paper that done he had a fainting fit when he recovered consciousness he was thirsty as he could not lift the jug he tipped it over painfully towards his mouth
2265,and swallowed a draught as neither the pen nor the ink had been used for a long time the point of the pen had curled up the ink had dried away he was forced to rise and put a few drops of water in the ink which he did not accomplish without pausing and sitting down two or three times and he was compelled to write with the back of the pen he wiped his brow from time to time then he turned towards the bed and still seated for he could not stand he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects these contemplations lasted for hours which seemed minutes all at once he shivered he felt that a child was taking possession of him he rested his elbows on the table which was illuminated by the bishop's candles and took up the pen his hand trembled he wrote slowly the few following lines cosette i bless thee i am going to explain to thee thy husband was right in giving me to understand that i ought to go away but there is a little error in what he believed though he was in the right
2266,he is excellent love him well even after i am dead monsieur pontmercy love my darling child well cosette this paper will be found this is what i wish to say to thee thou wilt see the figures if i have the strength to recall them listen well this money is really thine here is the whole matter white jet comes from norway black jet comes from england black glass jewellery comes from germany jet is the lightest the most precious the most costly imitations can be made in france as well as in germany what is needed is a little anvil two inches square and a lamp burning spirits of wine to soften the wax the wax was formerly made with resin and lampblack and cost four livres the pound i invented a way of making it with gum shellac and turpentine it does not cost more than thirty sous and is much better buckles are made with a violet glass which is stuck fast by means of this wax to a little framework of black iron the glass must be violet for iron jewellery and black for gold jewellery spain buys a great deal of it it is
2267,the country of jet here he paused the pen fell from his fingers he was seized by one of those sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being the poor man clasped his head in both hands and meditated oh he exclaimed within himself lamentable cries heard by god alone all is over i shall never see her more she is a smile which passed over me i am about to plunge into the night without even seeing her again oh one minute one instant to hear her voice to touch her dress to gaze upon her upon her the angel and then to die it is nothing to die what is frightful is to die without seeing her she would smile on me she would say a word to me would that do any harm to any one no all is over and forever here i am all alone my god my god i shall never see her again at that moment there came a knock at the door iv a bottle of ink which only succeeded in whitening that same day or to speak more accurately that same evening as marius left the
2268,table and was on the point of withdrawing to his study having a case to look over basque handed him a letter saying the person who wrote the letter is in the antechamber cosette had taken the grandfather's arm and was strolling in the garden a letter like a man may have an unprepossessing exterior coarse paper coarsely folded the very sight of certain missives is displeasing the letter which basque had brought was of this sort marius took it it smelled of tobacco nothing evokes a memory like an odor marius recognized that tobacco he looked at the superscription to monsieur monsieur le baron pommerci at his hotel the recognition of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well it may be said that amazement has its lightning flashes marius was as it were illuminated by one of these flashes the sense of smell that mysterious aid to memory had just revived a whole world within him this was certainly the paper the fashion of folding the dull tint of ink it was certainly the well known handwriting especially was it the same tobacco the jondrette garret rose before his mind thus strange freak of chance one
2269,of the two scents which he had so diligently sought the one in connection with which he had lately again exerted so many efforts and which he supposed to be forever lost had come and presented itself to him of its own accord he eagerly broke the seal and read monsieur le baron if the supreme being had given me the talents i might have been baron thenard member of the institute academy of ciences but i am not i only bear the same as him happy if this memory recommends me to the eccellence of your kindnesses the benefit with which you will honor me will be reciprocle i am in possession of a secret concerning an individual this individual concerns you i hold the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honor to be huseful to you i will furnish you with the simple means of driving from your honorabel family that individual who has no right there madame la baronne being of lofty birth the sanctuary of virtue cannot cohabit longer with crime without abdicating i awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron with respect the letter was signed thenard this signature was
2270,not false it was merely a trifle abridged moreover the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation the certificate of origin was complete marius emotion was profound after a start of surprise he underwent a feeling of happiness if he could now but find that other man of whom he was in search the man who had saved him marius there would be nothing left for him to desire he opened the drawer of his secretary took out several bank notes put them in his pocket closed the secretary again and rang the bell basque half opened the door show the man in said marius basque announced monsieur thenard a man entered a fresh surprise for marius the man who entered was an utter stranger to him this man who was old moreover had a thick nose his chin swathed in a cravat green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over his eyes and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on a level with his eyebrows like the wigs of english coachmen in high life his hair was gray he was dressed in black from head to foot in garments that were very threadbare
2271,but clean a bunch of seals depending from his fob suggested the idea of a watch he held in his hand an old hat he walked in a bent attitude and the curve in his spine augmented the profundity of his bow the first thing that struck the observer was that this personage's coat which was too ample although carefully buttoned had not been made for him here a short digression becomes necessary there was in paris at that epoch in a low lived old lodging in the rue beautreillis near the arsenal an ingenious jew whose profession was to change villains into honest men not for too long which might have proved embarrassing for the villain the change was on sight for a day or two at the rate of thirty sous a day by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible this costumer was called the changer the pickpockets of paris had given him this name and knew him by no other he had a tolerably complete wardrobe the rags with which he tricked out people were almost probable he had specialties and categories on each nail of
2272,his shop hung a social status threadbare and worn here the suit of a magistrate there the outfit of a cure beyond the outfit of a banker in one corner the costume of a retired military man elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters and further on the dress of a statesman this creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in paris his lair was the green room whence theft emerged and into which roguery retreated a tattered knave arrived at this dressing room deposited his thirty sous and selected according to the part which he wished to play the costume which suited him and on descending the stairs once more the knave was a somebody on the following day the clothes were faithfully returned and the changer who trusted the thieves with everything was never robbed there was one inconvenience about these clothes they did not fit not having been made for those who wore them they were too tight for one too loose for another and did not adjust themselves to any one every pickpocket who exceeded or fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the changer's costumes
2273,it was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean the changer had foreseen only ordinary men he had taken the measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand who is neither stout nor thin neither tall nor short hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from which the changer's clients extricated themselves as best they might so much the worse for the exceptions the suit of the statesman for instance black from head to foot and consequently proper would have been too large for pitt and too small for castelcicala the costume of a statesman was designated as follows in the changer's catalogue we copy a coat of black cloth trowsers of black wool a silk waistcoat boots and linen on the margin there stood ex ambassador and a note which we also copy in a separate box a neatly frizzed peruke green glasses seals and two small quills an inch long wrapped in cotton all this belonged to the statesman the ex ambassador this whole costume was if we may so express ourselves debilitated the seams were white a vague button hole yawned at one of the elbows moreover one
2274,of the coat buttons was missing on the breast but this was only detail as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart its function was to conceal the absent button if marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of paris he would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom basque had just shown in the statesman's suit borrowed from the pick me down that shop of the changer marius disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he expected to see turned to the newcomer's disadvantage he surveyed him from head to foot while that personage made exaggerated bows and demanded in a curt tone what do you want the man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a crocodile will furnish some idea it seems to me impossible that i should not have already had the honor of seeing monsieur le baron in society i think i actually did meet monsieur personally several years ago at the house of madame la princesse bagration and in the drawing rooms of his lordship the vicomte dambray peer of france it is always
2275,a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize some one whom one does not know marius paid attention to the manner of this man's speech he spied on his accent and gesture but his disappointment increased the pronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry shrill tone which he had expected he was utterly routed i know neither madame bagration nor m dambray said he i have never set foot in the house of either of them in my life the reply was ungracious the personage determined to be gracious at any cost insisted then it must have been at chateaubriand's that i have seen monsieur i know chateaubriand very well he is very affable he sometimes says to me thenard my friend won't you drink a glass of wine with me marius brow grew more and more severe i have never had the honor of being received by m de chateaubriand let us cut it short what do you want the man bowed lower at that harsh voice monsieur le baron deign to listen to me there is in america in a district near panama a village called la joya that village is composed of a
2276,single house a large square house of three stories built of bricks dried in the sun each side of the square five hundred feet in length each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below in such a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit of the edifice in the centre an inner court where the provisions and munitions are kept no windows loopholes no doors ladders ladders to mount from the ground to the first terrace and from the first to the second and from the second to the third ladders to descend into the inner court no doors to the chambers trap doors no staircases to the chambers ladders in the evening the traps are closed the ladders are withdrawn carbines and blunderbusses trained from the loopholes no means of entering a house by day a citadel by night eight hundred inhabitants that is the village why so many precautions because the country is dangerous it is full of cannibals then why do people go there because the country is marvellous gold is found there what are you driving at interrupted marius who had passed from disappointment to impatience at this monsieur
2277,le baron i am an old and weary diplomat ancient civilization has thrown me on my own devices i want to try savages well monsieur le baron egotism is the law of the world the proletarian peasant woman who toils by the day turns round when the diligence passes by the peasant proprietress who toils in her field does not turn round the dog of the poor man barks at the rich man the dog of the rich man barks at the poor man each one for himself self interest that's the object of men gold that's the loadstone what then finish i should like to go and establish myself at la joya there are three of us i have my spouse and my young lady a very beautiful girl the journey is long and costly i need a little money what concern is that of mine demanded marius the stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat a gesture characteristic of the vulture and replied with an augmented smile has not monsieur le baron perused my letter there was some truth in this the fact is that the contents of the epistle had slipped marius mind he had seen
2278,the writing rather than read the letter he could hardly recall it but a moment ago a fresh start had been given him he had noted that detail my spouse and my young lady he fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger an examining judge could not have done the look better he almost lay in wait for him he confined himself to replying state the case precisely the stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs drew himself up without straightening his dorsal column but scrutinizing marius in his turn with the green gaze of his spectacles so be it monsieur le baron i will be precise i have a secret to sell to you a secret a secret which concerns me somewhat what is the secret marius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him i commence gratis said the stranger you will see that i am interesting speak monsieur le baron you have in your house a thief and an assassin marius shuddered in my house no said he the imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on an assassin and a thief remark monsieur le baron that i do
2279,not here speak of ancient deeds deeds of the past which have lapsed which can be effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before god i speak of recent deeds of actual facts as still unknown to justice at this hour i continue this man has insinuated himself into your confidence and almost into your family under a false name i am about to tell you his real name and to tell it to you for nothing i am listening his name is jean valjean i know it i am going to tell you equally for nothing who he is say on he is an ex convict i know it you know it since i have had the honor of telling you no i knew it before marius cold tone that double reply of i know it his laconicism which was not favorable to dialogue stirred up some smouldering wrath in the stranger he launched a furious glance on the sly at marius which was instantly extinguished rapid as it was this glance was of the kind which a man recognizes when he has once beheld it it did not escape marius certain flashes can only proceed from
2280,certain souls the eye that vent hole of the thought glows with it spectacles hide nothing try putting a pane of glass over hell the stranger resumed with a smile i will not permit myself to contradict monsieur le baron in any case you ought to perceive that i am well informed now what i have to tell you is known to myself alone this concerns the fortune of madame la baronne it is an extraordinary secret it is for sale i make you the first offer of it cheap twenty thousand francs i know that secret as well as the others said marius the personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle monsieur le baron say ten thousand francs and i will speak i repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me i know what you wish to say to me a fresh flash gleamed in the man's eye he exclaimed but i must dine to day nevertheless it is an extraordinary secret i tell you monsieur le baron i will speak i speak give me twenty francs marius gazed intently at him i know your extraordinary secret just as i knew jean
2281,valjean's name just as i know your name my name yes that is not difficult monsieur le baron i had the honor to write to you and to tell it to you thenard dier hey thenardier who's that in danger the porcupine bristles up the beetle feigns death the old guard forms in a square this man burst into laughter then he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a fillip marius continued you are also jondrette the workman fabantou the comedian genflot the poet don alvares the spaniard and mistress balizard mistress what and you kept a pot house at montfermeil a pot house never and i tell you that your name is thenardier i deny it and that you are a rascal here and marius drew a bank note from his pocket and flung it in his face thanks pardon me five hundred francs monsieur le baron and the man overcome bowed seized the note and examined it five hundred francs he began again taken aback and he stammered in a low voice an honest rustler then brusquely well so be it he exclaimed let us put ourselves at our ease and with
2282,the agility of a monkey flinging back his hair tearing off his spectacles and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the two quills of which mention was recently made and which the reader has also met with on another page of this book he took off his face as the man takes off his hat his eye lighted up his uneven brow with hollows in some places and bumps in others hideously wrinkled at the top was laid bare his nose had become as sharp as a beak the fierce and sagacious profile of the man of prey reappeared monsieur le baron is infallible he said in a clear voice whence all nasal twang had disappeared i am thenardier and he straightened up his crooked back thenardier for it was really he was strangely surprised he would have been troubled had he been capable of such a thing he had come to bring astonishment and it was he who had received it this humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him and taking it all in all he accepted it but he was none the less bewildered he beheld this baron pontmercy for the first time and
2283,in spite of his disguise this baron pontmercy recognized him and recognized him thoroughly and not only was this baron perfectly informed as to thenardier but he seemed well posted as to jean valjean who was this almost beardless young man who was so glacial and so generous who knew people's names who knew all their names and who opened his purse to them who bullied rascals like a judge and who paid them like a dupe thenardier the reader will remember although he had been marius neighbor had never seen him which is not unusual in paris he had formerly in a vague way heard his daughters talk of a very poor young man named marius who lived in the house he had written to him without knowing him the letter with which the reader is acquainted no connection between that marius and m le baron pontmercy was possible in his mind as for the name pontmercy it will be recalled that on the battlefield of waterloo he had only heard the last two syllables for which he always entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely an expression of thanks however through his daughter azelma
2284,who had started on the scent of the married pair on the th of february and through his own personal researches he had succeeded in learning many things and from the depths of his own gloom he had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious clew he had discovered by dint of industry or at least by dint of induction he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on a certain day in the grand sewer from the man he had easily reached the name he knew that madame la baronne pontmercy was cosette but he meant to be discreet in that quarter who was cosette he did not know exactly himself he did indeed catch an inkling of illegitimacy the history of fantine had always seemed to him equivocal but what was the use of talking about that in order to cause himself to be paid for his silence he had or thought he had better wares than that for sale and according to all appearances if he were to come and make to the baron pontmercy this revelation and without proof your wife is a bastard the only result would be to attract the boot
2285,of the husband towards the loins of the revealer from thenardier's point of view the conversation with marius had not yet begun he ought to have drawn back to have modified his strategy to have abandoned his position to have changed his front but nothing essential had been compromised as yet and he had five hundred francs in his pocket moreover he had something decisive to say and even against this very well informed and well armed baron pontmercy he felt himself strong for men of thenardier's nature every dialogue is a combat in the one in which he was about to engage what was his situation he did not know to whom he was speaking but he did know of what he was speaking he made this rapid review of his inner forces and after having said i am thenardier he waited marius had become thoughtful so he had hold of thenardier at last that man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him he could honor colonel pontmercy's recommendation he felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this villain and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb
2286,by his father upon him marius had been protested up to that day it also seemed to him in the complex state of his mind towards thenardier that there was occasion to avenge the colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a rascal in any case he was content he was about to deliver the colonel's shade from this unworthy creditor at last and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his father's memory from the debtors prison by the side of this duty there was another to elucidate if possible the source of cosette's fortune the opportunity appeared to present itself perhaps thenardier knew something it might prove useful to see the bottom of this man he commenced with this thenardier had caused the honest rustler to disappear in his fob and was gazing at marius with a gentleness that was almost tender marius broke the silence thenardier i have told you your name now would you like to have me tell you your secret the one that you came here to reveal to me i have information of my own also you shall see that i know more about it
2287,than you do jean valjean as you have said is an assassin and a thief a thief because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer whose ruin he brought about an assassin because he assassinated police agent javert i don't understand sir ejaculated thenardier i will make myself intelligible in a certain arrondissement of the pas de calais there was in a man who had fallen out with justice and who under the name of m madeleine had regained his status and rehabilitated himself this man had become a just man in the full force of the term in a trade the manufacture of black glass goods he made the fortune of an entire city as far as his personal fortune was concerned he made that also but as a secondary matter and in some sort by accident he was the foster father of the poor he founded hospitals opened schools visited the sick dowered young girls supported widows and adopted orphans he was like the guardian angel of the country he refused the cross he was appointed mayor a liberated convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days he denounced him and had him arrested
2288,and profited by the arrest to come to paris and cause the banker laffitte i have the fact from the cashier himself by means of a false signature to hand over to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to m madeleine this convict who robbed m madeleine was jean valjean as for the other fact you have nothing to tell me about it either jean valjean killed the agent javert he shot him with a pistol i the person who is speaking to you was present thenardier cast upon marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who lays his hand once more upon the victory and who has just regained in one instant all the ground which he has lost but the smile returned instantly the inferior's triumph in the presence of his superior must be wheedling thenardier contented himself with saying to marius monsieur le baron we are on the wrong track and he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an expressive whirl what broke forth marius do you dispute that these are facts they are chimeras the confidence with which monsieur le baron honors me renders it my duty
2289,to tell him so truth and justice before all things i do not like to see folks accused unjustly monsieur le baron jean valjean did not rob m madeleine and jean valjean did not kill javert this is too much how is this for two reasons what are they speak this is the first he did not rob m madeleine because it is jean valjean himself who was m madeleine what tale are you telling me and this is the second he did not assassinate javert because the person who killed javert was javert what do you mean to say that javert committed suicide prove it prove it cried marius beside himself thenardier resumed scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient alexandrine measure police agent ja vert was found drowned un der a boat of the pont au change but prove it thenardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper which seemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes i have my papers he said calmly and he added monsieur le baron in your interests i desired to know jean valjean thoroughly i say that jean valjean and m madeleine are one and the same
2290,man and i say that javert had no other assassin than javert if i speak it is because i have proofs not manuscript proofs writing is suspicious handwriting is complaisant but printed proofs as he spoke thenardier extracted from the envelope two copies of newspapers yellow faded and strongly saturated with tobacco one of these two newspapers broken at every fold and falling into rags seemed much older than the other two facts two proofs remarked thenardier and he offered the two newspapers unfolded to marius the reader is acquainted with these two papers one the most ancient a number of the drapeau blanc of the th of july the text of which can be seen in the first volume established the identity of m madeleine and jean valjean the other a moniteur of the th of june announced the suicide of javert adding that it appeared from a verbal report of javert to the prefect that having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgent who holding him under his pistol had fired into the air instead of blowing out his brains marius read
2291,he had evidence a certain date irrefragable proof these two newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backing up thenardier's statements the note printed in the moniteur had been an administrative communication from the prefecture of police marius could not doubt the information of the cashier clerk had been false and he himself had been deceived jean valjean who had suddenly grown grand emerged from his cloud marius could not repress a cry of joy well then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man the whole of that fortune really belonged to him he is madeleine the providence of a whole countryside he is jean valjean javert's savior he is a hero he is a saint he's not a saint and he's not a hero said thenardier he's an assassin and a robber and he added in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possesses some authority let us be calm robber assassin those words which marius thought had disappeared and which returned fell upon him like an ice cold shower bath again said he always ejaculated thenardier jean valjean did not rob madeleine but he is a thief he did not kill
2292,javert but he is a murderer will you speak retorted marius of that miserable theft committed forty years ago and expiated as your own newspapers prove by a whole life of repentance of self abnegation and of virtue i say assassination and theft monsieur le baron and i repeat that i am speaking of actual facts what i have to reveal to you is absolutely unknown it belongs to unpublished matter and perhaps you will find in it the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to madame la baronne by jean valjean i say skilfully because by a gift of that nature it would not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose comforts one would then share and at the same stroke to conceal one's crime and to enjoy one's theft to bury one's name and to create for oneself a family i might interrupt you at this point said marius but go on monsieur le baron i will tell you all leaving the recompense to your generosity this secret is worth massive gold you will say to me why do not you apply to jean valjean for a very simple reason i know that
2293,he has stripped himself and stripped himself in your favor and i consider the combination ingenious but he has no longer a son he would show me his empty hands and since i am in need of some money for my trip to la joya i prefer you you who have it all to him who has nothing i am a little fatigued permit me to take a chair marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same thenardier installed himself on a tufted chair picked up his two newspapers thrust them back into their envelope and murmured as he pecked at the drapeau blanc with his nail it cost me a good deal of trouble to get this one that done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of the chair an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what they are saying then he entered upon his subject gravely emphasizing his words monsieur le baron on the th of june about a year ago on the day of the insurrection a man was in the grand sewer of paris at the point where the sewer enters the seine between the pont
2294,des invalides and the pont de jena marius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of thenardier thenardier noticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator who holds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating under his words this man forced to conceal himself and for reasons moreover which are foreign to politics had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had a key to it it was i repeat on the th of june it might have been eight o'clock in the evening the man hears a noise in the sewer greatly surprised he hides himself and lies in wait it was the sound of footsteps some one was walking in the dark and coming in his direction strange to say there was another man in the sewer besides himself the grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off a little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the newcomer and to see that the man was carrying something on his back he was walking in a bent attitude the man who was walking in a bent attitude was an ex convict and what he was dragging on his shoulders
2295,was a corpse assassination caught in the very act if ever there was such a thing as for the theft that is understood one does not kill a man gratis this convict was on his way to fling the body into the river one fact is to be noticed that before reaching the exit grating this convict who had come a long distance in the sewer must necessarily have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as though he might have left the body but the sewermen would have found the assassinated man the very next day while at work on the quagmire and that did not suit the assassin's plans he had preferred to traverse that quagmire with his burden and his exertions must have been terrible for it is impossible to risk one's life more completely i don't understand how he could have come out of that alive marius chair approached still nearer thenardier took advantage of this to draw a long breath he went on monsieur le baron a sewer is not the champ de mars one lacks everything there even room when two men are there they must meet that is what happened the man domiciled
2296,there and the passer by were forced to bid each other good day greatly to the regret of both the passer by said to the inhabitant you see what i have on my back i must get out you have the key give it to me that convict was a man of terrible strength there was no way of refusing nevertheless the man who had the key parleyed simply to gain time he examined the dead man but he could see nothing except that the latter was young well dressed with the air of being rich and all disfigured with blood while talking the man contrived to tear and pull off behind without the assassin perceiving it a bit of the assassinated man's coat a document for conviction you understand a means of recovering the trace of things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal he put this document for conviction in his pocket after which he opened the grating made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back closed the grating again and ran off not caring to be mixed up with the remainder of the adventure and above all not wishing to be present
2297,when the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river now you comprehend the man who was carrying the corpse was jean valjean the one who had the key is speaking to you at this moment and the piece of the coat thenardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket and holding on a level with his eyes nipped between his two thumbs and his two forefingers a strip of torn black cloth all covered with dark spots marius had sprung to his feet pale hardly able to draw his breath with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth and without uttering a word without taking his eyes from that fragment he retreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney he found the key opened the cupboard plunged his arm into it without looking and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which thenardier still held outspread but thenardier continued monsieur le baron i have the strongest of reasons for believing that the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by jean valjean and
2298,the bearer of an enormous sum of money the young man was myself and here is the coat cried marius and he flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood then snatching the fragment from the hands of thenardier he crouched down over the coat and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt the rent fitted exactly and the strip completed the coat thenardier was petrified this is what he thought i'm struck all of a heap marius rose to his feet trembling despairing radiant he fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to thenardier presenting to him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with bank notes for five hundred and a thousand francs you are an infamous wretch you are a liar a calumniator a villain you came to accuse that man you have only justified him you wanted to ruin him you have only succeeded in glorifying him and it is you who are the thief and it is you who are the assassin i saw you thenardier jondrette in that lair on the rue de l'hopital i know enough about you to send you to the galleys and even
2299,further if i choose here are a thousand francs bully that you are and he flung a thousand franc note at thenardier ah jondrette thenardier vile rascal let this serve you as a lesson you dealer in second hand secrets merchant of mysteries rummager of the shadows wretch take these five hundred francs and get out of here waterloo protects you waterloo growled thenardier pocketing the five hundred francs along with the thousand yes assassin you there saved the life of a colonel of a general said thenardier elevating his head of a colonel repeated marius in a rage i wouldn't give a ha'penny for a general and you come here to commit infamies i tell you that you have committed all crimes go disappear only be happy that is all that i desire ah monster here are three thousand francs more take them you will depart to morrow for america with your daughter for your wife is dead you abominable liar i shall watch over your departure you ruffian and at that moment i will count out to you twenty thousand francs go get yourself hung elsewhere monsieur le baron replied thenardier bowing to the very earth eternal gratitude
2300,and thenardier left the room understanding nothing stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks of gold and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in bank bills struck by lightning he was but he was also content and he would have been greatly angered had he had a lightning rod to ward off such lightning as that let us finish with this man at once two days after the events which we are at this moment narrating he set out thanks to marius care for america under a false name with his daughter azelma furnished with a draft on new york for twenty thousand francs the moral wretchedness of thenardier the bourgeois who had missed his vocation was irremediable he was in america what he had been in europe contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to corrupt a good action and to cause evil things to spring from it with marius money thenardier set up as a slave dealer as soon as thenardier had left the house marius rushed to the garden where cosette was still walking cosette cosette he cried come come quick let us go basque a carriage cosette come ah my
2301,god it was he who saved my life let us not lose a minute put on your shawl cosette thought him mad and obeyed he could not breathe he laid his hand on his heart to restrain its throbbing he paced back and forth with huge strides he embraced cosette ah cosette i am an unhappy wretch said he marius was bewildered he began to catch a glimpse in jean valjean of some indescribably lofty and melancholy figure an unheard of virtue supreme and sweet humble in its immensity appeared to him the convict was transfigured into christ marius was dazzled by this prodigy he did not know precisely what he beheld but it was grand in an instant a hackney carriage stood in front of the door marius helped cosette in and darted in himself driver said he rue de l'homme arme number the carriage drove off ah what happiness ejaculated cosette rue de l'homme arme i did not dare to speak to you of that we are going to see m jean thy father cosette thy father more than ever cosette i guess it you told me that you had never received the letter that i sent you
2302,by gavroche it must have fallen into his hands cosette he went to the barricade to save me as it is a necessity with him to be an angel he saved others also he saved javert he rescued me from that gulf to give me to you he carried me on his back through that frightful sewer ah i am a monster of ingratitude cosette after having been your providence he became mine just imagine there was a terrible quagmire enough to drown one a hundred times over to drown one in mire cosette he made me traverse it i was unconscious i saw nothing i heard nothing i could know nothing of my own adventure we are going to bring him back to take him with us whether he is willing or not he shall never leave us again if only he is at home provided only that we can find him i will pass the rest of my life in venerating him yes that is how it should be do you see cosette gavroche must have delivered my letter to him all is explained you understand cosette did not understand a word you are right she said to
2303,him meanwhile the carriage rolled on v a night behind which there is day jean valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door come in he said feebly the door opened cosette and marius made their appearance cosette rushed into the room marius remained on the threshold leaning against the jamb of the door cosette said jean valjean and he sat erect in his chair his arms outstretched and trembling haggard livid gloomy an immense joy in his eyes cosette stifling with emotion fell upon jean valjean's breast father said she jean valjean overcome stammered cosette she you madame it is thou ah my god and pressed close in cosette's arms he exclaimed it is thou thou art here thou dost pardon me then marius lowering his eyelids in order to keep his tears from flowing took a step forward and murmured between lips convulsively contracted to repress his sobs my father and you also you pardon me jean valjean said to him marius could find no words and jean valjean added thanks cosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed it embarrasses me said she and seating herself on the old
2304,man's knees she put aside his white locks with an adorable movement and kissed his brow jean valjean bewildered let her have her own way cosette who only understood in a very confused manner redoubled her caresses as though she desired to pay marius debt jean valjean stammered how stupid people are i thought that i should never see her again imagine monsieur pontmercy at the very moment when you entered i was saying to myself all is over here is her little gown i am a miserable man i shall never see cosette again and i was saying that at the very moment when you were mounting the stairs was not i an idiot just see how idiotic one can be one reckons without the good god the good god says you fancy that you are about to be abandoned stupid no no things will not go so come there is a good man yonder who is in need of an angel and the angel comes and one sees one's cosette again and one sees one's little cosette once more ah i was very unhappy for a moment he could not speak then he went on i really needed
2305,to see cosette a little bit now and then a heart needs a bone to gnaw but i was perfectly conscious that i was in the way i gave myself reasons they do not want you keep in your own course one has not the right to cling eternally ah god be praised i see her once more dost thou know cosette thy husband is very handsome ah what a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on luckily i am fond of that pattern it was thy husband who chose it was it not and then thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls let me call her thou monsieur pontmercy it will not be for long and cosette began again how wicked of you to have left us like that where did you go why have you stayed away so long formerly your journeys only lasted three or four days i sent nicolette the answer always was he is absent how long have you been back why did you not let us know do you know that you are very much changed ah what a naughty father he has been ill and we have not known it stay marius feel how cold
2306,his hand is so you are here monsieur pontmercy you pardon me repeated jean valjean at that word which jean valjean had just uttered once more all that was swelling marius heart found vent he burst forth cosette do you hear he has come to that he asks my forgiveness and do you know what he has done for me cosette he has saved my life he has done more he has given you to me and after having saved me and after having given you to me cosette what has he done with himself he has sacrificed himself behold the man and he says to me the ingrate to me the forgetful to me the pitiless to me the guilty one thanks cosette my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too little that barricade that sewer that furnace that cesspool all that he traversed for me for thee cosette he carried me away through all the deaths which he put aside before me and accepted for himself every courage every virtue every heroism every sanctity he possesses cosette that man is an angel hush hush said jean valjean in a low voice why tell
2307,all that but you cried marius with a wrath in which there was veneration why did you not tell it to me it is your own fault too you save people's lives and you conceal it from them you do more under the pretext of unmasking yourself you calumniate yourself it is frightful i told the truth replied jean valjean no retorted marius the truth is the whole truth and that you did not tell you were monsieur madeleine why not have said so you saved javert why not have said so i owed my life to you why not have said so because i thought as you do i thought that you were in the right it was necessary that i should go away if you had known about that affair of the sewer you would have made me remain near you i was therefore forced to hold my peace if i had spoken it would have caused embarrassment in every way it would have embarrassed what embarrassed whom retorted marius do you think that you are going to stay here we shall carry you off ah good heavens when i reflect that it was by an accident that
2308,i have learned all this you form a part of ourselves you are her father and mine you shall not pass another day in this dreadful house do not imagine that you will be here to morrow to morrow said jean valjean i shall not be here but i shall not be with you what do you mean replied marius ah come now we are not going to permit any more journeys you shall never leave us again you belong to us we shall not loose our hold of you this time it is for good added cosette we have a carriage at the door i shall run away with you if necessary i shall employ force and she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms your chamber still stands ready in our house she went on if you only knew how pretty the garden is now the azaleas are doing very well there the walks are sanded with river sand there are tiny violet shells you shall eat my strawberries i water them myself and no more madame no more monsieur jean we are living under a republic everybody says thou don't they marius
2309,the programme is changed if you only knew father i have had a sorrow there was a robin redbreast which had made her nest in a hole in the wall and a horrible cat ate her my poor pretty little robin red breast which used to put her head out of her window and look at me i cried over it i should have liked to kill the cat but now nobody cries any more everybody laughs everybody is happy you are going to come with us how delighted grandfather will be you shall have your plot in the garden you shall cultivate it and we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine as mine and then i shall do everything that you wish and then you will obey me prettily jean valjean listened to her without hearing her he heard the music of her voice rather than the sense of her words one of those large tears which are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes he murmured the proof that god is good is that she is here father said cosette jean valjean continued it is quite true that it would be
2310,charming for us to live together their trees are full of birds i would walk with cosette it is sweet to be among living people who bid each other good day who call to each other in the garden people see each other from early morning we should each cultivate our own little corner she would make me eat her strawberries i would make her gather my roses that would be charming only he paused and said gently it is a pity the tear did not fall it retreated and jean valjean replaced it with a smile cosette took both the old man's hands in hers my god said she your hands are still colder than before are you ill do you suffer i no replied jean valjean i am very well only he paused only what i am going to die presently cosette and marius shuddered to die exclaimed marius yes but that is nothing said jean valjean he took breath smiled and resumed cosette thou wert talking to me go on so thy little robin red breast is dead speak so that i may hear thy voice marius gazed at the old man in amazement cosette uttered a
2311,heartrending cry father my father you will live you are going to live i insist upon your living do you hear jean valjean raised his head towards her with adoration oh yes forbid me to die who knows perhaps i shall obey i was on the verge of dying when you came that stopped me it seemed to me that i was born again you are full of strength and life cried marius do you imagine that a person can die like this you have had sorrow you shall have no more it is i who ask your forgiveness and on my knees you are going to live and to live with us and to live a long time we take possession of you once more there are two of us here who will henceforth have no other thought than your happiness you see resumed cosette all bathed in tears that marius says that you shall not die jean valjean continued to smile even if you were to take possession of me monsieur pontmercy would that make me other than i am no god has thought like you and myself and he does not change his mind it is useful
2312,for me to go death is a good arrangement god knows better than we what we need may you be happy may monsieur pontmercy have cosette may youth wed the morning may there be around you my children lilacs and nightingales may your life be a beautiful sunny lawn may all the enchantments of heaven fill your souls and now let me who am good for nothing die it is certain that all this is right come be reasonable nothing is possible now i am fully conscious that all is over and then last night i drank that whole jug of water how good thy husband is cosette thou art much better off with him than with me a noise became audible at the door it was the doctor entering good day and farewell doctor said jean valjean here are my poor children marius stepped up to the doctor he addressed to him only this single word monsieur but his manner of pronouncing it contained a complete question the doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance because things are not agreeable said jean valjean that is no reason for being unjust towards god a silence ensued all breasts
2313,were oppressed jean valjean turned to cosette he began to gaze at her as though he wished to retain her features for eternity in the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended ecstasy was still possible to him when gazing at cosette the reflection of that sweet face lighted up his pale visage the doctor felt of his pulse ah it was you that he wanted he murmured looking at cosette and marius and bending down to marius ear he added in a very low voice too late jean valjean surveyed the doctor and marius serenely almost without ceasing to gaze at cosette these barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth it is nothing to die it is dreadful not to live all at once he rose to his feet these accesses of strength are sometimes the sign of the death agony he walked with a firm step to the wall thrusting aside marius and the doctor who tried to help him detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended there and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of perfect health and said in a loud voice
2314,as he laid the crucifix on the table behold the great martyr then his chest sank in his head wavered as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him his hands which rested on his knees began to press their nails into the stuff of his trousers cosette supported his shoulders and sobbed and tried to speak to him but could not among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies tears they distinguished words like the following father do not leave us is it possible that we have found you only to lose you again it might be said that agony writhes it goes comes advances towards the sepulchre and returns towards life there is groping in the action of dying jean valjean rallied after this semi swoon shook his brow as though to make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid once more he took a fold of cosette's sleeve and kissed it he is coming back doctor he is coming back cried marius you are good both of you said jean valjean i am going to tell you what has caused me pain what has pained me monsieur pontmercy
2315,is that you have not been willing to touch that money that money really belongs to your wife i will explain to you my children and for that reason also i am glad to see you black jet comes from england white jet comes from norway all this is in this paper which you will read for bracelets i invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheet iron slides of iron laid together it is prettier better and less costly you will understand how much money can be made in that way so cosette's fortune is really hers i give you these details in order that your mind may be set at rest the portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the half open door the doctor dismissed her but he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying man before she disappeared would you like a priest i have had one replied jean valjean and with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where one would have said that he saw some one it is probable in fact that the bishop was present at this death agony cosette
2316,gently slipped a pillow under his loins jean valjean resumed have no fear monsieur pontmercy i adjure you the six hundred thousand francs really belong to cosette my life will have been wasted if you do not enjoy them we managed to do very well with those glass goods we rivalled what is called berlin jewellery however we could not equal the black glass of england a gross which contains twelve hundred very well cut grains only costs three francs when a being who is dear to us is on the point of death we gaze upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold him back cosette gave her hand to marius and both mute with anguish not knowing what to say to the dying man stood trembling and despairing before him jean valjean sank moment by moment he was failing he was drawing near to the gloomy horizon his breath had become intermittent a little rattling interrupted it he found some difficulty in moving his forearm his feet had lost all movement and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness of body increased all the majesty of his soul was
2317,displayed and spread over his brow the light of the unknown world was already visible in his eyes his face paled and smiled life was no longer there it was something else his breath sank his glance grew grander he was a corpse on which the wings could be felt he made a sign to cosette to draw near then to marius the last minute of the last hour had evidently arrived he began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come from a distance and one would have said that a wall now rose between them and him draw near draw near both of you i love you dearly oh how good it is to die like this and thou lovest me also my cosette i knew well that thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man how kind it was of thee to place that pillow under my loins thou wilt weep for me a little wilt thou not not too much i do not wish thee to have any real griefs you must enjoy yourselves a great deal my children i forgot to tell you that the profit was greater
2318,still on the buckles without tongues than on all the rest a gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs and sold for sixty it really was a good business so there is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs monsieur pontmercy it is honest money you may be rich with a tranquil mind thou must have a carriage a box at the theatres now and then and handsome ball dresses my cosette and then thou must give good dinners to thy friends and be very happy i was writing to cosette a while ago she will find my letter i bequeath to her the two candlesticks which stand on the chimney piece they are of silver but to me they are gold they are diamonds they change candles which are placed in them into wax tapers i do not know whether the person who gave them to me is pleased with me yonder on high i have done what i could my children you will not forget that i am a poor man you will have me buried in the first plot of earth that you find under a stone to mark the spot this is
2319,my wish no name on the stone if cosette cares to come for a little while now and then it will give me pleasure and you too monsieur pontmercy i must admit that i have not always loved you i ask your pardon for that now she and you form but one for me i feel very grateful to you i am sure that you make cosette happy if you only knew monsieur pontmercy her pretty rosy cheeks were my delight when i saw her in the least pale i was sad in the chest of drawers there is a bank bill for five hundred francs i have not touched it it is for the poor cosette dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed dost thou recognize it that was ten years ago however how time flies we have been very happy all is over do not weep my children i am not going very far i shall see you from there you will only have to look at night and you will see me smile cosette dost thou remember montfermeil thou wert in the forest thou wert greatly terrified dost thou remember how i took hold
2320,of the handle of the water bucket that was the first time that i touched thy poor little hand it was so cold ah your hands were red then mademoiselle they are very white now and the big doll dost thou remember thou didst call her catherine thou regrettedest not having taken her to the convent how thou didst make me laugh sometimes my sweet angel when it had been raining thou didst float bits of straw on the gutters and watch them pass away one day i gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow blue and green feathers thou hast forgotten it thou wert roguish so young thou didst play thou didst put cherries in thy ears those are things of the past the forests through which one has passed with one's child the trees under which one has strolled the convents where one has concealed oneself the games the hearty laughs of childhood are shadows i imagined that all that belonged to me in that lay my stupidity those thenardiers were wicked thou must forgive them cosette the moment has come to tell thee the name of thy mother she was called fantine remember that
2321,name fantine kneel whenever thou utterest it she suffered much she loved thee dearly she had as much unhappiness as thou hast had happiness that is the way god apportions things he is there on high he sees us all and he knows what he does in the midst of his great stars i am on the verge of departure my children love each other well and always there is nothing else but that in the world love for each other you will think sometimes of the poor old man who died here oh my cosette it is not my fault indeed that i have not seen thee all this time it cut me to the heart i went as far as the corner of the street i must have produced a queer effect on the people who saw me pass i was like a madman i once went out without my hat i no longer see clearly my children i had still other things to say but never mind think a little of me come still nearer i die happy give me your dear and well beloved heads so that i may lay my hands upon them cosette and
2322,marius fell on their knees in despair suffocating with tears each beneath one of jean valjean's hands those august hands no longer moved he had fallen backwards the light of the candles illuminated him his white face looked up to heaven he allowed cosette and marius to cover his hands with kisses he was dead the night was starless and extremely dark no doubt in the gloom some immense angel stood erect with wings outspread awaiting that soul vi the grass covers and the rain effaces in the cemetery of pere lachaise in the vicinity of the common grave far from the elegant quarter of that city of sepulchres far from all the tombs of fancy which display in the presence of eternity all the hideous fashions of death in a deserted corner beside an old wall beneath a great yew tree over which climbs the wild convolvulus amid dandelions and mosses there lies a stone that stone is no more exempt than others from the leprosy of time of dampness of the lichens and from the defilement of the birds the water turns it green the air blackens it it is not near any path and people are not
2323,fond of walking in that direction because the grass is high and their feet are immediately wet when there is a little sunshine the lizards come thither all around there is a quivering of weeds in the spring linnets warble in the trees this stone is perfectly plain in cutting it the only thought was the requirements of the tomb and no other care was taken than to make the stone long enough and narrow enough to cover a man no name is to be read there only many years ago a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines which have become gradually illegible beneath the rain and the dust and which are to day probably effaced il dort quoique le sort fut pour lui bien etrange il vivait il mourut quand il n'eut plus son ange la chose simplement d'elle meme arriva comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s'en va letter to m daelli publisher of the italian translation of in milan hauteville house october you are right sir when you tell me that is written for all nations i do not know whether it will be read by all but i wrote it for
2324,all it is addressed to england as well as to spain to italy as well as to france to germany as well as to ireland to republics which have slaves as well as to empires which have serfs social problems overstep frontiers the sores of the human race those great sores which cover the globe do not halt at the red or blue lines traced upon the map in every place where man is ignorant and despairing in every place where woman is sold for bread wherever the child suffers for lack of the book which should instruct him and of the hearth which should warm him the book of knocks at the door and says open to me i come for you at the hour of civilization through which we are now passing and which is still so sombre the miserable's name is man he is agonizing in all climes and he is groaning in all languages your italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our france your admirable italy has all miseries on the face of it does not banditism that raging form of pauperism inhabit your mountains few nations are more deeply eaten by
2325,that ulcer of convents which i have endeavored to fathom in spite of your possessing rome milan naples palermo turin florence sienna pisa mantua bologna ferrara genoa venice a heroic history sublime ruins magnificent ruins and superb cities you are like ourselves poor you are covered with marvels and vermin assuredly the sun of italy is splendid but alas azure in the sky does not prevent rags on man like us you have prejudices superstitions tyrannies fanaticisms blind laws lending assistance to ignorant customs you taste nothing of the present nor of the future without a flavor of the past being mingled with it you have a barbarian the monk and a savage the lazzarone the social question is the same for you as for us there are a few less deaths from hunger with you and a few more from fever your social hygiene is not much better than ours shadows which are protestant in england are catholic in italy but under different names the vescovo is identical with the bishop and it always means night and of pretty nearly the same quality to explain the bible badly amounts to the same thing as to understand the gospel badly
2326,is it necessary to emphasize this must this melancholy parallelism be yet more completely verified have you not indigent persons glance below have you not parasites glance up does not that hideous balance whose two scales pauperism and parasitism so mournfully preserve their mutual equilibrium oscillate before you as it does before us where is your army of schoolmasters the only army which civilization acknowledges where are your free and compulsory schools does every one know how to read in the land of dante and of michael angelo have you made public schools of your barracks have you not like ourselves an opulent war budget and a paltry budget of education have not you also that passive obedience which is so easily converted into soldierly obedience military establishment which pushes the regulations to the extreme of firing upon garibaldi that is to say upon the living honor of italy let us subject your social order to examination let us take it where it stands and as it stands let us view its flagrant offences show me the woman and the child it is by the amount of protection with which these two feeble creatures are surrounded that the degree of
2327,civilization is to be measured is prostitution less heartrending in naples than in paris what is the amount of truth that springs from your laws and what amount of justice springs from your tribunals do you chance to be so fortunate as to be ignorant of the meaning of those gloomy words public prosecution legal infamy prison the scaffold the executioner the death penalty italians with you as with us beccaria is dead and farinace is alive and then let us scrutinize your state reasons have you a government which comprehends the identity of morality and politics you have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes something very similar has been done in france stay let us pass miseries in review let each one contribute his pile you are as rich as we have you not like ourselves two condemnations religious condemnation pronounced by the priest and social condemnation decreed by the judge oh great nation of italy thou resemblest the great nation of france alas our brothers you are like ourselves miserables from the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell you do not see much more distinctly than we the radiant and distant portals of eden
2328,only the priests are mistaken these holy portals are before and not behind us i resume this book is no less your mirror than ours certain men certain castes rise in revolt against this book i understand that mirrors those revealers of the truth are hated that does not prevent them from being of use as for myself i have written for all with a profound love for my own country but without being engrossed by france more than by any other nation in proportion as i advance in life i grow more simple and i become more and more patriotic for humanity this is moreover the tendency of our age and the law of radiance of the french revolution books must cease to be exclusively french italian german spanish or english and become european i say more human if they are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization hence a new logic of art and of certain requirements of composition which modify everything even the conditions formerly narrow of taste and language which must grow broader like all the rest in france certain critics have reproached me to my great delight with having transgressed the bounds of what they
2329,call french taste i should be glad if this eulogium were merited in short i am doing what i can i suffer with the same universal suffering and i try to assuage it i possess only the puny forces of a man and i cry to all help me this sir is what your letter prompts me to say i say it for you and for your country if i have insisted so strongly it is because of one phrase in your letter you write there are italians and they are numerous who say this book les miserables is a french book it does not concern us let the french read it as a history we read it as a romance alas i repeat whether we be italians or frenchmen misery concerns us all ever since history has been written ever since philosophy has meditated misery has been the garment of the human race the moment has at length arrived for tearing off that rag and for replacing upon the naked limbs of the man people the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robe of the dawn if this letter seems to you of service in enlightening
