1357,which resembled that of a cupboard being opened and then shut again then a piece of furniture was disarranged then a pause ensued then the step began again the cashier sat up in bed quite awake now and staring and through his window panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted window reflected on the opposite wall from the direction of the rays it could only come from the window of m madeleine's chamber the reflection wavered as though it came rather from a fire which had been lighted than from a candle the shadow of the window frame was not shown which indicated that the window was wide open the fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surprising the cashier fell asleep again an hour or two later he waked again the same step was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead the reflection was still visible on the wall but now it was pale and peaceful like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle the window was still open this is what had taken place in m madeleine's room iii a tempest in a skull the reader has no,LM

1365,javert the first thought which occurred to him was to go to run and denounce himself to take that champmathieu out of prison and place himself there this was as painful and as poignant as an incision in the living flesh then it passed away and he said to himself we will see we will see he repressed this first generous instinct and recoiled before heroism it would be beautiful no doubt after the bishop's holy words after so many years of repentance and abnegation in the midst of a penitence admirably begun if this man had not flinched for an instant even in the presence of so terrible a conjecture but had continued to walk with the same step towards this yawning precipice at the bottom of which lay heaven that would have been beautiful but it was not thus we must render an account of the things which went on in this soul and we can only tell what there was there he was carried away at first by the instinct of self preservation he rallied all his ideas in haste stifled his emotions took into consideration javert's presence that great danger postponed all decision with the firmness,LM
1366,of terror shook off thought as to what he had to do and resumed his calmness as a warrior picks up his buckler he remained in this state during the rest of the day a whirlwind within a profound tranquillity without he took no preservative measures as they may be called everything was still confused and jostling together in his brain his trouble was so great that he could not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly and he could have told nothing about himself except that he had received a great blow he repaired to fantine's bed of suffering as usual and prolonged his visit through a kindly instinct telling himself that he must behave thus and recommend her well to the sisters in case he should be obliged to be absent himself he had a vague feeling that he might be obliged to go to arras and without having the least in the world made up his mind to this trip he said to himself that being as he was beyond the shadow of any suspicion there could be nothing out of the way in being a witness to what was to take place and he engaged,LM
1367,the tilbury from scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event he dined with a good deal of appetite on returning to his room he communed with himself he examined the situation and found it unprecedented so unprecedented that in the midst of his revery he rose from his chair moved by some inexplicable impulse of anxiety and bolted his door he feared lest something more should enter he was barricading himself against possibilities a moment later he extinguished his light it embarrassed him it seemed to him as though he might be seen by whom alas that on which he desired to close the door had already entered that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face his conscience his conscience that is to say god nevertheless he deluded himself at first he had a feeling of security and of solitude the bolt once drawn he thought himself impregnable the candle extinguished he felt himself invisible then he took possession of himself he set his elbows on the table leaned his head on his hand and began to meditate in the dark where do i stand am not i dreaming what have i heard is,LM
1368,it really true that i have seen that javert and that he spoke to me in that manner who can that champmathieu be so he resembles me is it possible when i reflect that yesterday i was so tranquil and so far from suspecting anything what was i doing yesterday at this hour what is there in this incident what will the end be what is to be done this was the torment in which he found himself his brain had lost its power of retaining ideas they passed like waves and he clutched his brow in both hands to arrest them nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmed his will and his reason and from which he sought to draw proof and resolution his head was burning he went to the window and threw it wide open there were no stars in the sky he returned and seated himself at the table the first hour passed in this manner gradually however vague outlines began to take form and to fix themselves in his meditation and he was able to catch a glimpse with precision of the reality not the whole situation but some of the details,LM
1369,he began by recognizing the fact that critical and extraordinary as was this situation he was completely master of it this only caused an increase of his stupor independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to his actions all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a hole in which to bury his name that which he had always feared most of all in his hours of self communion during his sleepless nights was to ever hear that name pronounced he had said to himself that that would be the end of all things for him that on the day when that name made its reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him and who knows perhaps even his new soul within him also he shuddered at the very thought that this was possible assuredly if any one had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that name would ring in his ears when the hideous words jean valjean would suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him when that formidable light capable of dissipating the mystery in which,LM
1370,he had enveloped himself would suddenly blaze forth above his head and that that name would not menace him that that light would but produce an obscurity more dense that this rent veil would but increase the mystery that this earthquake would solidify his edifice that this prodigious incident would have no other result so far as he was concerned if so it seemed good to him than that of rendering his existence at once clearer and more impenetrable and that out of his confrontation with the phantom of jean valjean the good and worthy citizen monsieur madeleine would emerge more honored more peaceful and more respected than ever if any one had told him that he would have tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman well all this was precisely what had just come to pass all that accumulation of impossibilities was a fact and god had permitted these wild fancies to become real things his revery continued to grow clearer he came more and more to an understanding of his position it seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicable dream and that he found himself slipping down,LM
1371,a declivity in the middle of the night erect shivering holding back all in vain on the very brink of the abyss he distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger a man unknown to him whom destiny had mistaken for him and whom she was thrusting into the gulf in his stead in order that the gulf might close once more it was necessary that some one himself or that other man should fall into it he had only let things take their course the light became complete and he acknowledged this to himself that his place was empty in the galleys that do what he would it was still awaiting him that the theft from little gervais had led him back to it that this vacant place would await him and draw him on until he filled it that this was inevitable and fatal and then he said to himself that at this moment he had a substitute that it appeared that a certain champmathieu had that ill luck and that as regards himself being present in the galleys in the person of that champmathieu present in society under the name of m madeleine he had nothing more to,LM
1372,fear provided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the head of that champmathieu this stone of infamy which like the stone of the sepulchre falls once never to rise again all this was so strange and so violent that there suddenly took place in him that indescribable movement which no man feels more than two or three times in the course of his life a sort of convulsion of the conscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart which is composed of irony of joy and of despair and which may be called an outburst of inward laughter he hastily relighted his candle well what then he said to himself what am i afraid of what is there in all that for me to think about i am safe all is over i had but one partly open door through which my past might invade my life and behold that door is walled up forever that javert who has been annoying me so long that terrible instinct which seemed to have divined me which had divined me good god and which followed me everywhere that frightful hunting dog always making a point at,LM
1373,me is thrown off the scent engaged elsewhere absolutely turned from the trail henceforth he is satisfied he will leave me in peace he has his jean valjean who knows it is even probable that he will wish to leave town and all this has been brought about without any aid from me and i count for nothing in it ah but where is the misfortune in this upon my honor people would think to see me that some catastrophe had happened to me after all if it does bring harm to some one that is not my fault in the least it is providence which has done it all it is because it wishes it so to be evidently have i the right to disarrange what it has arranged what do i ask now why should i meddle it does not concern me what i am not satisfied but what more do i want the goal to which i have aspired for so many years the dream of my nights the object of my prayers to heaven security i have now attained it is god who wills it i can do nothing against the will of god and why,LM
1374,does god will it in order that i may continue what i have begun that i may do good that i may one day be a grand and encouraging example that it may be said at last that a little happiness has been attached to the penance which i have undergone and to that virtue to which i have returned really i do not understand why i was afraid a little while ago to enter the house of that good cure and to ask his advice this is evidently what he would have said to me it is settled let things take their course let the good god do as he likes thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience bending over what may be called his own abyss he rose from his chair and began to pace the room come said he let us think no more about it my resolve is taken but he felt no joy quite the reverse one can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can the sea from returning to the shore the sailor calls it the tide the guilty man calls it remorse god,LM
1375,upheaves the soul as he does the ocean after the expiration of a few moments do what he would he resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened saying that which he would have preferred to ignore and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear yielding to that mysterious power which said to him think as it said to another condemned man two thousand years ago march on before proceeding further and in order to make ourselves fully understood let us insist upon one necessary observation it is certain that people do talk to themselves there is no living being who has not done it it may even be said that the word is never a more magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to conscience within a man and when it returns from conscience to thought it is in this sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter he said he exclaimed must be understood one speaks to one's self talks to one's self exclaims to one's self without breaking the external silence there is a great tumult everything about us talks except the,LM
1376,mouth the realities of the soul are none the less realities because they are not visible and palpable so he asked himself where he stood he interrogated himself upon that settled resolve he confessed to himself that all that he had just arranged in his mind was monstrous that to let things take their course to let the good god do as he liked was simply horrible to allow this error of fate and of men to be carried out not to hinder it to lend himself to it through his silence to do nothing in short was to do everything that this was hypocritical baseness in the last degree that it was a base cowardly sneaking abject hideous crime for the first time in eight years the wretched man had just tasted the bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action he spit it out with disgust he continued to question himself he asked himself severely what he had meant by this my object is attained he declared to himself that his life really had an object but what object to conceal his name to deceive the police was it for so petty a thing that,LM
1377,he had done all that he had done had he not another and a grand object which was the true one to save not his person but his soul to become honest and good once more to be a just man was it not that above all that alone which he had always desired which the bishop had enjoined upon him to shut the door on his past but he was not shutting it great god he was re opening it by committing an infamous action he was becoming a thief once more and the most odious of thieves he was robbing another of his existence his life his peace his place in the sunshine he was becoming an assassin he was murdering morally murdering a wretched man he was inflicting on him that frightful living death that death beneath the open sky which is called the galleys on the other hand to surrender himself to save that man struck down with so melancholy an error to resume his own name to become once more out of duty the convict jean valjean that was in truth to achieve his resurrection and to close forever that hell whence he had just,LM
1378,emerged to fall back there in appearance was to escape from it in reality this must be done he had done nothing if he did not do all this his whole life was useless all his penitence was wasted there was no longer any need of saying what is the use he felt that the bishop was there that the bishop was present all the more because he was dead that the bishop was gazing fixedly at him that henceforth mayor madeleine with all his virtues would be abominable to him and that the convict jean valjean would be pure and admirable in his sight that men beheld his mask but that the bishop saw his face that men saw his life but that the bishop beheld his conscience so he must go to arras deliver the false jean valjean and denounce the real one alas that was the greatest of sacrifices the most poignant of victories the last step to take but it must be done sad fate he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of god when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men well said he let us decide upon this let us,LM
1379,do our duty let us save this man he uttered these words aloud without perceiving that he was speaking aloud he took his books verified them and put them in order he flung in the fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed tradesmen he wrote and sealed a letter and on the envelope it might have been read had there been any one in his chamber at the moment to monsieur laffitte banker rue d'artois paris he drew from his secretary a pocket book which contained several bank notes and the passport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the elections any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts into which there entered such grave thought would have had no suspicion of what was going on within him only occasionally did his lips move at other times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of the wall as though there existed at that point something which he wished to elucidate or interrogate when he had finished the letter to m laffitte he put it into his pocket together with the,LM

1390,it turns out that some one is jean valjean at the present moment let him look out for himself that does not concern me it is a fatal name which was floating abroad in the night if it halts and descends on a head so much the worse for that head he looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney piece and said hold it has relieved me to come to a decision i am quite another man now he proceeded a few paces further then he stopped short come he said i must not flinch before any of the consequences of the resolution which i have once adopted there are still threads which attach me to that jean valjean they must be broken in this very room there are objects which would betray me dumb things which would bear witness against me it is settled all these things must disappear he fumbled in his pocket drew out his purse opened it and took out a small key he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly be seen so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design which covered the wall paper,LM
1391,a secret receptacle opened a sort of false cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the chimney piece in this hiding place there were some rags a blue linen blouse an old pair of trousers an old knapsack and a huge thorn cudgel shod with iron at both ends those who had seen jean valjean at the epoch when he passed through d in october could easily have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit he had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks in order to remind himself continually of his starting point but he had concealed all that came from the galleys and he had allowed the candlesticks which came from the bishop to be seen he cast a furtive glance towards the door as though he feared that it would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it then with a quick and abrupt movement he took the whole in his arms at once without bestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously and so perilously preserved for so many years and flung them all rags cudgel knapsack into the fire he closed the false,LM
1392,cupboard again and with redoubled precautions henceforth unnecessary since it was now empty he concealed the door behind a heavy piece of furniture which he pushed in front of it after the lapse of a few seconds the room and the opposite wall were lighted up with a fierce red tremulous glow everything was on fire the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the chamber as the knapsack was consumed together with the hideous rags which it contained it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes by bending over one could have readily recognized a coin no doubt the forty sou piece stolen from the little savoyard he did not look at the fire but paced back and forth with the same step all at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks which shone vaguely on the chimney piece through the glow hold he thought the whole of jean valjean is still in them they must be destroyed also he seized the two candlesticks there was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal he bent over the hearth,LM
1393,and warmed himself for a moment he felt a sense of real comfort how good warmth is said he he stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks a minute more and they were both in the fire at that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him shouting jean valjean jean valjean his hair rose upright he became like a man who is listening to some terrible thing yes that's it finish said the voice complete what you are about destroy these candlesticks annihilate this souvenir forget the bishop forget everything destroy this champmathieu do that is right applaud yourself so it is settled resolved fixed agreed here is an old man who does not know what is wanted of him who has perhaps done nothing an innocent man whose whole misfortune lies in your name upon whom your name weighs like a crime who is about to be taken for you who will be condemned who will finish his days in abjectness and horror that is good be an honest man yourself remain monsieur le maire remain honorable and honored enrich the town nourish the indigent rear the orphan live happy virtuous and,LM
1394,admired and during this time while you are here in the midst of joy and light there will be a man who will wear your red blouse who will bear your name in ignominy and who will drag your chain in the galleys yes it is well arranged thus ah wretch the perspiration streamed from his brow he fixed a haggard eye on the candlesticks but that within him which had spoken had not finished the voice continued jean valjean there will be around you many voices which will make a great noise which will talk very loud and which will bless you and only one which no one will hear and which will curse you in the dark well listen infamous man all those benedictions will fall back before they reach heaven and only the malediction will ascend to god this voice feeble at first and which had proceeded from the most obscure depths of his conscience had gradually become startling and formidable and he now heard it in his very ear it seemed to him that it had detached itself from him and that it was now speaking outside of him he thought that he heard the last,LM
1395,words so distinctly that he glanced around the room in a sort of terror is there any one here he demanded aloud in utter bewilderment then he resumed with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot how stupid i am there can be no one there was some one but the person who was there was of those whom the human eye cannot see he placed the candlesticks on the chimney piece then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp which troubled the dreams of the sleeping man beneath him and awoke him with a start this tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him it sometimes seems on supreme occasions as though people moved about for the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter by change of place after the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew his position he now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he had arrived in turn the two ideas which counselled him appeared to him equally fatal what a fatality what conjunction that that champmathieu should have been taken for him to be overwhelmed by precisely the means which,LM
1396,providence seemed to have employed at first to strengthen his position there was a moment when he reflected on the future denounce himself great god deliver himself up with immense despair he faced all that he should be obliged to leave all that he should be obliged to take up once more he should have to bid farewell to that existence which was so good so pure so radiant to the respect of all to honor to liberty he should never more stroll in the fields he should never more hear the birds sing in the month of may he should never more bestow alms on the little children he should never more experience the sweetness of having glances of gratitude and love fixed upon him he should quit that house which he had built that little chamber everything seemed charming to him at that moment never again should he read those books never more should he write on that little table of white wood his old portress the only servant whom he kept would never more bring him his coffee in the morning great god instead of that the convict gang the iron necklet the red waistcoat the chain,LM
1397,on his ankle fatigue the cell the camp bed all those horrors which he knew so well at his age after having been what he was if he were only young again but to be addressed in his old age as thou by any one who pleased to be searched by the convict guard to receive the galley sergeant's cudgellings to wear iron bound shoes on his bare feet to have to stretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of the roundsman who visits the gang to submit to the curiosity of strangers who would be told that man yonder is the famous jean valjean who was mayor of m sur m and at night dripping with perspiration overwhelmed with lassitude their green caps drawn over their eyes to remount two by two the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the sergeant's whip oh what misery can destiny then be as malicious as an intelligent being and become as monstrous as the human heart and do what he would he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma which lay at the foundation of his revery should he remain in paradise and become a demon should he return,LM
1398,to hell and become an angel what was to be done great god what was to be done the torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was unchained afresh within him his ideas began to grow confused once more they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiar to despair the name of romainville recurred incessantly to his mind with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past he thought that romainville was a little grove near paris where young lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of april he wavered outwardly as well as inwardly he walked like a little child who is permitted to toddle alone at intervals as he combated his lassitude he made an effort to recover the mastery of his mind he tried to put to himself for the last time and definitely the problem over which he had in a manner fallen prostrate with fatigue ought he to denounce himself ought he to hold his peace he could not manage to see anything distinctly the vague aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by his meditations quivered,LM
1399,and vanished one after the other into smoke he only felt that to whatever course of action he made up his mind something in him must die and that of necessity and without his being able to escape the fact that he was entering a sepulchre on the right hand as much as on the left that he was passing through a death agony the agony of his happiness or the agony of his virtue alas all his resolution had again taken possession of him he was no further advanced than at the beginning thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish eighteen hundred years before this unfortunate man the mysterious being in whom are summed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had also long thrust aside with his hand while the olive trees quivered in the wild wind of the infinite the terrible cup which appeared to him dripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all studded with stars iv forms assumed by suffering during sleep three o'clock in the morning had just struck and he had been walking thus for five hours almost uninterruptedly when he at length allowed himself,LM
1400,to drop into his chair there he fell asleep and had a dream this dream like the majority of dreams bore no relation to the situation except by its painful and heart rending character but it made an impression on him this nightmare struck him so forcibly that he wrote it down later on it is one of the papers in his own handwriting which he has bequeathed to us we think that we have here reproduced the thing in strict accordance with the text of whatever nature this dream may be the history of this night would be incomplete if we were to omit it it is the gloomy adventure of an ailing soul here it is on the envelope we find this line inscribed the dream i had that night i was in a plain a vast gloomy plain where there was no grass it did not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night i was walking with my brother the brother of my childish years the brother of whom i must say i never think and whom i now hardly remember we were conversing and we met some passers by we were talking of a,LM
1401,neighbor of ours in former days who had always worked with her window open from the time when she came to live on the street as we talked we felt cold because of that open window there were no trees in the plain we saw a man passing close to us he was entirely nude of the hue of ashes and mounted on a horse which was earth color the man had no hair we could see his skull and the veins on it in his hand he held a switch which was as supple as a vine shoot and as heavy as iron this horseman passed and said nothing to us my brother said to me let us take to the hollow road there existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub nor a spear of moss everything was dirt colored even the sky after proceeding a few paces i received no reply when i spoke i perceived that my brother was no longer with me i entered a village which i espied i reflected that it must be romainville why romainville the first street that i entered was deserted i entered a second street behind,LM
1402,the angle formed by the two streets a man was standing erect against the wall i said to this man what country is this where am i the man made no reply i saw the door of a house open and i entered the first chamber was deserted i entered the second behind the door of this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall i inquired of this man whose house is this where am i the man replied not the house had a garden i quitted the house and entered the garden the garden was deserted behind the first tree i found a man standing upright i said to this man what garden is this where am i the man did not answer i strolled into the village and perceived that it was a town all the streets were deserted all the doors were open not a single living being was passing in the streets walking through the chambers or strolling in the gardens but behind each angle of the walls behind each door behind each tree stood a silent man only one was to be seen at a time these men watched me pass i left,LM
1403,the town and began to ramble about the fields after the lapse of some time i turned back and saw a great crowd coming up behind me i recognized all the men whom i had seen in that town they had strange heads they did not seem to be in a hurry yet they walked faster than i did they made no noise as they walked in an instant this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me the faces of these men were earthen in hue then the first one whom i had seen and questioned on entering the town said to me whither are you going do you not know that you have been dead this long time i opened my mouth to reply and i perceived that there was no one near me he woke he was icy cold a wind which was chill like the breeze of dawn was rattling the leaves of the window which had been left open on their hinges the fire was out the candle was nearing its end it was still black night he rose he went to the window there were no stars in the sky even yet from his window the,LM
1404,yard of the house and the street were visible a sharp harsh noise which made him drop his eyes resounded from the earth below him he perceived two red stars whose rays lengthened and shortened in a singular manner through the darkness as his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep hold said he there are no stars in the sky they are on earth now but this confusion vanished a second sound similar to the first roused him thoroughly he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage by the light which they cast he was able to distinguish the form of this vehicle it was a tilbury harnessed to a small white horse the noise which he had heard was the trampling of the horse's hoofs on the pavement what vehicle is this he said to himself who is coming here so early in the morning at that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber he shuddered from head to foot and cried in a terrible voice who is there some one said i monsieur le maire he recognized the voice of the,LM
1405,old woman who was his portress well he replied what is it monsieur le maire it is just five o'clock in the morning what is that to me the cabriolet is here monsieur le maire what cabriolet the tilbury what tilbury did not monsieur le maire order a tilbury no said he the coachman says that he has come for monsieur le maire what coachman m scaufflaire's coachman m scaufflaire that name sent a shudder over him as though a flash of lightning had passed in front of his face ah yes he resumed m scaufflaire if the old woman could have seen him at that moment she would have been frightened a tolerably long silence ensued he examined the flame of the candle with a stupid air and from around the wick he took some of the burning wax which he rolled between his fingers the old woman waited for him she even ventured to uplift her voice once more what am i to say monsieur le maire say that it is well and that i am coming down v hindrances the posting service from arras to m sur m was still operated at this period by small mail,LM
1406,wagons of the time of the empire these mail wagons were two wheeled cabriolets upholstered inside with fawn colored leather hung on springs and having but two seats one for the postboy the other for the traveller the wheels were armed with those long offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance and which may still be seen on the road in germany the despatch box an immense oblong coffer was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it this coffer was painted black and the cabriolet yellow these vehicles which have no counterparts nowadays had something distorted and hunchbacked about them and when one saw them passing in the distance and climbing up some road to the horizon they resembled the insects which are called i think termites and which though with but little corselet drag a great train behind them but they travelled at a very rapid rate the post wagon which set out from arras at one o'clock every night after the mail from paris had passed arrived at m sur m a little before five o'clock in the morning that night the wagon which was descending to m sur m by the hesdin,LM
1407,road collided at the corner of a street just as it was entering the town with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse which was going in the opposite direction and in which there was but one person a man enveloped in a mantle the wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent shock the postman shouted to the man to stop but the traveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop that man is in a devilish hurry said the postman the man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity whither was he going he could not have told why was he hastening he did not know he was driving at random straight ahead whither to arras no doubt but he might have been going elsewhere as well at times he was conscious of it and he shuddered he plunged into the night as into a gulf something urged him forward something drew him on no one could have told what was taking place within him every one will understand it what man is there who has not entered at least once,LM
1408,in his life into that obscure cavern of the unknown however he had resolved on nothing decided nothing formed no plan done nothing none of the actions of his conscience had been decisive he was more than ever as he had been at the first moment why was he going to arras he repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired scaufflaire's cabriolet that whatever the result was to be there was no reason why he should not see with his own eyes and judge of matters for himself that this was even prudent that he must know what took place that no decision could be arrived at without having observed and scrutinized that one made mountains out of everything from a distance that at any rate when he should have seen that champmathieu some wretch his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him to go to the galleys in his stead that javert would indeed be there and that brevet that chenildieu that cochepaille old convicts who had known him but they certainly would not recognize him bah what an idea that javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth that all,LM
1409,conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on champmathieu and that there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures that accordingly there was no danger that it was no doubt a dark moment but that he should emerge from it that after all he held his destiny however bad it might be in his own hand that he was master of it he clung to this thought at bottom to tell the whole truth he would have preferred not to go to arras nevertheless he was going thither as he meditated he whipped up his horse which was proceeding at that fine regular and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half an hour in proportion as the cabriolet advanced he felt something within him draw back at daybreak he was in the open country the town of m sur m lay far behind him he watched the horizon grow white he stared at all the chilly figures of a winter's dawn as they passed before his eyes but without seeing them the morning has its spectres as well as the evening he did not see them but without his being aware of it and by means of a,LM
1410,sort of penetration which was almost physical these black silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality to the violent state of his soul each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes border on the highway he said to himself and yet there are people there within who are sleeping the trot of the horse the bells on the harness the wheels on the road produced a gentle monotonous noise these things are charming when one is joyous and lugubrious when one is sad it was broad daylight when he arrived at hesdin he halted in front of the inn to allow the horse a breathing spell and to have him given some oats the horse belonged as scaufflaire had said to that small race of the boulonnais which has too much head too much belly and not enough neck and shoulders but which has a broad chest a large crupper thin fine legs and solid hoofs a homely but a robust and healthy race the excellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours and had not a drop of sweat on his loins he did not get out of the,LM
1411,tilbury the stableman who brought the oats suddenly bent down and examined the left wheel are you going far in this condition said the man he replied with an air of not having roused himself from his revery why have you come from a great distance went on the man five leagues ah why do you say ah the man bent down once more was silent for a moment with his eyes fixed on the wheel then he rose erect and said because though this wheel has travelled five leagues it certainly will not travel another quarter of a league he sprang out of the tilbury what is that you say my friend i say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues without you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway just see here the wheel really had suffered serious damage the shock administered by the mail wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub so that the nut no longer held firm my friend he said to the stableman is there a wheelwright here certainly sir do me the service to go and fetch him he is only a step,LM
1412,from here hey master bourgaillard master bourgaillard the wheelwright was standing on his own threshold he came examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken can you repair this wheel immediately yes sir when can i set out again to morrow to morrow there is a long day's work on it are you in a hurry sir in a very great hurry i must set out again in an hour at the latest impossible sir i will pay whatever you ask impossible well in two hours then impossible to day two new spokes and a hub must be made monsieur will not be able to start before to morrow morning the matter cannot wait until to morrow what if you were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it how so you are a wheelwright certainly sir have you not a wheel that you can sell me then i could start again at once a spare wheel yes i have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet two wheels make a pair two wheels cannot be put together hap hazard in that case sell me a pair of,LM
1413,wheels not all wheels fit all axles sir try nevertheless it is useless sir i have nothing to sell but cart wheels we are but a poor country here have you a cabriolet that you can let me have the wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle he shrugged his shoulders you treat the cabriolets that people let you so well if i had one i would not let it to you well sell it to me then i have none what not even a spring cart i am not hard to please as you see we live in a poor country there is in truth added the wheelwright an old calash under the shed yonder which belongs to a bourgeois of the town who gave it to me to take care of and who only uses it on the thirty sixth of the month never that is to say i might let that to you for what matters it to me but the bourgeois must not see it pass and then it is a calash it would require two horses i will take two post horses where is monsieur going to arras,LM
1414,and monsieur wishes to reach there to day yes of course by taking two post horses why not does it make any difference whether monsieur arrives at four o'clock to morrow morning certainly not there is one thing to be said about that you see by taking post horses monsieur has his passport yes well by taking post horses monsieur cannot reach arras before to morrow we are on a cross road the relays are badly served the horses are in the fields the season for ploughing is just beginning heavy teams are required and horses are seized upon everywhere from the post as well as elsewhere monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay and then they drive at a walk there are many hills to ascend come then i will go on horseback unharness the cabriolet some one can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood without doubt but will this horse bear the saddle that is true you remind me of that he will not bear it then but i can surely hire a horse in the village a horse to travel to arras at one stretch yes that,LM
1415,would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts you would have to buy it to begin with because no one knows you but you will not find one for sale nor to let for five hundred francs or for a thousand what am i to do the best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man and set out on your journey to morrow to morrow will be too late the deuce is there not a mail wagon which runs to arras when will it pass to night both the posts pass at night the one going as well as the one coming what it will take you a day to mend this wheel a day and a good long one if you set two men to work if i set ten men to work what if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes that could be done with the spokes not with the hub and the felly is in a bad state too is there any one in this village who lets out teams no is there another wheelwright the stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert with a,LM
1416,toss of the head no he felt an immense joy it was evident that providence was intervening that it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road he had not yielded to this sort of first summons he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means he had been deterred neither by the season nor fatigue nor by the expense he had nothing with which to reproach himself if he went no further that was no fault of his it did not concern him further it was no longer his fault it was not the act of his own conscience but the act of providence he breathed again he breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungs for the first time since javert's visit it seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released him it seemed to him that god was for him now and was manifesting himself he said himself that he had done all he could and that now he,LM
1417,had nothing to do but retrace his steps quietly if his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn it would have had no witnesses no one would have heard him things would have rested there and it is probable that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about to peruse but this conversation had taken place in the street any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd there are always people who ask nothing better than to become spectators while he was questioning the wheelwright some people who were passing back and forth halted around them after listening for a few minutes a young lad to whom no one had paid any heed detached himself from the group and ran off at the moment when the traveller after the inward deliberation which we have just described resolved to retrace his steps this child returned he was accompanied by an old woman monsieur said the woman my boy tells me that you wish to hire a cabriolet these simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the perspiration trickle down his limbs,LM
1418,he thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him ready to seize him once more he answered yes my good woman i am in search of a cabriolet which i can hire and he hastened to add but there is none in the place certainly there is said the old woman where interpolated the wheelwright at my house replied the old woman he shuddered the fatal hand had grasped him again the old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring cart the wheelwright and the stable man in despair at the prospect of the traveller escaping their clutches interfered it was a frightful old trap it rests flat on the axle it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs the rain came into it the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture it would not go much further than the tilbury a regular ramshackle old stage wagon the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it etc etc all this was true but this trap this ramshackle old vehicle this thing whatever it was ran on,LM
1419,its two wheels and could go to arras he paid what was asked left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be repaired intending to reclaim it on his return had the white horse put to the cart climbed into it and resumed the road which he had been travelling since morning at the moment when the cart moved off he admitted that he had felt a moment previously a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding he examined this joy with a sort of wrath and found it absurd why should he feel joy at turning back after all he was taking this trip of his own free will no one was forcing him to it and assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose as he left hesdin he heard a voice shouting to him stop stop he halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope it was the old woman's little boy monsieur said the latter it was i who got the cart for you well you have not given me anything he who gave to all so readily thought this,LM
1420,demand exorbitant and almost odious ah it's you you scamp said he you shall have nothing he whipped up his horse and set off at full speed he had lost a great deal of time at hesdin he wanted to make it good the little horse was courageous and pulled for two but it was the month of february there had been rain the roads were bad and then it was no longer the tilbury the cart was very heavy and in addition there were many ascents he took nearly four hours to go from hesdin to saint pol four hours for five leagues at saint pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to and led to the stable as he had promised scaufflaire he stood beside the manger while the horse was eating he thought of sad and confusing things the inn keeper's wife came to the stable does not monsieur wish to breakfast come that is true i even have a good appetite he followed the woman who had a rosy cheerful face she led him to the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth make haste said he i,LM
1421,must start again i am in a hurry a big flemish servant maid placed his knife and fork in all haste he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort that is what ailed me he thought i had not breakfasted his breakfast was served he seized the bread took a mouthful and then slowly replaced it on the table and did not touch it again a carter was eating at another table he said to this man why is their bread so bitter here the carter was a german and did not understand him he returned to the stable and remained near the horse an hour later he had quitted saint pol and was directing his course towards tinques which is only five leagues from arras what did he do during this journey of what was he thinking as in the morning he watched the trees the thatched roofs the tilled fields pass by and the way in which the landscape broken at every turn of the road vanished this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul and almost relieves it from thought what is more melancholy and more profound than to see a,LM
1422,thousand objects for the first and the last time to travel is to be born and to die at every instant perhaps in the vaguest region of his mind he did make comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us the dark and bright intervals are intermingled after a dazzling moment an eclipse we look we hasten we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing each event is a turn in the road and all at once we are old we feel a shock all is black we distinguish an obscure door the gloomy horse of life which has been drawing us halts and we see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school beheld this traveller enter tinques it is true that the days were still short he did not halt at tinques as he emerged from the village a laborer who was mending the road with stones raised his head and said to him that horse is very much fatigued the poor beast was in fact going at a walk are you,LM
1423,going to arras added the road mender yes if you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early he stopped his horse and asked the laborer how far is it from here to arras nearly seven good leagues how is that the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter ah returned the road mender so you don't know that the road is under repair you will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on there is no way to proceed further really you will take the road on the left leading to carency you will cross the river when you reach camblin you will turn to the right that is the road to mont saint eloy which leads to arras but it is night and i shall lose my way you do not belong in these parts no and besides it is all cross roads stop sir resumed the road mender shall i give you a piece of advice your horse is tired return to tinques there is a good inn there sleep there you can reach arras to morrow i must be there this evening that is different but go to the,LM
1424,inn all the same and get an extra horse the stable boy will guide you through the cross roads he followed the road mender's advice retraced his steps and half an hour later he passed the same spot again but this time at full speed with a good horse to aid a stable boy who called himself a postilion was seated on the shaft of the cariole still he felt that he had lost time night had fully come they turned into the cross road the way became frightfully bad the cart lurched from one rut to the other he said to the postilion keep at a trot and you shall have a double fee in one of the jolts the whiffle tree broke there's the whiffle tree broken sir said the postilion i don't know how to harness my horse now this road is very bad at night if you wish to return and sleep at tinques we could be in arras early to morrow morning he replied have you a bit of rope and a knife yes sir he cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle tree of it this caused another loss of twenty,LM
1425,minutes but they set out again at a gallop the plain was gloomy low hanging black crisp fogs crept over the hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke there were whitish gleams in the clouds a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a sound in all quarters of the horizon as of some one moving furniture everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror how many things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night he was stiff with cold he had eaten nothing since the night before he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in the neighborhood of d eight years previously and it seemed but yesterday the hour struck from a distant tower he asked the boy what time is it seven o'clock sir we shall reach arras at eight we have but three leagues still to go at that moment he for the first time indulged in this reflection thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner that all this trouble which he was taking was perhaps useless that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial that he should,LM
1426,at least have informed himself of that that he was foolish to go thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not then he sketched out some calculations in his mind that ordinarily the sittings of the court of assizes began at nine o'clock in the morning that it could not be a long affair that the theft of the apples would be very brief that there would then remain only a question of identity four or five depositions and very little for the lawyers to say that he should arrive after all was over the postilion whipped up the horses they had crossed the river and left mont saint eloy behind them the night grew more profound vi sister simplice put to the proof but at that moment fantine was joyous she had passed a very bad night her cough was frightful her fever had doubled in intensity she had had dreams in the morning when the doctor paid his visit she was delirious he assumed an alarmed look and ordered that he should be informed as soon as m madeleine arrived all the morning she was melancholy said but little and laid plaits,LM
1427,in her sheets murmuring the while in a low voice calculations which seemed to be calculations of distances her eyes were hollow and staring they seemed almost extinguished at intervals then lighted up again and shone like stars it seems as though at the approach of a certain dark hour the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the light of earth each time that sister simplice asked her how she felt she replied invariably well i should like to see m madeleine some months before this at the moment when fantine had just lost her last modesty her last shame and her last joy she was the shadow of herself now she was the spectre of herself physical suffering had completed the work of moral suffering this creature of five and twenty had a wrinkled brow flabby cheeks pinched nostrils teeth from which the gums had receded a leaden complexion a bony neck prominent shoulder blades frail limbs a clayey skin and her golden hair was growing out sprinkled with gray alas how illness improvises old age at mid day the physician returned gave some directions inquired whether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary and,LM
1428,shook his head m madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o'clock as exactness is kindness he was exact about half past two fantine began to be restless in the course of twenty minutes she asked the nun more than ten times what time is it sister three o'clock struck at the third stroke fantine sat up in bed she who could in general hardly turn over joined her yellow fleshless hands in a sort of convulsive clasp and the nun heard her utter one of those profound sighs which seem to throw off dejection then fantine turned and looked at the door no one entered the door did not open she remained thus for a quarter of an hour her eyes riveted on the door motionless and apparently holding her breath the sister dared not speak to her the clock struck a quarter past three fantine fell back on her pillow she said nothing but began to plait the sheets once more half an hour passed then an hour no one came every time the clock struck fantine started up and looked towards the door then fell back again her thought was clearly perceptible but she uttered,LM
1429,no name she made no complaint she blamed no one but she coughed in a melancholy way one would have said that something dark was descending upon her she was livid and her lips were blue she smiled now and then five o'clock struck then the sister heard her say very low and gently he is wrong not to come to day since i am going away to morrow sister simplice herself was surprised at m madeleine's delay in the meantime fantine was staring at the tester of her bed she seemed to be endeavoring to recall something all at once she began to sing in a voice as feeble as a breath the nun listened this is what fantine was singing lovely things we will buy as we stroll the faubourgs through roses are pink corn flowers are blue i love my love corn flowers are blue yestere'en the virgin mary came near my stove in a broidered mantle clad and said to me here hide neath my veil the child whom you one day begged from me haste to the city buy linen buy a needle buy thread lovely things we will buy as we stroll the faubourgs,LM
1430,through dear holy virgin beside my stove i have set a cradle with ribbons decked god may give me his loveliest star i prefer the child thou hast granted me madame what shall i do with this linen fine make of it clothes for thy new born babe roses are pink and corn flowers are blue i love my love and corn flowers are blue wash this linen where in the stream make of it soiling not spoiling not a petticoat fair with its bodice fine which i will embroider and fill with flowers madame the child is no longer here what is to be done then make of it a winding sheet in which to bury me lovely things we will buy as we stroll the faubourgs through roses are pink corn flowers are blue i love my love corn flowers are blue this song was an old cradle romance with which she had in former days lulled her little cosette to sleep and which had never recurred to her mind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her child she sang it in so sad a voice and to so sweet an air,LM
1431,that it was enough to make any one even a nun weep the sister accustomed as she was to austerities felt a tear spring to her eyes the clock struck six fantine did not seem to hear it she no longer seemed to pay attention to anything about her sister simplice sent a serving maid to inquire of the portress of the factory whether the mayor had returned and if he would not come to the infirmary soon the girl returned in a few minutes fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts the servant informed sister simplice in a very low tone that the mayor had set out that morning before six o'clock in a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse cold as the weather was that he had gone alone without even a driver that no one knew what road he had taken that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to arras that others asserted that they had met him on the road to paris that when he went away he had been very gentle as usual and that he had merely told the portress not to expect him,LM
1432,that night while the two women were whispering together with their backs turned to fantine's bed the sister interrogating the servant conjecturing fantine with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies which unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of death had raised herself to her knees in bed with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster and her head thrust through the opening of the curtains and was listening all at once she cried you are speaking of m madeleine why are you talking so low what is he doing why does he not come her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard the voice of a man they wheeled round in affright answer me cried fantine the servant stammered the portress told me that he could not come to day be calm my child said the sister lie down again fantine without changing her attitude continued in a loud voice and with an accent that was both imperious and heart rending he cannot come why not you know the reason you are whispering it to each other there i want to know it the servant maid hastened to say,LM
1433,in the nun's ear say that he is busy with the city council sister simplice blushed faintly for it was a lie that the maid had proposed to her on the other hand it seemed to her that the mere communication of the truth to the invalid would without doubt deal her a terrible blow and that this was a serious matter in fantine's present state her flush did not last long the sister raised her calm sad eyes to fantine and said monsieur le maire has gone away fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed her eyes sparkled indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face gone she cried he has gone to get cosette then she raised her arms to heaven and her white face became ineffable her lips moved she was praying in a low voice when her prayer was finished sister she said i am willing to lie down again i will do anything you wish i was naughty just now i beg your pardon for having spoken so loud it is very wrong to talk loudly i know that well my good sister but you see i am very happy the good,LM
1434,god is good m madeleine is good just think he has gone to montfermeil to get my little cosette she lay down again with the nun's assistance helped the nun to arrange her pillow and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck and which sister simplice had given her my child said the sister try to rest now and do not talk any more fantine took the sister's hand in her moist hands and the latter was pained to feel that perspiration he set out this morning for paris in fact he need not even go through paris montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence do you remember how he said to me yesterday when i spoke to him of cosette soon soon he wants to give me a surprise you know he made me sign a letter so that she could be taken from the thenardiers they cannot say anything can they they will give back cosette for they have been paid the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay do not make signs to me that i must not talk sister i,LM
1435,am extremely happy i am doing well i am not ill at all any more i am going to see cosette again i am even quite hungry it is nearly five years since i saw her last you cannot imagine how much attached one gets to children and then she will be so pretty you will see if you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had in the first place she will have very beautiful hands she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old like this she must be a big girl now she is seven years old she is quite a young lady i call her cosette but her name is really euphrasie stop this morning i was looking at the dust on the chimney piece and i had a sort of idea come across me like that that i should see cosette again soon mon dieu how wrong it is not to see one's children for years one ought to reflect that life is not eternal oh how good m le maire is to go it is very cold it is true he had on his cloak at least he will be here,LM
1436,to morrow will he not to morrow will be a festival day to morrow morning sister you must remind me to put on my little cap that has lace on it what a place that montfermeil is i took that journey on foot once it was very long for me but the diligences go very quickly he will be here to morrow with cosette how far is it from here to montfermeil the sister who had no idea of distances replied oh i think that he will be here to morrow to morrow to morrow said fantine i shall see cosette to morrow you see good sister of the good god that i am no longer ill i am mad i could dance if any one wished it a person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have understood the change she was all rosy now she spoke in a lively and natural voice her whole face was one smile now and then she talked she laughed softly the joy of a mother is almost infantile well resumed the nun now that you are happy mind me and do not talk any more fantine laid,LM
1437,her head on her pillow and said in a low voice yes lie down again be good for you are going to have your child sister simplice is right every one here is right and then without stirring without even moving her head she began to stare all about her with wide open eyes and a joyous air and she said nothing more the sister drew the curtains together again hoping that she would fall into a doze between seven and eight o'clock the doctor came not hearing any sound he thought fantine was asleep entered softly and approached the bed on tiptoe he opened the curtains a little and by the light of the taper he saw fantine's big eyes gazing at him she said to him she will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed will she not sir the doctor thought that she was delirious she added see there is just room the doctor took sister simplice aside and she explained matters to him that m madeleine was absent for a day or two and that in their doubt they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid who believed that the mayor,LM
1438,had gone to montfermeil that it was possible after all that her guess was correct the doctor approved he returned to fantine's bed and she went on you see when she wakes up in the morning i shall be able to say good morning to her poor kitten and when i cannot sleep at night i can hear her asleep her little gentle breathing will do me good give me your hand said the doctor she stretched out her arm and exclaimed with a laugh ah hold in truth you did not know it i am cured cosette will arrive to morrow the doctor was surprised she was better the pressure on her chest had decreased her pulse had regained its strength a sort of life had suddenly supervened and reanimated this poor worn out creature doctor she went on did the sister tell you that m le maire has gone to get that mite of a child the doctor recommended silence and that all painful emotions should be avoided he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona and in case the fever should increase again during the night a calming potion as he took his departure he said to the,LM
1439,sister she is doing better if good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive to morrow with the child who knows there are crises so astounding great joy has been known to arrest maladies i know well that this is an organic disease and in an advanced state but all those things are such mysteries we may be able to save her vii the traveller on his arrival takes precautions for departure it was nearly eight o'clock in the evening when the cart which we left on the road entered the porte cochere of the hotel de la poste in arras the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted from it responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the people of the inn sent back the extra horse and with his own hands led the little white horse to the stable then he opened the door of a billiard room which was situated on the ground floor sat down there and leaned his elbows on a table he had taken fourteen hours for the journey which he had counted on making in six he did himself the justice to acknowledge that it was,LM
1440,not his fault but at bottom he was not sorry the landlady of the hotel entered does monsieur wish a bed does monsieur require supper he made a sign of the head in the negative the stableman says that monsieur's horse is extremely fatigued here he broke his silence will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to morrow morning oh monsieur he must rest for two days at least he inquired is not the posting station located here yes sir the hostess conducted him to the office he showed his passport and inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to m sur m by the mail wagon the seat beside the post boy chanced to be vacant he engaged it and paid for it monsieur said the clerk do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o'clock in the morning this done he left the hotel and began to wander about the town he was not acquainted with arras the streets were dark and he walked on at random but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the passers by he crossed the little river,LM
1441,crinchon and found himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way a citizen was passing along with a lantern after some hesitation he decided to apply to this man not without having first glanced behind and in front of him as though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was about to put monsieur said he where is the court house if you please you do not belong in town sir replied the bourgeois who was an oldish man well follow me i happen to be going in the direction of the court house that is to say in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture for the court house is undergoing repairs just at this moment and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the prefecture is it there that the assizes are held he asked certainly sir you see the prefecture of to day was the bishop's palace before the revolution m de conzie who was bishop in built a grand hall there it is in this grand hall that the court is held on the way the bourgeois said to him if monsieur desires to witness a,LM
1442,case it is rather late the sittings generally close at six o'clock when they arrived on the grand square however the man pointed out to him four long windows all lighted up in the front of a vast and gloomy building upon my word sir you are in luck you have arrived in season do you see those four windows that is the court of assizes there is light there so they are not through the matter must have been greatly protracted and they are holding an evening session do you take an interest in this affair is it a criminal case are you a witness he replied i have not come on any business i only wish to speak to one of the lawyers that is different said the bourgeois stop sir here is the door where the sentry stands you have only to ascend the grand staircase he conformed to the bourgeois's directions and a few minutes later he was in a hall containing many people and where groups intermingled with lawyers in their gowns were whispering together here and there it is always a heart breaking thing to see these congregations of men robed in black murmuring,LM
1443,together in low voices on the threshold of the halls of justice it is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these words condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be the result all these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices this spacious hall illuminated by a single lamp was the old hall of the episcopal palace and served as the large hall of the palace of justice a double leaved door which was closed at that moment separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting the obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer whom he met what stage have they reached sir he asked it is finished said the lawyer finished this word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round excuse me sir perhaps you are a relative no i know no one here has judgment been pronounced of course nothing else was possible to penal servitude for life he continued in a voice so weak that it was barely audible then his identity was established what,LM
1444,identity replied the lawyer there was no identity to be established the matter was very simple the woman had murdered her child the infanticide was proved the jury threw out the question of premeditation and she was condemned for life so it was a woman said he why certainly the limosin woman of what are you speaking nothing but since it is all over how comes it that the hall is still lighted for another case which was begun about two hours ago what other case oh this one is a clear case also it is about a sort of blackguard a man arrested for a second offence a convict who has been guilty of theft i don't know his name exactly there's a bandit's phiz for you i'd send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone is there any way of getting into the court room sir said he i really think that there is not there is a great crowd however the hearing has been suspended some people have gone out and when the hearing is resumed you might make an effort where is the entrance through yonder large door the lawyer left him,LM
1445,in the course of a few moments he had experienced almost simultaneously almost intermingled with each other all possible emotions the words of this indifferent spectator had in turn pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire when he saw that nothing was settled he breathed freely once more but he could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure he drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying the docket of the session was very heavy the president had appointed for the same day two short and simple cases they had begun with the infanticide and now they had reached the convict the old offender the return horse this man had stolen apples but that did not appear to be entirely proved what had been proved was that he had already been in the galleys at toulon it was that which lent a bad aspect to his case however the man's examination and the depositions of the witnesses had been completed but the lawyer's plea and the speech of the public prosecutor were still to come it could not be finished before midnight the man would probably be,LM
1446,condemned the attorney general was very clever and never missed his culprits he was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses an usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the assizes he inquired of this usher will the door be opened soon sir it will not be opened at all replied the usher what it will not be opened when the hearing is resumed is not the hearing suspended the hearing has just been begun again replied the usher but the door will not be opened again why because the hall is full what there is not room for one more not another one the door is closed no one can enter now the usher added after a pause there are to tell the truth two or three extra places behind monsieur le president but monsieur le president only admits public functionaries to them so saying the usher turned his back he retired with bowed head traversed the antechamber and slowly descended the stairs as though hesitating at every step it is probable that he was holding counsel with himself the violent conflict which had been going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended,LM
1447,and every moment he encountered some new phase of it on reaching the landing place he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his arms all at once he opened his coat drew out his pocket book took from it a pencil tore out a leaf and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly by the light of the street lantern this line m madeleine mayor of m sur m then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides made his way through the crowd walked straight up to the usher handed him the paper and said in an authoritative manner take this to monsieur le president the usher took the paper cast a glance upon it and obeyed viii an entrance by favor although he did not suspect the fact the mayor of m sur m enjoyed a sort of celebrity for the space of seven years his reputation for virtue had filled the whole of bas boulonnais it had eventually passed the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two or three neighboring departments besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry there was,LM
1448,not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of m sur m which was not indebted to him for some benefit he had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries of other arrondissements it was thus that he had when occasion offered supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at boulogne the flax spinning industry at frevent and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at boubers sur canche everywhere the name of m madeleine was pronounced with veneration arras and douai envied the happy little town of m sur m its mayor the councillor of the royal court of douai who was presiding over this session of the assizes at arras was acquainted in common with the rest of the world with this name which was so profoundly and universally honored when the usher discreetly opening the door which connected the council chamber with the court room bent over the back of the president's arm chair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed the line which we have just perused adding the gentleman desires to be present at the trial the president with a quick and deferential movement seized,LM
1449,a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper and returned it to the usher saying admit him the unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door of the hall in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him in the midst of his revery he heard some one saying to him will monsieur do me the honor to follow me it was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously and who was now bowing to the earth before him at the same time the usher handed him the paper he unfolded it and as he chanced to be near the light he could read it the president of the court of assizes presents his respects to m madeleine he crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him a strange and bitter aftertaste he followed the usher a few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted cabinet of severe aspect lighted by two wax candles placed upon a table with a green cloth the last words of the usher who,LM
1450,had just quitted him still rang in his ears monsieur you are now in the council chamber you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door and you will find yourself in the court room behind the president's chair these words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed the usher had left him alone the supreme moment had arrived he sought to collect his faculties but could not it is chiefly at the moment when there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful realities of life that the threads of thought snap within the brain he was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned with stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment where so many lives had been broken which was soon to ring with his name and which his fate was at that moment traversing he stared at the wall then he looked at himself wondering that it should be that chamber and that it should be he he had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours he was worn out by the jolts of the,LM
1451,cart but he was not conscious of it it seemed to him that he felt nothing he approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall and which contained under glass an ancient autograph letter of jean nicolas pache mayor of paris and minister and dated through an error no doubt the th of june of the year ii and in which pache forwarded to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment and who had watched him would have imagined doubtless that this letter struck him as very curious for he did not take his eyes from it and he read it two or three times he read it without paying any attention to it and unconsciously he was thinking of fantine and cosette as he dreamed he turned round and his eyes fell upon the brass knob of the door which separated him from the court of assizes he had almost forgotten that door his glance calm at first paused there remained fixed on that brass handle then grew terrified and little by little became impregnated with fear beads of perspiration,LM
1452,burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples at a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of authority mingled with rebellion which is intended to convey and which does so well convey pardieu who compels me to this then he wheeled briskly round caught sight of the door through which he had entered in front of him went to it opened it and passed out he was no longer in that chamber he was outside in a corridor a long narrow corridor broken by steps and gratings making all sorts of angles lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids the corridor through which he had approached he breathed he listened not a sound in front not a sound behind him and he fled as though pursued when he had turned many angles in this corridor he still listened the same silence reigned and there was the same darkness around him he was out of breath he staggered he leaned against the wall the stone was cold the perspiration lay ice cold on his brow he straightened himself up with a shiver then there alone in the darkness,LM
1453,trembling with cold and with something else too perchance he meditated he had meditated all night long he had meditated all the day he heard within him but one voice which said alas a quarter of an hour passed thus at length he bowed his head sighed with agony dropped his arms and retraced his steps he walked slowly and as though crushed it seemed as though some one had overtaken him in his flight and was leading him back he re entered the council chamber the first thing he caught sight of was the knob of the door this knob which was round and of polished brass shone like a terrible star for him he gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger he could not take his eyes from it from time to time he advanced a step and approached the door had he listened he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall like a sort of confused murmur but he did not listen and he did not hear suddenly without himself knowing how it happened he found himself near the door he grasped the knob convulsively the door opened,LM
1454,he was in the court room ix a place where convictions are in process of formation he advanced a pace closed the door mechanically behind him and remained standing contemplating what he saw it was a vast and badly lighted apartment now full of uproar now full of silence where all the apparatus of a criminal case with its petty and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng was in process of development at the one end of the hall the one where he was were judges with abstracted air in threadbare robes who were gnawing their nails or closing their eyelids at the other end a ragged crowd lawyers in all sorts of attitudes soldiers with hard but honest faces ancient spotted woodwork a dirty ceiling tables covered with serge that was yellow rather than green doors blackened by handmarks tap room lamps which emitted more smoke than light suspended from nails in the wainscot on the tables candles in brass candlesticks darkness ugliness sadness and from all this there was disengaged an austere and august impression for one there felt that grand human thing which is called the law and that grand divine thing which is called,LM
1455,justice no one in all that throng paid any attention to him all glances were directed towards a single point a wooden bench placed against a small door in the stretch of wall on the president's left on this bench illuminated by several candles sat a man between two gendarmes this man was the man he did not seek him he saw him his eyes went thither naturally as though they had known beforehand where that figure was he thought he was looking at himself grown old not absolutely the same in face of course but exactly similar in attitude and aspect with his bristling hair with that wild and uneasy eye with that blouse just as it was on the day when he entered d full of hatred concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison he said to himself with a shudder good god shall i become like that again this creature seemed to be at least sixty there was something indescribably coarse stupid and frightened about him at the sound made by the opening door people had drawn aside to make,LM
1456,way for him the president had turned his head and understanding that the personage who had just entered was the mayor of m sur m he had bowed to him the attorney general who had seen m madeleine at m sur m whither the duties of his office had called him more than once recognized him and saluted him also he had hardly perceived it he was the victim of a sort of hallucination he was watching judges clerks gendarmes a throng of cruelly curious heads all these he had already beheld once in days gone by twenty seven years before he had encountered those fatal things once more there they were they moved they existed it was no longer an effort of his memory a mirage of his thought they were real gendarmes and real judges a real crowd and real men of flesh and blood it was all over he beheld the monstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him with all that there is formidable in reality all this was yawning before him he was horrified by it he shut his eyes and exclaimed in the deepest recesses of his soul never and,LM
1457,by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble and rendered him nearly mad it was another self of his that was there all called that man who was being tried jean valjean under his very eyes unheard of vision he had a sort of representation of the most horrible moment of his life enacted by his spectre everything was there the apparatus was the same the hour of the night the faces of the judges of soldiers and of spectators all were the same only above the president's head there hung a crucifix something which the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation god had been absent when he had been judged there was a chair behind him he dropped into it terrified at the thought that he might be seen when he was seated he took advantage of a pile of cardboard boxes which stood on the judge's desk to conceal his face from the whole room he could now see without being seen he had fully regained consciousness of the reality of things gradually he recovered he attained that phase of composure where it is possible to listen m bamatabois was one,LM
1458,of the jurors he looked for javert but did not see him the seat of the witnesses was hidden from him by the clerk's table and then as we have just said the hall was sparely lighted at the moment of this entrance the defendant's lawyer had just finished his plea the attention of all was excited to the highest pitch the affair had lasted for three hours for three hours that crowd had been watching a strange man a miserable specimen of humanity either profoundly stupid or profoundly subtle gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible likeness this man as the reader already knows was a vagabond who had been found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples broken in the orchard of a neighbor called the pierron orchard who was this man an examination had been made witnesses had been heard and they were unanimous light had abounded throughout the entire debate the accusation said we have in our grasp not only a marauder a stealer of fruit we have here in our hands a bandit an old offender who has broken his ban an ex convict a miscreant of the most dangerous description,LM

1460,a question of the most menacing future for him the likeness increased every moment and the entire crowd surveyed with more anxiety than he did himself that sentence freighted with calamity which descended ever closer over his head there was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded besides the galleys a possible death penalty in case his identity were established and the affair of little gervais were to end thereafter in condemnation who was this man what was the nature of his apathy was it imbecility or craft did he understand too well or did he not understand at all these were questions which divided the crowd and seemed to divide the jury there was something both terrible and puzzling in this case the drama was not only melancholy it was also obscure the counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well in that provincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar and which was formerly employed by all advocates at paris as well as at romorantin or at montbrison and which to day having become classic is no longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy to whom it is suited on account of its,LM
1461,grave sonorousness and its majestic stride a tongue in which a husband is called a consort and a woman a spouse paris the centre of art and civilization the king the monarch monseigneur the bishop a sainted pontiff the district attorney the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution the arguments the accents which we have just listened to the age of louis xiv the grand age a theatre the temple of melpomene the reigning family the august blood of our kings a concert a musical solemnity the general commandant of the province the illustrious warrior who etc the pupils in the seminary these tender levities errors imputed to newspapers the imposture which distills its venom through the columns of those organs etc the lawyer had accordingly begun with an explanation as to the theft of the apples an awkward matter couched in fine style but benigne bossuet himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the midst of a funeral oration and he extricated himself from the situation in stately fashion the lawyer established the fact that the theft of the apples had not been circumstantially proved his client whom he in his character of counsel persisted in calling champmathieu,LM
1462,had not been seen scaling that wall nor breaking that branch by any one he had been taken with that branch which the lawyer preferred to call a bough in his possession but he said that he had found it broken off and lying on the ground and had picked it up where was there any proof to the contrary no doubt that branch had been broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall then thrown away by the alarmed marauder there was no doubt that there had been a thief in the case but what proof was there that that thief had been champmathieu one thing only his character as an ex convict the lawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be unhappily well attested the accused had resided at faverolles the accused had exercised the calling of a tree pruner there the name of champmathieu might well have had its origin in jean mathieu all that was true in short four witnesses recognize champmathieu positively and without hesitation as that convict jean valjean to these signs to this testimony the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his client the denial of an,LM
1463,interested party but supposing that he was the convict jean valjean did that prove that he was the thief of the apples that was a presumption at the most not a proof the prisoner it was true and his counsel in good faith was obliged to admit it had adopted a bad system of defence he obstinately denied everything the theft and his character of convict an admission upon this last point would certainly have been better and would have won for him the indulgence of his judges the counsel had advised him to do this but the accused had obstinately refused thinking no doubt that he would save everything by admitting nothing it was an error but ought not the paucity of this intelligence to be taken into consideration this man was visibly stupid long continued wretchedness in the galleys long misery outside the galleys had brutalized him etc he defended himself badly was that a reason for condemning him as for the affair with little gervais the counsel need not discuss it it did not enter into the case the lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the court if the identity of jean valjean appeared to,LM
1464,them to be evident to apply to him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his ban and not the frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a second offence the district attorney answered the counsel for the defence he was violent and florid as district attorneys usually are he congratulated the counsel for the defence on his loyalty and skilfully took advantage of this loyalty he reached the accused through all the concessions made by his lawyer the advocate had seemed to admit that the prisoner was jean valjean he took note of this so this man was jean valjean this point had been conceded to the accusation and could no longer be disputed here by means of a clever autonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime the district attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic school then dawning under the name of the satanic school which had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the quotidienne and the oriflamme he attributed not without some probability to the influence of this perverse literature the crime of champmathieu or rather to speak more correctly of jean valjean,LM
1465,having exhausted these considerations he passed on to jean valjean himself who was this jean valjean description of jean valjean a monster spewed forth etc the model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of theramene which is not useful to tragedy but which every day renders great services to judicial eloquence the audience and the jury shuddered the description finished the district attorney resumed with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the journal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day and it is such a man etc etc etc vagabond beggar without means of existence etc etc inured by his past life to culpable deeds and but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys as was proved by the crime committed against little gervais etc etc it is such a man caught upon the highway in the very act of theft a few paces from a wall that had been scaled still holding in his hand the object stolen who denies the crime the theft the climbing the wall denies everything denies even his own identity in addition to a hundred other proofs to which we will not,LM
1466,recur four witnesses recognize him javert the upright inspector of police javert and three of his former companions in infamy the convicts brevet chenildieu and cochepaille what does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming unanimity his denial what obduracy you will do justice gentlemen of the jury etc etc while the district attorney was speaking the accused listened to him open mouthed with a sort of amazement in which some admiration was assuredly blended he was evidently surprised that a man could talk like that from time to time at those energetic moments of the prosecutor's speech when eloquence which cannot contain itself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops the accused like a storm he moved his head slowly from right to left and from left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with which he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument two or three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in a low voice that is what comes of not having asked m baloup the district attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid attitude evidently deliberate which denoted not imbecility but,LM
1467,craft skill a habit of deceiving justice and which set forth in all its nakedness the profound perversity of this man he ended by making his reserves on the affair of little gervais and demanding a severe sentence at that time as the reader will remember it was penal servitude for life the counsel for the defence rose began by complimenting monsieur l'avocat general on his admirable speech then replied as best he could but he weakened the ground was evidently slipping away from under his feet x the system of denials the moment for closing the debate had arrived the president had the accused stand up and addressed to him the customary question have you anything to add to your defence the man did not appear to understand as he stood there twisting in his hands a terrible cap which he had the president repeated the question this time the man heard it he seemed to understand he made a motion like a man who is just waking up cast his eyes about him stared at the audience the gendarmes his counsel the jury the court laid his monstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his,LM
1468,bench took another look and all at once fixing his glance upon the district attorney he began to speak it was like an eruption it seemed from the manner in which the words escaped from his mouth incoherent impetuous pell mell tumbling over each other as though they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once he said this is what i have to say that i have been a wheelwright in paris and that it was with monsieur baloup it is a hard trade in the wheelwright's trade one works always in the open air in courtyards under sheds when the masters are good never in closed workshops because space is required you see in winter one gets so cold that one beats one's arms together to warm one's self but the masters don't like it they say it wastes time handling iron when there is ice between the paving stones is hard work that wears a man out quickly one is old while he is still quite young in that trade at forty a man is done for i was fifty three i was in a bad state and then workmen are so mean when a man,LM
1469,is no longer young they call him nothing but an old bird old beast i was not earning more than thirty sous a day they paid me as little as possible the masters took advantage of my age and then i had my daughter who was a laundress at the river she earned a little also it sufficed for us two she had trouble also all day long up to her waist in a tub in rain in snow when the wind cuts your face when it freezes it is all the same you must still wash there are people who have not much linen and wait until late if you do not wash you lose your custom the planks are badly joined and water drops on you from everywhere you have your petticoats all damp above and below that penetrates she has also worked at the laundry of the enfants rouges where the water comes through faucets you are not in the tub there you wash at the faucet in front of you and rinse in a basin behind you as it is enclosed you are not so cold but there is that hot steam which is terrible and,LM
1470,which ruins your eyes she came home at seven o'clock in the evening and went to bed at once she was so tired her husband beat her she is dead we have not been very happy she was a good girl who did not go to the ball and who was very peaceable i remember one shrove tuesday when she went to bed at eight o'clock there i am telling the truth you have only to ask ah yes how stupid i am paris is a gulf who knows father champmathieu there but m baloup does i tell you go see at m baloup's and after all i don't know what is wanted of me the man ceased speaking and remained standing he had said these things in a loud rapid hoarse voice with a sort of irritated and savage ingenuousness once he paused to salute some one in the crowd the sort of affirmations which he seemed to fling out before him at random came like hiccoughs and to each he added the gesture of a wood cutter who is splitting wood when he had finished the audience burst into a laugh he stared at the public and perceiving,LM
1471,that they were laughing and not understanding why he began to laugh himself it was inauspicious the president an attentive and benevolent man raised his voice he reminded the gentlemen of the jury that the sieur baloup formerly a master wheelwright with whom the accused stated that he had served had been summoned in vain he had become bankrupt and was not to be found then turning to the accused he enjoined him to listen to what he was about to say and added you are in a position where reflection is necessary the gravest presumptions rest upon you and may induce vital results prisoner in your own interests i summon you for the last time to explain yourself clearly on two points in the first place did you or did you not climb the wall of the pierron orchard break the branch and steal the apples that is to say commit the crime of breaking in and theft in the second place are you the discharged convict jean valjean yes or no the prisoner shook his head with a capable air like a man who has thoroughly understood and who knows what answer he is going to make he,LM
1472,opened his mouth turned towards the president and said in the first place then he stared at his cap stared at the ceiling and held his peace prisoner said the district attorney in a severe voice pay attention you are not answering anything that has been asked of you your embarrassment condemns you it is evident that your name is not champmathieu that you are the convict jean valjean concealed first under the name of jean mathieu which was the name of his mother that you went to auvergne that you were born at faverolles where you were a pruner of trees it is evident that you have been guilty of entering and of the theft of ripe apples from the pierron orchard the gentlemen of the jury will form their own opinion the prisoner had finally resumed his seat he arose abruptly when the district attorney had finished and exclaimed you are very wicked that you are this what i wanted to say i could not find words for it at first i have stolen nothing i am a man who does not have something to eat every day i was coming from ailly i was walking through the,LM
1473,country after a shower which had made the whole country yellow even the ponds were overflowed and nothing sprang from the sand any more but the little blades of grass at the wayside i found a broken branch with apples on the ground i picked up the branch without knowing that it would get me into trouble i have been in prison and they have been dragging me about for the last three months more than that i cannot say people talk against me they tell me answer the gendarme who is a good fellow nudges my elbow and says to me in a low voice come answer i don't know how to explain i have no education i am a poor man that is where they wrong me because they do not see this i have not stolen i picked up from the ground things that were lying there you say jean valjean jean mathieu i don't know those persons they are villagers i worked for m baloup boulevard de l'hopital my name is champmathieu you are very clever to tell me where i was born i don't know myself it's not everybody who has a house in which,LM
1474,to come into the world that would be too convenient i think that my father and mother were people who strolled along the highways i know nothing different when i was a child they called me young fellow now they call me old fellow those are my baptismal names take that as you like i have been in auvergne i have been at faverolles pardi well can't a man have been in auvergne or at faverolles without having been in the galleys i tell you that i have not stolen and that i am father champmathieu i have been with m baloup i have had a settled residence you worry me with your nonsense there why is everybody pursuing me so furiously the district attorney had remained standing he addressed the president monsieur le president in view of the confused but exceedingly clever denials of the prisoner who would like to pass himself off as an idiot but who will not succeed in so doing we shall attend to that we demand that it shall please you and that it shall please the court to summon once more into this place the convicts brevet cochepaille and chenildieu and police inspector,LM
1475,javert and question them for the last time as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict jean valjean i would remind the district attorney said the president that police inspector javert recalled by his duties to the capital of a neighboring arrondissement left the court room and the town as soon as he had made his deposition we have accorded him permission with the consent of the district attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner that is true mr president responded the district attorney in the absence of sieur javert i think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of the jury of what he said here a few hours ago javert is an estimable man who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but important functions these are the terms of his deposition i do not even stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to give the lie to the prisoner's denial i recognize him perfectly the name of this man is not champmathieu he is an ex convict named jean valjean and is very vicious and much to be feared it is only with extreme regret that he was released,LM
1476,at the expiration of his term he underwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft he made five or six attempts to escape besides the theft from little gervais and from the pierron orchard i suspect him of a theft committed in the house of his grace the late bishop of d i often saw him at the time when i was adjutant of the galley guard at the prison in toulon i repeat that i recognize him perfectly this extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impression on the public and on the jury the district attorney concluded by insisting that in default of javert the three witnesses brevet chenildieu and cochepaille should be heard once more and solemnly interrogated the president transmitted the order to an usher and a moment later the door of the witnesses room opened the usher accompanied by a gendarme ready to lend him armed assistance introduced the convict brevet the audience was in suspense and all breasts heaved as though they had contained but one soul the ex convict brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central prisons brevet was a person sixty years of age who had a sort,LM
1477,of business man's face and the air of a rascal the two sometimes go together in prison whither fresh misdeeds had led him he had become something in the nature of a turnkey he was a man of whom his superiors said he tries to make himself of use the chaplains bore good testimony as to his religious habits it must not be forgotten that this passed under the restoration brevet said the president you have undergone an ignominious sentence and you cannot take an oath brevet dropped his eyes nevertheless continued the president even in the man whom the law has degraded there may remain when the divine mercy permits it a sentiment of honor and of equity it is to this sentiment that i appeal at this decisive hour if it still exists in you and i hope it does reflect before replying to me consider on the one hand this man whom a word from you may ruin on the other hand justice which a word from you may enlighten the instant is solemn there is still time to retract if you think you have been mistaken rise prisoner brevet take a good look at the accused,LM
1478,recall your souvenirs and tell us on your soul and conscience if you persist in recognizing this man as your former companion in the galleys jean valjean brevet looked at the prisoner then turned towards the court yes mr president i was the first to recognize him and i stick to it that man is jean valjean who entered at toulon in and left in i left a year later he has the air of a brute now but it must be because age has brutalized him he was sly at the galleys i recognize him positively take your seat said the president prisoner remain standing chenildieu was brought in a prisoner for life as was indicated by his red cassock and his green cap he was serving out his sentence at the galleys of toulon whence he had been brought for this case he was a small man of about fifty brisk wrinkled frail yellow brazen faced feverish who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs and his whole person and an immense force in his glance his companions in the galleys had nicknamed him i deny god je nie dieu chenildieu the president addressed him,LM
1479,in nearly the same words which he had used to brevet at the moment when he reminded him of his infamy which deprived him of the right to take an oath chenildieu raised his head and looked the crowd in the face the president invited him to reflection and asked him as he had asked brevet if he persisted in recognition of the prisoner chenildieu burst out laughing pardieu as if i didn't recognize him we were attached to the same chain for five years so you are sulking old fellow go take your seat said the president the usher brought in cochepaille he was another convict for life who had come from the galleys and was dressed in red like chenildieu was a peasant from lourdes and a half bear of the pyrenees he had guarded the flocks among the mountains and from a shepherd he had slipped into a brigand cochepaille was no less savage and seemed even more stupid than the prisoner he was one of those wretched men whom nature has sketched out for wild beasts and on whom society puts the finishing touches as convicts in the galleys the president tried to touch him with,LM
1480,some grave and pathetic words and asked him as he had asked the other two if he persisted without hesitation or trouble in recognizing the man who was standing before him he is jean valjean said cochepaille he was even called jean the screw because he was so strong each of these affirmations from these three men evidently sincere and in good faith had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for the prisoner a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that a fresh declaration was added to the proceeding the prisoner had listened to them with that astounded face which was according to the accusation his principal means of defence at the first the gendarmes his neighbors had heard him mutter between his teeth ah well he's a nice one after the second he said a little louder with an air that was almost that of satisfaction good at the third he cried famous the president addressed him have you heard prisoner what have you to say he replied i say famous an uproar broke out among the audience and was communicated to the jury it was evident that the man was lost ushers said,LM
1481,the president enforce silence i am going to sum up the arguments at that moment there was a movement just beside the president a voice was heard crying brevet chenildieu cochepaille look here all who heard that voice were chilled so lamentable and terrible was it all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded a man placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind the court had just risen had pushed open the half door which separated the tribunal from the audience and was standing in the middle of the hall the president the district attorney m bamatabois twenty persons recognized him and exclaimed in concert m madeleine xi champmathieu more and more astonished it was he in fact the clerk's lamp illumined his countenance he held his hat in his hand there was no disorder in his clothing his coat was carefully buttoned he was very pale and he trembled slightly his hair which had still been gray on his arrival in arras was now entirely white it had turned white during the hour he had sat there all heads were raised the sensation was indescribable there was a momentary hesitation in the audience the,LM
1482,voice had been so heart rending the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand at first they asked themselves whether he had indeed uttered that cry they could not believe that that tranquil man had been the one to give that terrible outcry this indecision only lasted a few seconds even before the president and the district attorney could utter a word before the ushers and the gendarmes could make a gesture the man whom all still called at that moment m madeleine had advanced towards the witnesses cochepaille brevet and chenildieu do you not recognize me said he all three remained speechless and indicated by a sign of the head that they did not know him cochepaille who was intimidated made a military salute m madeleine turned towards the jury and the court and said in a gentle voice gentlemen of the jury order the prisoner to be released mr president have me arrested he is not the man whom you are in search of it is i i am jean valjean not a mouth breathed the first commotion of astonishment had been followed by a silence like that of the grave those within,LM
1483,the hall experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when something grand has been done in the meantime the face of the president was stamped with sympathy and sadness he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district attorney and a few low toned words with the assistant judges he addressed the public and asked in accents which all understood is there a physician present the district attorney took the word gentlemen of the jury the very strange and unexpected incident which disturbs the audience inspires us like yourselves only with a sentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express you all know by reputation at least the honorable m madeleine mayor of m sur m if there is a physician in the audience we join the president in requesting him to attend to m madeleine and to conduct him to his home m madeleine did not allow the district attorney to finish he interrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority these are the words which he uttered here they are literally as they were written down immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene and as they now ring,LM
1484,in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty years ago i thank you mr district attorney but i am not mad you shall see you were on the point of committing a great error release this man i am fulfilling a duty i am that miserable criminal i am the only one here who sees the matter clearly and i am telling you the truth god who is on high looks down on what i am doing at this moment and that suffices you can take me for here i am but i have done my best i concealed myself under another name i have become rich i have become a mayor i have tried to re enter the ranks of the honest it seems that that is not to be done in short there are many things which i cannot tell i will not narrate the story of my life to you you will hear it one of these days i robbed monseigneur the bishop it is true it is true that i robbed little gervais they were right in telling you that jean valjean was a very vicious wretch perhaps it was not altogether his fault,LM
1485,listen honorable judges a man who has been so greatly humbled as i have has neither any remonstrances to make to providence nor any advice to give to society but you see the infamy from which i have tried to escape is an injurious thing the galleys make the convict what he is reflect upon that if you please before going to the galleys i was a poor peasant with very little intelligence a sort of idiot the galleys wrought a change in me i was stupid i became vicious i was a block of wood i became a firebrand later on indulgence and kindness saved me as severity had ruined me but pardon me you cannot understand what i am saying you will find at my house among the ashes in the fireplace the forty sou piece which i stole seven years ago from little gervais i have nothing farther to add take me good god the district attorney shakes his head you say m madeleine has gone mad you do not believe me that is distressing do not at least condemn this man what these men do not recognize me i wish javert were here he would recognize,LM
1486,me nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which accompanied these words he turned to the three convicts and said well i recognize you do you remember brevet he paused hesitated for an instant and said do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which you wore in the galleys brevet gave a start of surprise and surveyed him from head to foot with a frightened air he continued chenildieu you who conferred on yourself the name of jenie dieu your whole right shoulder bears a deep burn because you one day laid your shoulder against the chafing dish full of coals in order to efface the three letters t f p which are still visible nevertheless answer is this true it is true said chenildieu he addressed himself to cochepaille cochepaille you have near the bend in your left arm a date stamped in blue letters with burnt powder the date is that of the landing of the emperor at cannes march pull up your sleeve cochepaille pushed up his sleeve all eyes were focused on him and on his bare arm a gendarme held a light close to it there was the date,LM
1487,the unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile which still rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of it it was a smile of triumph it was also a smile of despair you see plainly he said that i am jean valjean in that chamber there were no longer either judges accusers nor gendarmes there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts no one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play the district attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting the president that he was there to preside the counsel for the defence that he was there to defend it was a striking circumstance that no question was put that no authority intervened the peculiarity of sublime spectacles is that they capture all souls and turn witnesses into spectators no one probably could have explained what he felt no one probably said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid outburst of a grand light all felt themselves inwardly dazzled it was evident that they had jean valjean before their eyes that was clear the appearance of this man had sufficed,LM
1488,to suffuse with light that matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously without any further explanation the whole crowd as by a sort of electric revelation understood instantly and at a single glance the simple and magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that another man might not be condemned in his stead the details the hesitations little possible oppositions were swallowed up in that vast and luminous fact it was an impression which vanished speedily but which was irresistible at the moment i do not wish to disturb the court further resumed jean valjean i shall withdraw since you do not arrest me i have many things to do the district attorney knows who i am he knows whither i am going he can have me arrested when he likes he directed his steps towards the door not a voice was raised not an arm extended to hinder him all stood aside at that moment there was about him that divine something which causes multitudes to stand aside and make way for a man he traversed the crowd slowly it was never known who opened the door but it is certain that,LM
1489,he found the door open when he reached it on arriving there he turned round and said i am at your command mr district attorney then he addressed the audience all of you all who are present consider me worthy of pity do you not good god when i think of what i was on the point of doing i consider that i am to be envied nevertheless i should have preferred not to have had this occur he withdrew and the door closed behind him as it had opened for those who do certain sovereign things are always sure of being served by some one in the crowd less than an hour after this the verdict of the jury freed the said champmathieu from all accusations and champmathieu being at once released went off in a state of stupefaction thinking that all men were fools and comprehending nothing of this vision eighth a counter blow i in what mirror m madeleine contemplates his hair the day had begun to dawn fantine had passed a sleepless and feverish night filled with happy visions at daybreak she fell asleep sister simplice who had been watching with her availed herself of this,LM
1490,slumber to go and prepare a new potion of chinchona the worthy sister had been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments bending over her drugs and phials and scrutinizing things very closely on account of the dimness which the half light of dawn spreads over all objects suddenly she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek m madeleine stood before her he had just entered silently is it you mr mayor she exclaimed he replied in a low voice how is that poor woman not so bad just now but we have been very uneasy she explained to him what had passed that fantine had been very ill the day before and that she was better now because she thought that the mayor had gone to montfermeil to get her child the sister dared not question the mayor but she perceived plainly from his air that he had not come from there all that is good said he you were right not to undeceive her yes responded the sister but now mr mayor she will see you and will not see her child what shall we say to her he reflected for a moment god,LM
1491,will inspire us said he but we cannot tell a lie murmured the sister half aloud it was broad daylight in the room the light fell full on m madeleine's face the sister chanced to raise her eyes to it good god sir she exclaimed what has happened to you your hair is perfectly white white said he sister simplice had no mirror she rummaged in a drawer and pulled out the little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether a patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed m madeleine took the mirror looked at his hair and said well he uttered the word indifferently and as though his mind were on something else the sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a glimpse in all this he inquired can i see her is not monsieur le maire going to have her child brought back to her said the sister hardly venturing to put the question of course but it will take two or three days at least if she were not to see monsieur le maire until that time went on the sister timidly she would not know that monsieur,LM
1492,le maire had returned and it would be easy to inspire her with patience and when the child arrived she would naturally think monsieur le maire had just come with the child we should not have to enact a lie m madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments then he said with his calm gravity no sister i must see her i may perhaps be in haste the nun did not appear to notice this word perhaps which communicated an obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor's speech she replied lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully in that case she is asleep but monsieur le maire may enter he made some remarks about a door which shut badly and the noise of which might awaken the sick woman then he entered fantine's chamber approached the bed and drew aside the curtains she was asleep her breath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar to those maladies and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are watching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned to death but this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of ineffable serenity which,LM
1493,overspread her countenance and which transfigured her in her sleep her pallor had become whiteness her cheeks were crimson her long golden lashes the only beauty of her youth and her virginity which remained to her palpitated though they remained closed and drooping her whole person was trembling with an indescribable unfolding of wings all ready to open wide and bear her away which could be felt as they rustled though they could not be seen to see her thus one would never have dreamed that she was an invalid whose life was almost despaired of she resembled rather something on the point of soaring away than something on the point of dying the branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower and seems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time the human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in which the mysterious fingers of death are about to pluck the soul m madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed gazing in turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix as he had done two months before on the day when he had come for,LM
1494,the first time to see her in that asylum they were both still there in the same attitude she sleeping he praying only now after the lapse of two months her hair was gray and his was white the sister had not entered with him he stood beside the bed with his finger on his lips as though there were some one in the chamber whom he must enjoin to silence she opened her eyes saw him and said quietly with a smile and cosette ii fantine happy she made no movement of either surprise or of joy she was joy itself that simple question and cosette was put with so profound a faith with so much certainty with such a complete absence of disquiet and of doubt that he found not a word of reply she continued i knew that you were there i was asleep but i saw you i have seen you for a long long time i have been following you with my eyes all night long you were in a glory and you had around you all sorts of celestial forms he raised his glance to the crucifix but she resumed tell me where cosette,LM
1495,is why did not you place her on my bed against the moment of my waking he made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to recall fortunately the doctor had been warned and he now made his appearance he came to the aid of m madeleine calm yourself my child said the doctor your child is here fantine's eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light she clasped her hands with an expression which contained all that is possible to prayer in the way of violence and tenderness oh she exclaimed bring her to me touching illusion of a mother cosette was for her still the little child who is carried not yet said the doctor not just now you still have some fever the sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm you must be cured first she interrupted him impetuously but i am cured oh i tell you that i am cured what an ass that doctor is the idea i want to see my child you see said the doctor how excited you become so long as you are in this state i shall oppose your having your child it,LM
1496,is not enough to see her it is necessary that you should live for her when you are reasonable i will bring her to you myself the poor mother bowed her head i beg your pardon doctor i really beg your pardon formerly i should never have spoken as i have just done so many misfortunes have happened to me that i sometimes do not know what i am saying i understand you you fear the emotion i will wait as long as you like but i swear to you that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter i have been seeing her i have not taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening do you know if she were brought to me now i should talk to her very gently that is all is it not quite natural that i should desire to see my daughter who has been brought to me expressly from montfermeil i am not angry i know well that i am about to be happy all night long i have seen white things and persons who smiled at me when monsieur le docteur pleases he shall bring me cosette i have no,LM
1497,longer any fever i am well i am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matter with me any more but i am going to behave as though i were ill and not stir to please these ladies here when it is seen that i am very calm they will say she must have her child m madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed she turned towards him she was making a visible effort to be calm and very good as she expressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy in order that seeing her so peaceable they might make no difficulty about bringing cosette to her but while she controlled herself she could not refrain from questioning m madeleine did you have a pleasant trip monsieur le maire oh how good you were to go and get her for me only tell me how she is did she stand the journey well alas she will not recognize me she must have forgotten me by this time poor darling children have no memories they are like birds a child sees one thing to day and another thing to morrow and thinks of nothing any longer and,LM
1498,did she have white linen did those thenardiers keep her clean how have they fed her oh if you only knew how i have suffered putting such questions as that to myself during all the time of my wretchedness now it is all past i am happy oh how i should like to see her do you think her pretty monsieur le maire is not my daughter beautiful you must have been very cold in that diligence could she not be brought for just one little instant she might be taken away directly afterwards tell me you are the master it could be so if you chose he took her hand cosette is beautiful he said cosette is well you shall see her soon but calm yourself you are talking with too much vivacity and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes and that makes you cough in fact fits of coughing interrupted fantine at nearly every word fantine did not murmur she feared that she had injured by her too passionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of inspiring and she began to talk of indifferent things montfermeil is quite pretty is it not people,LM
1499,go there on pleasure parties in summer are the thenardiers prosperous there are not many travellers in their parts that inn of theirs is a sort of a cook shop m madeleine was still holding her hand and gazing at her with anxiety it was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mind now hesitated the doctor having finished his visit retired sister simplice remained alone with them but in the midst of this pause fantine exclaimed i hear her mon dieu i hear her she stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her held her breath and began to listen with rapture there was a child playing in the yard the child of the portress or of some work woman it was one of those accidents which are always occurring and which seem to form a part of the mysterious stage setting of mournful scenes the child a little girl was going and coming running to warm herself laughing singing at the top of her voice alas in what are the plays of children not intermingled it was this little girl whom fantine heard singing oh she resumed it is my cosette i,LM
1500,recognize her voice the child retreated as it had come the voice died away fantine listened for a while longer then her face clouded over and m madeleine heard her say in a low voice how wicked that doctor is not to allow me to see my daughter that man has an evil countenance that he has but the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again she continued to talk to herself with her head resting on the pillow how happy we are going to be we shall have a little garden the very first thing m madeleine has promised it to me my daughter will play in the garden she must know her letters by this time i will make her spell she will run over the grass after butterflies i will watch her then she will take her first communion ah when will she take her first communion she began to reckon on her fingers one two three four she is seven years old in five years she will have a white veil and openwork stockings she will look like a little woman o my good sister you do not know how foolish i become,LM
1501,when i think of my daughter's first communion she began to laugh he had released fantine's hand he listened to her words as one listens to the sighing of the breeze with his eyes on the ground his mind absorbed in reflection which had no bottom all at once she ceased speaking and this caused him to raise his head mechanically fantine had become terrible she no longer spoke she no longer breathed she had raised herself to a sitting posture her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise her face which had been radiant but a moment before was ghastly and she seemed to have fixed her eyes rendered large with terror on something alarming at the other extremity of the room good god he exclaimed what ails you fantine she made no reply she did not remove her eyes from the object which she seemed to see she removed one hand from his arm and with the other made him a sign to look behind him he turned and beheld javert iii javert satisfied this is what had taken place the half hour after midnight had just struck when m madeleine quitted the hall of assizes in arras he,LM
1502,regained his inn just in time to set out again by the mail wagon in which he had engaged his place a little before six o'clock in the morning he had arrived at m sur m and his first care had been to post a letter to m laffitte then to enter the infirmary and see fantine however he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the court of assizes when the district attorney recovering from his first shock had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of m sur m to declare that his convictions had not been in the least modified by that curious incident which would be explained thereafter and to demand in the meantime the condemnation of that champmathieu who was evidently the real jean valjean the district attorney's persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one of the public of the court and of the jury the counsel for the defence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that in consequence of the revelations of m madeleine that is to say of the real jean valjean the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly,LM
1503,altered and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent man thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas not very fresh unfortunately upon judicial errors etc etc the president in his summing up had joined the counsel for the defence and in a few minutes the jury had thrown champmathieu out of the case nevertheless the district attorney was bent on having a jean valjean and as he had no longer champmathieu he took madeleine immediately after champmathieu had been set at liberty the district attorney shut himself up with the president they conferred as to the necessity of seizing the person of m le maire of m sur m this phrase in which there was a great deal of of is the district attorney's written with his own hand on the minutes of his report to the attorney general his first emotion having passed off the president did not offer many objections justice must after all take its course and then when all was said although the president was a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man he was at the same time a devoted and almost an ardent royalist and he had been shocked to hear,LM
1504,the mayor of m sur m say the emperor and not bonaparte when alluding to the landing at cannes the order for his arrest was accordingly despatched the district attorney forwarded it to m sur m by a special messenger at full speed and entrusted its execution to police inspector javert the reader knows that javert had returned to m sur m immediately after having given his deposition javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner the messenger himself was a very clever member of the police who in two words informed javert of what had taken place at arras the order of arrest signed by the district attorney was couched in these words inspector javert will apprehend the body of the sieur madeleine mayor of m sur m who in this day's session of the court was recognized as the liberated convict jean valjean any one who did not know javert and who had chanced to see him at the moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary could have divined nothing of what had taken place and would have thought his air,LM
1505,the most ordinary in the world he was cool calm grave his gray hair was perfectly smooth upon his temples and he had just mounted the stairs with his habitual deliberation any one who was thoroughly acquainted with him and who had examined him attentively at the moment would have shuddered the buckle of his leather stock was under his left ear instead of at the nape of his neck this betrayed unwonted agitation javert was a complete character who never had a wrinkle in his duty or in his uniform methodical with malefactors rigid with the buttons of his coat that he should have set the buckle of his stock awry it was indispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes he had come in a simple way had made a requisition on the neighboring post for a corporal and four soldiers had left the soldiers in the courtyard had had fantine's room pointed out to him by the portress who was utterly unsuspicious accustomed as she was to seeing armed men inquiring for the mayor on arriving at fantine's chamber javert turned the handle pushed the,LM
1506,door open with the gentleness of a sick nurse or a police spy and entered properly speaking he did not enter he stood erect in the half open door his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat which was buttoned up to the chin in the bend of his elbow the leaden head of his enormous cane which was hidden behind him could be seen thus he remained for nearly a minute without his presence being perceived all at once fantine raised her eyes saw him and made m madeleine turn round the instant that madeleine's glance encountered javert's glance javert without stirring without moving from his post without approaching him became terrible no human sentiment can be as terrible as joy it was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul the satisfaction of at last getting hold of jean valjean caused all that was in his soul to appear in his countenance the depths having been stirred up mounted to the surface the humiliation of having in some slight degree lost the scent and of having indulged for a few moments in an error with regard to champmathieu was,LM
1507,effaced by pride at having so well and accurately divined in the first place and of having for so long cherished a just instinct javert's content shone forth in his sovereign attitude the deformity of triumph overspread that narrow brow all the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied face can afford were there javert was in heaven at that moment without putting the thing clearly to himself but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his presence and of his success he javert personified justice light and truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil behind him and around him at an infinite distance he had authority reason the case judged the legal conscience the public prosecution all the stars he was protecting order he was causing the law to yield up its thunders he was avenging society he was lending a helping hand to the absolute he was standing erect in the midst of a glory there existed in his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat erect haughty brilliant he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel the terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused the vague,LM
1508,flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched fist happy and indignant he held his heel upon crime vice rebellion perdition hell he was radiant he exterminated he smiled and there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous saint michael javert though frightful had nothing ignoble about him probity sincerity candor conviction the sense of duty are things which may become hideous when wrongly directed but which even when hideous remain grand their majesty the majesty peculiar to the human conscience clings to them in the midst of horror they are virtues which have one vice error the honest pitiless joy of a fanatic in the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously venerable radiance without himself suspecting the fact javert in his formidable happiness was to be pitied as is every ignorant man who triumphs nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the good iv authority reasserts its rights fantine had not seen javert since the day on which the mayor had torn her from the man her ailing brain comprehended nothing but the only thing which she,LM
1509,did not doubt was that he had come to get her she could not endure that terrible face she felt her life quitting her she hid her face in both hands and shrieked in her anguish monsieur madeleine save me jean valjean we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise had risen he said to fantine in the gentlest and calmest of voices be at ease it is not for you that he is come then he addressed javert and said i know what you want javert replied be quick about it there lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these words something indescribably fierce and frenzied javert did not say be quick about it he said bequiabouit no orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered it was no longer a human word it was a roar he did not proceed according to his custom he did not enter into the matter he exhibited no warrant of arrest in his eyes jean valjean was a sort of mysterious combatant who was not to be laid hands upon a wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five years,LM
1510,without being able to throw him this arrest was not a beginning but an end he confined himself to saying be quick about it as he spoke thus he did not advance a single step he hurled at jean valjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling hook and with which he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him it was this glance which fantine had felt penetrating to the very marrow of her bones two months previously at javert's exclamation fantine opened her eyes once more but the mayor was there what had she to fear javert advanced to the middle of the room and cried see here now art thou coming the unhappy woman glanced about her no one was present excepting the nun and the mayor to whom could that abject use of thou be addressed to her only she shuddered then she beheld a most unprecedented thing a thing so unprecedented that nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest deliriums of fever she beheld javert the police spy seize the mayor by the collar she saw the mayor bow his head it seemed to her that the world,LM
1511,was coming to an end javert had in fact grasped jean valjean by the collar monsieur le maire shrieked fantine javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all his gums there is no longer any monsieur le maire here jean valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the collar of his coat he said javert javert interrupted him call me mr inspector monsieur said jean valjean i should like to say a word to you in private aloud say it aloud replied javert people are in the habit of talking aloud to me jean valjean went on in a lower tone i have a request to make of you i tell you to speak loud but you alone should hear it what difference does that make to me i shall not listen jean valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very low voice grant me three days grace three days in which to go and fetch the child of this unhappy woman i will pay whatever is necessary you shall accompany me if you choose you are making sport of me cried javert come now i did not think you,LM
1512,such a fool you ask me to give you three days in which to run away you say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature's child ah ah that's good that's really capital fantine was seized with a fit of trembling my child she cried to go and fetch my child she is not here then answer me sister where is cosette i want my child monsieur madeleine monsieur le maire javert stamped his foot and now there's the other one will you hold your tongue you hussy it's a pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates and where women of the town are cared for like countesses ah but we are going to change all that it is high time he stared intently at fantine and added once more taking into his grasp jean valjean's cravat shirt and collar i tell you that there is no monsieur madeleine and that there is no monsieur le maire there is a thief a brigand a convict named jean valjean and i have him in my grasp that's what there is fantine raised herself in bed with a bound supporting herself on her stiffened arms and on,LM
1513,both hands she gazed at jean valjean she gazed at javert she gazed at the nun she opened her mouth as though to speak a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat her teeth chattered she stretched out her arms in her agony opening her hands convulsively and fumbling about her like a drowning person then suddenly fell back on her pillow her head struck the head board of the bed and fell forwards on her breast with gaping mouth and staring sightless eyes she was dead jean valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of javert and opened it as he would have opened the hand of a baby then he said to javert you have murdered that woman let's have an end of this shouted javert in a fury i am not here to listen to argument let us economize all that the guard is below march on instantly or you'll get the thumb screws in the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead which was in a decidedly decrepit state and which served the sisters as a camp bed when they were watching with the sick jean valjean stepped up to this bed,LM
1514,in a twinkling wrenched off the head piece which was already in a dilapidated condition an easy matter to muscles like his grasped the principal rod like a bludgeon and glanced at javert javert retreated towards the door jean valjean armed with his bar of iron walked slowly up to fantine's couch when he arrived there he turned and said to javert in a voice that was barely audible i advise you not to disturb me at this moment one thing is certain and that is that javert trembled it did occur to him to summon the guard but jean valjean might avail himself of that moment to effect his escape so he remained grasped his cane by the small end and leaned against the door post without removing his eyes from jean valjean jean valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed and his brow on his hand and began to contemplate the motionless body of fantine which lay extended there he remained thus mute absorbed evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible pity after a few moments,LM
1515,of this meditation he bent towards fantine and spoke to her in a low voice what did he say to her what could this man who was reproved say to that woman who was dead what words were those no one on earth heard them did the dead woman hear them there are some touching illusions which are perhaps sublime realities the point as to which there exists no doubt is that sister simplice the sole witness of the incident often said that at the moment that jean valjean whispered in fantine's ear she distinctly beheld an ineffable smile dawn on those pale lips and in those dim eyes filled with the amazement of the tomb jean valjean took fantine's head in both his hands and arranged it on the pillow as a mother might have done for her child then he tied the string of her chemise and smoothed her hair back under her cap that done he closed her eyes fantine's face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment death that signifies entrance into the great light fantine's hand was hanging over the side of the bed jean valjean knelt down before that hand lifted it gently and kissed,LM
1516,it then he rose and turned to javert now said he i am at your disposal v a suitable tomb javert deposited jean valjean in the city prison the arrest of m madeleine occasioned a sensation or rather an extraordinary commotion in m sur m we are sorry that we cannot conceal the fact that at the single word he was a convict nearly every one deserted him in less than two hours all the good that he had done had been forgotten and he was nothing but a convict from the galleys it is just to add that the details of what had taken place at arras were not yet known all day long conversations like the following were to be heard in all quarters of the town you don't know he was a liberated convict who the mayor bah m madeleine yes really his name was not madeleine at all he had a frightful name bejean bojean boujean ah good god he has been arrested arrested in prison in the city prison while waiting to be transferred until he is transferred he is to be transferred where is he to be taken he will be tried at the,LM
1517,assizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago well i suspected as much that man was too good too perfect too affected he refused the cross he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he came across i always thought there was some evil history back of all that the drawing rooms particularly abounded in remarks of this nature one old lady a subscriber to the drapeau blanc made the following remark the depth of which it is impossible to fathom i am not sorry it will be a lesson to the bonapartists it was thus that the phantom which had been called m madeleine vanished from m sur m only three or four persons in all the town remained faithful to his memory the old portress who had served him was among the number on the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her lodge still in a thorough fright and absorbed in sad reflections the factory had been closed all day the carriage gate was bolted the street was deserted there was no one in the house but the two nuns sister perpetue and sister simplice who were watching beside the body,LM
1518,of fantine towards the hour when m madeleine was accustomed to return home the good portress rose mechanically took from a drawer the key of m madeleine's chamber and the flat candlestick which he used every evening to go up to his quarters then she hung the key on the nail whence he was accustomed to take it and set the candlestick on one side as though she was expecting him then she sat down again on her chair and became absorbed in thought once more the poor good old woman had done all this without being conscious of it it was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from her revery and exclaimed hold my good god jesus and i hung his key on the nail at that moment the small window in the lodge opened a hand passed through seized the key and the candlestick and lighted the taper at the candle which was burning there the portress raised her eyes and stood there with gaping mouth and a shriek which she confined to her throat she knew that hand that arm the sleeve of that coat it was m madeleine it was several,LM
1519,seconds before she could speak she had a seizure as she said herself when she related the adventure afterwards good god monsieur le maire she cried at last i thought you were she stopped the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in respect towards the beginning jean valjean was still monsieur le maire to her he finished her thought in prison said he i was there i broke a bar of one of the windows i let myself drop from the top of a roof and here i am i am going up to my room go and find sister simplice for me she is with that poor woman no doubt the old woman obeyed in all haste he gave her no orders he was quite sure that she would guard him better than he should guard himself no one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard without opening the big gates he had and always carried about him a pass key which opened a little side door but he must have been searched and his latch key must have been taken from him this point was never explained he ascended the staircase,LM
1520,leading to his chamber on arriving at the top he left his candle on the top step of his stairs opened his door with very little noise went and closed his window and his shutters by feeling then returned for his candle and re entered his room it was a useful precaution it will be recollected that his window could be seen from the street he cast a glance about him at his table at his chair at his bed which had not been disturbed for three days no trace of the disorder of the night before last remained the portress had done up his room only she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two iron ends of the cudgel and the forty sou piece which had been blackened by the fire he took a sheet of paper on which he wrote these are the two tips of my iron shod cudgel and the forty sou piece stolen from little gervais which i mentioned at the court of assizes and he arranged this piece of paper the bits of iron and the coin in such a way that they were the first things,LM
1521,to be seen on entering the room from a cupboard he pulled out one of his old shirts which he tore in pieces in the strips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks he betrayed neither haste nor agitation and while he was wrapping up the bishop's candlesticks he nibbled at a piece of black bread it was probably the prison bread which he had carried with him in his flight this was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room when the authorities made an examination later on there came two taps at the door come in said he it was sister simplice she was pale her eyes were red the candle which she carried trembled in her hand the peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is that however polished or cool we may be they wring human nature from our very bowels and force it to reappear on the surface the emotions of that day had turned the nun into a woman once more she had wept and she was trembling jean valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper which he handed to the nun,LM
1522,saying sister you will give this to monsieur le cure the paper was not folded she cast a glance upon it you can read it said he she read i beg monsieur le cure to keep an eye on all that i leave behind me he will be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial and of the funeral of the woman who died yesterday the rest is for the poor the sister tried to speak but she only managed to stammer a few inarticulate sounds she succeeded in saying however does not monsieur le maire desire to take a last look at that poor unhappy woman no said he i am pursued it would only end in their arresting me in that room and that would disturb her he had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the staircase they heard a tumult of ascending footsteps and the old portress saying in her loudest and most piercing tones my good sir i swear to you by the good god that not a soul has entered this house all day nor all the evening and that i have not even left the,LM
1523,door a man responded but there is a light in that room nevertheless they recognized javert's voice the chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner of the wall on the right jean valjean blew out the light and placed himself in this angle sister simplice fell on her knees near the table the door opened javert entered the whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress were audible in the corridor the nun did not raise her eyes she was praying the candle was on the chimney piece and gave but very little light javert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement it will be remembered that the fundamental point in javert his element the very air he breathed was veneration for all authority this was impregnable and admitted of neither objection nor restriction in his eyes of course the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all he was religious superficial and correct on this point as on all others in his eyes a priest was a mind who never makes a mistake a nun was a creature who never sins they were souls walled in from this world with a,LM
1524,single door which never opened except to allow the truth to pass through on perceiving the sister his first movement was to retire but there was also another duty which bound him and impelled him imperiously in the opposite direction his second movement was to remain and to venture on at least one question this was sister simplice who had never told a lie in her life javert knew it and held her in special veneration in consequence sister said he are you alone in this room a terrible moment ensued during which the poor portress felt as though she should faint the sister raised her eyes and answered yes then resumed javert you will excuse me if i persist it is my duty you have not seen a certain person a man this evening he has escaped we are in search of him that jean valjean you have not seen him the sister replied no she lied she had lied twice in succession one after the other without hesitation promptly as a person does when sacrificing herself pardon me said javert and he retired with a deep bow o sainted maid you left this world many years ago you,LM
1525,have rejoined your sisters the virgins and your brothers the angels in the light may this lie be counted to your credit in paradise the sister's affirmation was for javert so decisive a thing that he did not even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just been extinguished and which was still smoking on the table an hour later a man marching amid trees and mists was rapidly departing from m sur m in the direction of paris that man was jean valjean it has been established by the testimony of two or three carters who met him that he was carrying a bundle that he was dressed in a blouse where had he obtained that blouse no one ever found out but an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few days before leaving behind him nothing but his blouse perhaps that was the one one last word about fantine we all have a mother the earth fantine was given back to that mother the cure thought that he was doing right and perhaps he really was in reserving as much money as possible from what jean valjean had left for the,LM

1630,hideous features one of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the bodies of the dead after the victory the dawn which follows a battle always rises on naked corpses who does this who thus soils the triumph what hideous furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory what pickpockets are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory some philosophers voltaire among the number affirm that it is precisely those persons have made the glory it is the same men they say there is no relief corps those who are erect pillage those who are prone on the earth the hero of the day is the vampire of the night one has assuredly the right after all to strip a corpse a bit when one is the author of that corpse for our own part we do not think so it seems to us impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and purloin the shoes from a dead man one thing is certain which is that generally after conquerors follow thieves but let us leave the soldier especially the contemporary soldier out of the question every army has a rear guard,LM

1635,what that death must have been to so many brave men if there is anything terrible if there exists a reality which surpasses dreams it is this to live to see the sun to be in full possession of virile force to possess health and joy to laugh valiantly to rush towards a glory which one sees dazzling in front of one to feel in one's breast lungs which breathe a heart which beats a will which reasons to speak think hope love to have a mother to have a wife to have children to have the light and all at once in the space of a shout in less than a minute to sink into an abyss to fall to roll to crush to be crushed to see ears of wheat flowers leaves branches not to be able to catch hold of anything to feel one's sword useless men beneath one horses on top of one to struggle in vain since one's bones have been broken by some kick in the darkness to feel a heel which makes one's eyes start from their sockets to bite horses shoes in one's rage to stifle to yell to writhe to be,LM
1636,beneath and to say to one's self but just a little while ago i was a living man there where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death rattle all was silence now the edges of the hollow road were encumbered with horses and riders inextricably heaped up terrible entanglement there was no longer any slope for the corpses had levelled the road with the plain and reached the brim like a well filled bushel of barley a heap of dead bodies in the upper part a river of blood in the lower part such was that road on the evening of the th of june the blood ran even to the nivelles highway and there overflowed in a large pool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way at a spot which is still pointed out it will be remembered that it was at the opposite point in the direction of the genappe road that the destruction of the cuirassiers had taken place the thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned to the depth of the hollow road towards the middle at the point where it became level where delort's division had passed the layer of,LM
1637,corpses was thinner the nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader was going in that direction he was searching that vast tomb he gazed about he passed the dead in some sort of hideous review he walked with his feet in the blood all at once he paused a few paces in front of him in the hollow road at the point where the pile of dead came to an end an open hand illumined by the moon projected from beneath that heap of men that hand had on its finger something sparkling which was a ring of gold the man bent over remained in a crouching attitude for a moment and when he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand he did not precisely rise he remained in a stooping and frightened attitude with his back turned to the heap of dead scanning the horizon on his knees with the whole upper portion of his body supported on his two forefingers which rested on the earth and his head peering above the edge of the hollow road the jackal's four paws suit some actions then coming to a decision he rose to his,LM
1638,feet at that moment he gave a terrible start he felt some one clutch him from behind he wheeled round it was the open hand which had closed and had seized the skirt of his coat an honest man would have been terrified this man burst into a laugh come said he it's only a dead body i prefer a spook to a gendarme but the hand weakened and released him effort is quickly exhausted in the grave well now said the prowler is that dead fellow alive let's see he bent down again fumbled among the heap pushed aside everything that was in his way seized the hand grasped the arm freed the head pulled out the body and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless or at least the unconscious man through the shadows of hollow road he was a cuirassier an officer and even an officer of considerable rank a large gold epaulette peeped from beneath the cuirass this officer no longer possessed a helmet a furious sword cut had scarred his face where nothing was discernible but blood however he did not appear to have any broken limbs and by some happy chance if,LM
1639,that word is permissible here the dead had been vaulted above him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed his eyes were still closed on his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the legion of honor the prowler tore off this cross which disappeared into one of the gulfs which he had beneath his great coat then he felt of the officer's fob discovered a watch there and took possession of it next he searched his waistcoat found a purse and pocketed it when he had arrived at this stage of succor which he was administering to this dying man the officer opened his eyes thanks he said feebly the abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him the freshness of the night the air which he could inhale freely had roused him from his lethargy the prowler made no reply he raised his head a sound of footsteps was audible in the plain some patrol was probably approaching the officer murmured for the death agony was still in his voice who won the battle the english answered the prowler the officer went on look in my pockets you will find a,LM

1641,months after the surprising events which had taken place at m sur m these articles are rather summary it must be remembered that at that epoch the gazette des tribunaux was not yet in existence we borrow the first from the drapeau blanc it bears the date of july an arrondissement of the pas de calais has just been the theatre of an event quite out of the ordinary course a man who was a stranger in the department and who bore the name of m madeleine had thanks to the new methods resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry the manufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets he had made his fortune in the business and that of the arrondissement as well we will admit he had been appointed mayor in recognition of his services the police discovered that m madeleine was no other than an ex convict who had broken his ban condemned in for theft and named jean valjean jean valjean has been recommitted to prison it appears that previous to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of m laffitte a sum of over half a million which he had lodged,LM
1642,there and which he had moreover and by perfectly legitimate means acquired in his business no one has been able to discover where jean valjean has concealed this money since his return to prison at toulon the second article which enters a little more into detail is an extract from the journal de paris of the same date a former convict who had been liberated named jean valjean has just appeared before the court of assizes of the var under circumstances calculated to attract attention this wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the police he had changed his name and had succeeded in getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns in this town he had established a considerable commerce he has at last been unmasked and arrested thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor he had for his concubine a woman of the town who died of a shock at the moment of his arrest this scoundrel who is endowed with herculean strength found means to escape but three or four days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more in paris itself at the very moment when,LM
1643,he was entering one of those little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of montfermeil seine et oise he is said to have profited by this interval of three or four days of liberty to withdraw a considerable sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers this sum has been estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs if the indictment is to be trusted he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone and it has not been possible to lay hands on it however that may be the said jean valjean has just been brought before the assizes of the department of the var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with violence about eight years ago on the person of one of those honest children who as the patriarch of ferney has said in immortal verse arrive from savoy every year and who with gentle hands do clear those long canals choked up with soot this bandit refused to defend himself it was proved by the skilful and eloquent representative of the public prosecutor that the theft was committed in complicity with others and that jean valjean was a member of,LM
1644,a band of robbers in the south jean valjean was pronounced guilty and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence this criminal refused to lodge an appeal the king in his inexhaustible clemency has deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life jean valjean was immediately taken to the prison at toulon the reader has not forgotten that jean valjean had religious habits at m sur m some papers among others the constitutional presented this commutation as a triumph of the priestly party jean valjean changed his number in the galleys he was called however and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be obliged to recur to the subject the prosperity of m sur m vanished with m madeleine all that he had foreseen during his night of fever and hesitation was realized lacking him there actually was a soul lacking after this fall there took place at m sur m that egotistical division of great existences which have fallen that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished every day obscurely in the human community and which history has noted only once because it occurred after the death,LM

1646,for the benefit of the galleys the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in the arrondissement of m sur m and m de villele called attention to the fact in the rostrum in the month of february ii in which the reader will peruse two verses which are of the devil's composition possibly before proceeding further it will be to the purpose to narrate in some detail a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch in montfermeil and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain conjectures of the indictment there exists in the region of montfermeil a very ancient superstition which is all the more curious and all the more precious because a popular superstition in the vicinity of paris is like an aloe in siberia we are among those who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant here then is the superstition of montfermeil it is thought that the devil from time immemorial has selected the forest as a hiding place for his treasures goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall in secluded nooks of the forest a black man with the air of a carter or,LM
1647,a wood chopper wearing wooden shoes clad in trousers and a blouse of linen and recognizable by the fact that instead of a cap or hat he has two immense horns on his head this ought in fact to render him recognizable this man is habitually engaged in digging a hole there are three ways of profiting by such an encounter the first is to approach the man and speak to him then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant that he appears black because it is nightfall that he is not digging any hole whatever but is cutting grass for his cows and that what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung fork which he is carrying on his back and whose teeth thanks to the perspective of evening seemed to spring from his head the man returns home and dies within the week the second way is to watch him to wait until he has dug his hole until he has filled it and has gone away then to run with great speed to the trench to open it once more and to seize the treasure which the black man has necessarily,LM
1648,placed there in this case one dies within the month finally the last method is not to speak to the black man not to look at him and to flee at the best speed of one's legs one then dies within the year as all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences the second which at all events presents some advantages among others that of possessing a treasure if only for a month is the one most generally adopted so bold men who are tempted by every chance have quite frequently as we are assured opened the holes excavated by the black man and tried to rob the devil the success of the operation appears to be but moderate at least if the tradition is to be believed and in particular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous latin which an evil norman monk a bit of a sorcerer named tryphon has left on this subject this tryphon is buried at the abbey of saint georges de bocherville near rouen and toads spawn on his grave accordingly enormous efforts are made such trenches are ordinarily extremely deep a man sweats digs toils all night for it must be done at,LM
1649,night he wets his shirt burns out his candle breaks his mattock and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole when he lays his hand on the treasure what does he find what is the devil's treasure a sou sometimes a crown piece a stone a skeleton a bleeding body sometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio sometimes nothing this is what tryphon's verses seem to announce to the indiscreet and curious fodit et in fossa thesauros condit opaca as nummas lapides cadaver simulacra nihilque it seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder horn with bullets sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn which has evidently served the devil tryphon does not record these two finds since tryphon lived in the twelfth century and since the devil does not appear to have had the wit to invent powder before roger bacon's time and cards before the time of charles vi moreover if one plays at cards one is sure to lose all that one possesses and as for the powder in the horn it possesses the property of making your gun burst in your face,LM
1650,now a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting attorney that the liberated convict jean valjean during his flight of several days had been prowling around montfermeil it was remarked in that village that a certain old road laborer named boulatruelle had peculiar ways in the forest people thereabouts thought they knew that this boulatruelle had been in the galleys he was subjected to certain police supervision and as he could find work nowhere the administration employed him at reduced rates as a road mender on the cross road from gagny to lagny this boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the inhabitants of the district as too respectful too humble too prompt in removing his cap to every one and trembling and smiling in the presence of the gendarmes probably affiliated to robber bands they said suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall the only thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard this is what people thought they had noticed of late boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone breaking and care of the road at a very early hour and to,LM
1651,betaking himself to the forest with his pickaxe he was encountered towards evening in the most deserted clearings in the wildest thickets and he had the appearance of being in search of something and sometimes he was digging holes the goodwives who passed took him at first for beelzebub then they recognized boulatruelle and were not in the least reassured thereby these encounters seemed to cause boulatruelle a lively displeasure it was evident that he sought to hide and that there was some mystery in what he was doing it was said in the village it is clear that the devil has appeared boulatruelle has seen him and is on the search in sooth he is cunning enough to pocket lucifer's hoard the voltairians added will boulatruelle catch the devil or will the devil catch boulatruelle the old women made a great many signs of the cross in the meantime boulatruelle's manoeuvres in the forest ceased and he resumed his regular occupation of roadmending and people gossiped of something else some persons however were still curious surmising that in all this there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends but some fine windfall of a more serious and palpable,LM
1652,sort than the devil's bank bills and that the road mender had half discovered the secret the most puzzled were the school master and thenardier the proprietor of the tavern who was everybody's friend and had not disdained to ally himself with boulatruelle he has been in the galleys said thenardier eh good god no one knows who has been there or will be there one evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would have instituted an inquiry as to what boulatruelle did in the forest and that the latter would have been forced to speak and that he would have been put to the torture in case of need and that boulatruelle would not have resisted the water test for example let us put him to the wine test said thenardier they made an effort and got the old road mender to drinking boulatruelle drank an enormous amount but said very little he combined with admirable art and in masterly proportions the thirst of a gormandizer with the discretion of a judge nevertheless by dint of returning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few obscure words which he did allow to escape,LM
1653,him this is what thenardier and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out one morning when boulatruelle was on his way to his work at daybreak he had been surprised to see at a nook of the forest in the underbrush a shovel and a pickaxe concealed as one might say however he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and pick of father six fours the water carrier and would have thought no more about it but on the evening of that day he saw without being seen himself as he was hidden by a large tree a person who did not belong in those parts and whom he boulatruelle knew well directing his steps towards the densest part of the wood translation by thenardier a comrade of the galleys boulatruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name this person carried a package something square like a large box or a small trunk surprise on the part of boulatruelle however it was only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes that the idea of following that person had occurred to him but it was too late the person was already in the thicket night had descended,LM
1654,and boulatruelle had not been able to catch up with him then he had adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the woods it was moonlight two or three hours later boulatruelle had seen this person emerge from the brushwood carrying no longer the coffer but a shovel and pick boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass and had not dreamed of accosting him because he said to himself that the other man was three times as strong as he was and armed with a pickaxe and that he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him and on perceiving that he was recognized touching effusion of two old comrades on meeting again but the shovel and pick had served as a ray of light to boulatruelle he had hastened to the thicket in the morning and had found neither shovel nor pick from this he had drawn the inference that this person once in the forest had dug a hole with his pick buried the coffer and reclosed the hole with his shovel now the coffer was too small to contain a body therefore it contained money hence his researches boulatruelle had explored,LM
1655,sounded searched the entire forest and the thicket and had dug wherever the earth appeared to him to have been recently turned up in vain he had ferreted out nothing no one in montfermeil thought any more about it there were only a few brave gossips who said you may be certain that the mender on the gagny road did not take all that trouble for nothing he was sure that the devil had come iii the ankle chain must have undergone a certain preparatory manipulation to be thus broken with a blow from a hammer towards the end of october in that same year the inhabitants of toulon beheld the entry into their port after heavy weather and for the purpose of repairing some damages of the ship orion which was employed later at brest as a school ship and which then formed a part of the mediterranean squadron this vessel battered as it was for the sea had handled it roughly produced a fine effect as it entered the roads it flew some colors which procured for it the regulation salute of eleven guns which it returned shot for shot total twenty two it has been calculated that,LM

1662,of the stars thus against the wind it has its cordage and its canvas against the water wood against the rocks its iron brass and lead against the shadows its light against immensity a needle if one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which taken as a whole constitute the ship of the line one has only to enter one of the six story covered construction stocks in the ports of brest or toulon the vessels in process of construction are under a bell glass there as it were this colossal beam is a yard that great column of wood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach is the main mast taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in the clouds it is sixty fathoms long and its diameter at its base is three feet the english main mast rises to a height of two hundred and seventeen feet above the water line the navy of our fathers employed cables ours employs chains the simple pile of chains on a ship of a hundred guns is four feet high twenty feet in breadth and eight feet,LM
1663,in depth and how much wood is required to make this ship three thousand cubic metres it is a floating forest and moreover let this be borne in mind it is only a question here of the military vessel of forty years ago of the simple sailing vessel steam then in its infancy has since added new miracles to that prodigy which is called a war vessel at the present time for example the mixed vessel with a screw is a surprising machine propelled by three thousand square metres of canvas and by an engine of two thousand five hundred horse power not to mention these new marvels the ancient vessel of christopher columbus and of de ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man it is as inexhaustible in force as is the infinite in gales it stores up the wind in its sails it is precise in the immense vagueness of the billows it floats and it reigns there comes an hour nevertheless when the gale breaks that sixty foot yard like a straw when the wind bends that mast four hundred feet tall when that anchor which weighs tens of thousands is twisted in the jaws of,LM
1664,the waves like a fisherman's hook in the jaws of a pike when those monstrous cannons utter plaintive and futile roars which the hurricane bears forth into the void and into night when all that power and all that majesty are engulfed in a power and majesty which are superior every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immense feebleness it affords men food for thought hence in the ports curious people abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why every day accordingly from morning until night the quays sluices and the jetties of the port of toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers and loungers as they say in paris whose business consisted in staring at the orion the orion was a ship that had been ailing for a long time in the course of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected on its keel to such a degree as to deprive it of half its speed it had gone into the dry dock the year before this in order to have the barnacles scraped off then it had put to sea,LM
1665,again but this cleaning had affected the bolts of the keel in the neighborhood of the balearic isles the sides had been strained and had opened and as the plating in those days was not of sheet iron the vessel had sprung a leak a violent equinoctial gale had come up which had first staved in a grating and a porthole on the larboard side and damaged the foretop gallant shrouds in consequence of these injuries the orion had run back to toulon it anchored near the arsenal it was fully equipped and repairs were begun the hull had received no damage on the starboard but some of the planks had been unnailed here and there according to custom to permit of air entering the hold one morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident the crew was busy bending the sails the topman who had to take the upper corner of the main top sail on the starboard lost his balance he was seen to waver the multitude thronging the arsenal quay uttered a cry the man's head overbalanced his body the man fell around the yard with his hands outstretched towards the abyss on his,LM
1666,way he seized the footrope first with one hand then with the other and remained hanging from it the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth the shock of his fall had imparted to the foot rope a violent swinging motion the man swayed back and forth at the end of that rope like a stone in a sling it was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance not one of the sailors all fishermen of the coast recently levied for the service dared to attempt it in the meantime the unfortunate topman was losing his strength his anguish could not be discerned on his face but his exhaustion was visible in every limb his arms were contracted in horrible twitchings every effort which he made to re ascend served but to augment the oscillations of the foot rope he did not shout for fear of exhausting his strength all were awaiting the minute when he should release his hold on the rope and from instant to instant heads were turned aside that his fall might not be seen there are moments when a bit of rope a pole the branch of a tree is life itself,LM
1667,and it is a terrible thing to see a living being detach himself from it and fall like a ripe fruit all at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agility of a tiger cat this man was dressed in red he was a convict he wore a green cap he was a life convict on arriving on a level with the top a gust of wind carried away his cap and allowed a perfectly white head to be seen he was not a young man a convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had in fact at the very first instant hastened to the officer of the watch and in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew while all the sailors were trembling and drawing back he had asked the officer's permission to risk his life to save the topman at an affirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted to his ankle with one blow of a hammer then he had caught up a rope and had dashed into the rigging no one noticed at the instant with what ease that chain had been,LM
1668,broken it was only later on that the incident was recalled in a twinkling he was on the yard he paused for a few seconds and appeared to be measuring it with his eye these seconds during which the breeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread seemed centuries to those who were looking on at last the convict raised his eyes to heaven and advanced a step the crowd drew a long breath he was seen to run out along the yard on arriving at the point he fastened the rope which he had brought to it and allowed the other end to hang down then he began to descend the rope hand over hand and then and the anguish was indescribable instead of one man suspended over the gulf there were two one would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly only here the spider brought life not death ten thousand glances were fastened on this group not a cry not a word the same tremor contracted every brow all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add the slightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate,LM
1669,men in the meantime the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to a position near the sailor it was high time one minute more and the exhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into the abyss the convict had moored him securely with the cord to which he clung with one hand while he was working with the other at last he was seen to climb back on the yard and to drag the sailor up after him he held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength then he grasped him in his arms and carried him walking on the yard himself to the cap and from there to the main top where he left him in the hands of his comrades at that moment the crowd broke into applause old convict sergeants among them wept and women embraced each other on the quay and all voices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage pardon for that man he in the meantime had immediately begun to make his descent to rejoin his detachment in order to reach them the more speedily he dropped into the rigging and ran along one,LM
1670,of the lower yards all eyes were following him at a certain moment fear assailed them whether it was that he was fatigued or that his head turned they thought they saw him hesitate and stagger all at once the crowd uttered a loud shout the convict had fallen into the sea the fall was perilous the frigate algesiras was anchored alongside the orion and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels it was to be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them four men flung themselves hastily into a boat the crowd cheered them on anxiety again took possession of all souls the man had not risen to the surface he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple as though he had fallen into a cask of oil they sounded they dived in vain the search was continued until the evening they did not even find the body on the following day the toulon newspaper printed these lines nov yesterday a convict belonging to the detachment on board of the orion on his return from rendering assistance to a sailor fell into the sea and was drowned the body has,LM

1672,road to anywhere there people lived and cheaply that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy only water was rare there on account of the elevation of the plateau it was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance the end of the village towards gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds which exist in the woods there the other end which surrounds the church and which lies in the direction of chelles found drinking water only at a little spring half way down the slope near the road to chelles about a quarter of an hour from montfermeil thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water the large houses the aristocracy of which the thenardier tavern formed a part paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business of it and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of supplying montfermeil with water but this good man only worked until seven o'clock in the evening in summer and five in winter and night once come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed he who had no water to drink went to fetch,LM
1673,it for himself or did without it this constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has probably not forgotten little cosette it will be remembered that cosette was useful to the thenardiers in two ways they made the mother pay them and they made the child serve them so when the mother ceased to pay altogether the reason for which we have read in preceding chapters the thenardiers kept cosette she took the place of a servant in their house in this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when it was required so the child who was greatly terrified at the idea of going to the spring at night took great care that water should never be lacking in the house christmas of the year was particularly brilliant at montfermeil the beginning of the winter had been mild there had been neither snow nor frost up to that time some mountebanks from paris had obtained permission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street of the village and a band of itinerant merchants under protection of the same tolerance had constructed their stalls on the church square and even extended them,LM
1674,into boulanger alley where as the reader will perhaps remember the thenardiers hostelry was situated these people filled the inns and drinking shops and communicated to that tranquil little district a noisy and joyous life in order to play the part of a faithful historian we ought even to add that among the curiosities displayed in the square there was a menagerie in which frightful clowns clad in rags and coming no one knew whence exhibited to the peasants of montfermeil in one of those horrible brazilian vultures such as our royal museum did not possess until and which have a tricolored cockade for an eye i believe that naturalists call this bird caracara polyborus it belongs to the order of the apicides and to the family of the vultures some good old bonapartist soldiers who had retired to the village went to see this creature with great devotion the mountebanks gave out that the tricolored cockade was a unique phenomenon made by god expressly for their menagerie on christmas eve itself a number of men carters and peddlers were seated at table drinking and smoking around four or five candles in the public room of thenardier's hostelry this room,LM

1683,that passes before them of everything which has befallen them and who are always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand as a legitimate grievance the sum total of the deceptions the bankruptcies and the calamities of their lives when all this leaven was stirred up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes he was terrible woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time in addition to his other qualities thenardier was attentive and penetrating silent or talkative according to circumstances and always highly intelligent he had something of the look of sailors who are accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses thenardier was a statesman every new comer who entered the tavern said on catching sight of madame thenardier there is the master of the house a mistake she was not even the mistress the husband was both master and mistress she worked he created he directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant magnetic action a word was sufficient for him sometimes a sign the mastodon obeyed thenardier was a sort of special and sovereign being in madame thenardier's eyes though,LM
1684,she did not thoroughly realize it she was possessed of virtues after her own kind if she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with monsieur thenardier which was an inadmissible hypothesis by the way she would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever she would never have committed before strangers that mistake so often committed by women and which is called in parliamentary language exposing the crown although their concord had only evil as its result there was contemplation in madame thenardier's submission to her husband that mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little finger of that frail despot viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side this was that grand and universal thing the adoration of mind by matter for certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty there was an unknown quantity about thenardier hence the absolute empire of the man over that woman at certain moments she beheld him like a lighted candle at others she felt him like a claw this woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her children and who did not fear any one except her,LM

1686,cold and tranquil laugh which was particularly dangerous his theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes he had professional aphorisms which he inserted into his wife's mind the duty of the inn keeper he said to her one day violently and in a low voice is to sell to the first comer stews repose light fire dirty sheets a servant lice and a smile to stop passers by to empty small purses and to honestly lighten heavy ones to shelter travelling families respectfully to shave the man to pluck the woman to pick the child clean to quote the window open the window shut the chimney corner the arm chair the chair the ottoman the stool the feather bed the mattress and the truss of straw to know how much the shadow uses up the mirror and to put a price on it and by five hundred thousand devils to make the traveller pay for everything even for the flies which his dog eats this man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded a hideous and terrible team while the husband pondered and combined madame thenardier thought not of absent creditors took no heed of yesterday,LM

1688,horses must have water four new travellers had arrived cosette was meditating sadly for although she was only eight years old she had already suffered so much that she reflected with the lugubrious air of an old woman her eye was black in consequence of a blow from madame thenardier's fist which caused the latter to remark from time to time how ugly she is with her fist blow on her eye cosette was thinking that it was dark very dark that the pitchers and caraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have been filled and that there was no more water in the cistern she was somewhat reassured because no one in the thenardier establishment drank much water thirsty people were never lacking there but their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather than to the pitcher any one who had asked for a glass of water among all those glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men but there came a moment when the child trembled madame thenardier raised the cover of a stew pan which was boiling on the stove then seized a glass and,LM
1689,briskly approached the cistern she turned the faucet the child had raised her head and was following all the woman's movements a thin stream of water trickled from the faucet and half filled the glass well said she there is no more water a momentary silence ensued the child did not breathe bah resumed madame thenardier examining the half filled glass this will be enough cosette applied herself to her work once more but for a quarter of an hour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snow flake she counted the minutes that passed in this manner and wished it were the next morning from time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street and exclaimed it's as black as an oven or one must needs be a cat to go about the streets without a lantern at this hour and cosette trembled all at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered and said in a harsh voice my horse has not been watered yes it has said madame thenardier i tell you that it has not retorted the pedler cosette had emerged from under the table oh yes,LM
1690,sir said she the horse has had a drink he drank out of a bucket a whole bucketful and it was i who took the water to him and i spoke to him it was not true cosette lied there's a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house exclaimed the pedler i tell you that he has not been watered you little jade he has a way of blowing when he has had no water which i know well cosette persisted and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish and which was hardly audible and he drank heartily come said the pedler in a rage this won't do at all let my horse be watered and let that be the end of it cosette crept under the table again in truth that is fair said madame thenardier if the beast has not been watered it must be then glancing about her well now where's that other beast she bent down and discovered cosette cowering at the other end of the table almost under the drinkers feet are you coming shrieked madame thenardier cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which,LM
1691,she had hidden herself the thenardier resumed mademoiselle dog lack name go and water that horse but madame said cosette feebly there is no water the thenardier threw the street door wide open well go and get some then cosette dropped her head and went for an empty bucket which stood near the chimney corner this bucket was bigger than she was and the child could have set down in it at her ease the thenardier returned to her stove and tasted what was in the stewpan with a wooden spoon grumbling the while there's plenty in the spring there never was such a malicious creature as that i think i should have done better to strain my onions then she rummaged in a drawer which contained sous pepper and shallots see here mam'selle toad she added on your way back you will get a big loaf from the baker here's a fifteen sou piece cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron she took the coin without saying a word and put it in that pocket then she stood motionless bucket in hand the open door before her she seemed to be waiting for some one,LM

1695,merchant so long as she was in boulanger lane and in the neighborhood of the church the lighted stalls illuminated the road but soon the last light from the last stall vanished the poor child found herself in the dark she plunged into it only as a certain emotion overcame her she made as much motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked along this made a noise which afforded her company the further she went the denser the darkness became there was no one in the streets however she did encounter a woman who turned around on seeing her and stood still muttering between her teeth where can that child be going is it a werewolf child then the woman recognized cosette well said she it's the lark in this manner cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted streets which terminate in the village of montfermeil on the side of chelles so long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both sides of her path she proceeded with tolerable boldness from time to time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a shutter this was light,LM
1696,and life there were people there and it reassured her but in proportion as she advanced her pace slackened mechanically as it were when she had passed the corner of the last house cosette paused it had been hard to advance further than the last stall it became impossible to proceed further than the last house she set her bucket on the ground thrust her hand into her hair and began slowly to scratch her head a gesture peculiar to children when terrified and undecided what to do it was no longer montfermeil it was the open fields black and desert space was before her she gazed in despair at that darkness where there was no longer any one where there were beasts where there were spectres possibly she took a good look and heard the beasts walking on the grass and she distinctly saw spectres moving in the trees then she seized her bucket again fear had lent her audacity bah said she i will tell him that there was no more water and she resolutely re entered montfermeil hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to scratch her head again now it was,LM
1697,the thenardier who appeared to her with her hideous hyena mouth and wrath flashing in her eyes the child cast a melancholy glance before her and behind her what was she to do what was to become of her where was she to go in front of her was the spectre of the thenardier behind her all the phantoms of the night and of the forest it was before the thenardier that she recoiled she resumed her path to the spring and began to run she emerged from the village she entered the forest at a run no longer looking at or listening to anything she only paused in her course when her breath failed her but she did not halt in her advance she went straight before her in desperation as she ran she felt like crying the nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely she no longer thought she no longer saw the immensity of night was facing this tiny creature on the one hand all shadow on the other an atom it was only seven or eight minutes walk from the edge of the woods to the spring cosette knew the way through having gone over,LM
1698,it many times in daylight strange to say she did not get lost a remnant of instinct guided her vaguely but she did not turn her eyes either to right or to left for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the brushwood in this manner she reached the spring it was a narrow natural basin hollowed out by the water in a clayey soil about two feet deep surrounded with moss and with those tall crimped grasses which are called henry iv s frills and paved with several large stones a brook ran out of it with a tranquil little noise cosette did not take time to breathe it was very dark but she was in the habit of coming to this spring she felt with her left hand in the dark for a young oak which leaned over the spring and which usually served to support her found one of its branches clung to it bent down and plunged the bucket in the water she was in a state of such violent excitement that her strength was trebled while thus bent over she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into,LM
1699,the spring the fifteen sou piece fell into the water cosette neither saw nor heard it fall she drew out the bucket nearly full and set it on the grass that done she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue she would have liked to set out again at once but the effort required to fill the bucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step she was forced to sit down she dropped on the grass and remained crouching there she shut her eyes then she opened them again without knowing why but because she could not do otherwise the agitated water in the bucket beside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds which were like masses of smoke the tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely over the child jupiter was setting in the depths the child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star with which she was unfamiliar and which terrified her the planet was in fact very near the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist which imparted to it a horrible ruddy hue the mist gloomily,LM
1700,empurpled magnified the star one would have called it a luminous wound a cold wind was blowing from the plain the forest was dark not a leaf was moving there were none of the vague fresh gleams of summertide great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise slender and misshapen bushes whistled in the clearings the tall grasses undulated like eels under the north wind the nettles seemed to twist long arms furnished with claws in search of prey some bits of dry heather tossed by the breeze flew rapidly by and had the air of fleeing in terror before something which was coming after on all sides there were lugubrious stretches the darkness was bewildering man requires light whoever buries himself in the opposite of day feels his heart contract when the eye sees black the heart sees trouble in an eclipse in the night in the sooty opacity there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts no one walks alone in the forest at night without trembling shadows and trees two formidable densities a chimerical reality appears in the indistinct depths the inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant from you with a spectral clearness one beholds floating,LM
1701,either in space or in one's own brain one knows not what vague and intangible thing like the dreams of sleeping flowers there are fierce attitudes on the horizon one inhales the effluvia of the great black void one is afraid to glance behind him yet desirous of doing so the cavities of night things grown haggard taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances obscure dishevelments irritated tufts livid pools the lugubrious reflected in the funereal the sepulchral immensity of silence unknown but possible beings bendings of mysterious branches alarming torsos of trees long handfuls of quivering plants against all this one has no protection there is no hardihood which does not shudder and which does not feel the vicinity of anguish one is conscious of something hideous as though one's soul were becoming amalgamated with the darkness this penetration of the shadows is indescribably sinister in the case of a child forests are apocalypses and the beating of the wings of a tiny soul produces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault without understanding her sensations cosette was conscious that she was seized upon by that black enormity of nature it was no longer terror alone which was,LM
1702,gaining possession of her it was something more terrible even than terror she shivered there are no words to express the strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom of her heart her eye grew wild she thought she felt that she should not be able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow then by a sort of instinct she began to count aloud one two three four and so on up to ten in order to escape from that singular state which she did not understand but which terrified her and when she had finished she began again this restored her to a true perception of the things about her her hands which she had wet in drawing the water felt cold she rose her terror a natural and unconquerable terror had returned she had but one thought now to flee at full speed through the forest across the fields to the houses to the windows to the lighted candles her glance fell upon the water which stood before her such was the fright which the thenardier inspired in her that she dared not flee without that bucket of water she,LM
1703,seized the handle with both hands she could hardly lift the pail in this manner she advanced a dozen paces but the bucket was full it was heavy she was forced to set it on the ground once more she took breath for an instant then lifted the handle of the bucket again and resumed her march proceeding a little further this time but again she was obliged to pause after some seconds of repose she set out again she walked bent forward with drooping head like an old woman the weight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms the iron handle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands she was forced to halt from time to time and each time that she did so the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs this took place in the depths of a forest at night in winter far from all human sight she was a child of eight no one but god saw that sad thing at the moment and her mother no doubt alas for there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their graves she,LM
1704,panted with a sort of painful rattle sobs contracted her throat but she dared not weep so afraid was she of the thenardier even at a distance it was her custom to imagine the thenardier always present however she could not make much headway in that manner and she went on very slowly in spite of diminishing the length of her stops and of walking as long as possible between them she reflected with anguish that it would take her more than an hour to return to montfermeil in this manner and that the thenardier would beat her this anguish was mingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night she was worn out with fatigue and had not yet emerged from the forest on arriving near an old chestnut tree with which she was acquainted made a last halt longer than the rest in order that she might get well rested then she summoned up all her strength picked up her bucket again and courageously resumed her march but the poor little desperate creature could not refrain from crying o my god my god at that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer,LM
1705,weighed anything at all a hand which seemed to her enormous had just seized the handle and lifted it vigorously she raised her head a large black form straight and erect was walking beside her through the darkness it was a man who had come up behind her and whose approach she had not heard this man without uttering a word had seized the handle of the bucket which she was carrying there are instincts for all the encounters of life the child was not afraid vi which possibly proves boulatruelle's intelligence on the afternoon of that same christmas day a man had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the boulevard de l'hopital in paris this man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings and he seemed to halt by preference at the most modest houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg saint marceau we shall see further on that this man had in fact hired a chamber in that isolated quarter this man in his attire as in all his person realized the type of what may be called the well bred mendicant extreme wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness,LM
1706,this is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor and for the man who is very worthy he wore a very old and very well brushed round hat a coarse coat worn perfectly threadbare of an ochre yellow a color that was not in the least eccentric at that epoch a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut black breeches worn gray at the knee stockings of black worsted and thick shoes with copper buckles he would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family returned from the emigration he would have been taken for more than sixty years of age from his perfectly white hair his wrinkled brow his livid lips and his countenance where everything breathed depression and weariness of life judging from his firm tread from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements he would have hardly been thought fifty the wrinkles on his brow were well placed and would have disposed in his favor any one who observed him attentively his lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed severe and which was humble there was in the,LM
1707,depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity in his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel cut from some hedge this stick had been carefully trimmed and had an air that was not too threatening the most had been made of its knots and it had received a coral like head made from red wax it was a cudgel and it seemed to be a cane there are but few passers by on that boulevard particularly in the winter the man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them but this without any affectation at that epoch king louis xviii went nearly every day to choisy le roi it was one of his favorite excursions towards two o'clock almost invariably the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full speed along the boulevard de l'hopital this served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter who said it is two o'clock there he is returning to the tuileries and some rushed forward and others drew up in line for a passing king always creates,LM
1708,a tumult besides the appearance and disappearance of louis xviii produced a certain effect in the streets of paris it was rapid but majestic this impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop as he was not able to walk he wished to run that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning he passed pacific and severe in the midst of naked swords his massive coach all covered with gilding with great branches of lilies painted on the panels thundered noisily along there was hardly time to cast a glance upon it in the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large firm and ruddy face a brow freshly powdered a l'oiseau royal a proud hard crafty eye the smile of an educated man two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat the golden fleece the cross of saint louis the cross of the legion of honor the silver plaque of the saint esprit a huge belly and a wide blue ribbon it was the king outside of paris he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high english,LM
1709,gaiters when he re entered the city he put on his hat and saluted rarely he stared coldly at the people and they returned it in kind when he appeared for the first time in the saint marceau quarter the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade that big fellow yonder is the government this infallible passage of the king at the same hour was therefore the daily event of the boulevard de l'hopital the promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter and probably did not belong in paris for he was ignorant as to this detail when at two o'clock the royal carriage surrounded by a squadron of the body guard all covered with silver lace debouched on the boulevard after having made the turn of the salpetriere he appeared surprised and almost alarmed there was no one but himself in this cross lane he drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an enclosure though this did not prevent m le duc de havre from spying him out m le duc de havre as captain of the guard on,LM
1710,duty that day was seated in the carriage opposite the king he said to his majesty yonder is an evil looking man members of the police who were clearing the king's route took equal note of him one of them received an order to follow him but the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the faubourg and as twilight was beginning to fall the agent lost trace of him as is stated in a report addressed that same evening to m le comte d'angles minister of state prefect of police when the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track he redoubled his pace not without turning round many a time to assure himself that he was not being followed at a quarter past four that is to say when night was fully come he passed in front of the theatre of the porte saint martin where the two convicts was being played that day this poster illuminated by the theatre lanterns struck him for although he was walking rapidly he halted to read it an instant later he was in the blind alley of la planchette and he entered the plat d'etain the,LM
1711,pewter platter where the office of the coach for lagny was then situated this coach set out at half past four the horses were harnessed and the travellers summoned by the coachman were hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle the man inquired have you a place only one beside me on the box said the coachman i will take it climb up nevertheless before setting out the coachman cast a glance at the traveller's shabby dress at the diminutive size of his bundle and made him pay his fare are you going as far as lagny demanded the coachman yes said the man the traveller paid to lagny they started when they had passed the barrier the coachman tried to enter into conversation but the traveller only replied in monosyllables the coachman took to whistling and swearing at his horses the coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak it was cold the man did not appear to be thinking of that thus they passed gournay and neuilly sur marne towards six o'clock in the evening they reached chelles the coachman drew up in front of the carters inn installed in the ancient buildings of the royal abbey,LM
1712,to give his horses a breathing spell i get down here said the man he took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle an instant later he had disappeared he did not enter the inn when the coach set out for lagny a few minutes later it did not encounter him in the principal street of chelles the coachman turned to the inside travellers there said he is a man who does not belong here for i do not know him he had not the air of owning a sou but he does not consider money he pays to lagny and he goes only as far as chelles it is night all the houses are shut he does not enter the inn and he is not to be found so he has dived through the earth the man had not plunged into the earth but he had gone with great strides through the dark down the principal street of chelles then he had turned to the right before reaching the church into the cross road leading to montfermeil like a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before he followed this road,LM
1713,rapidly at the spot where it is intersected by the ancient tree bordered road which runs from gagny to lagny he heard people coming he concealed himself precipitately in a ditch and there waited until the passers by were at a distance the precaution was nearly superfluous however for as we have already said it was a very dark december night not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky it is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins the man did not return to the road to montfermeil he struck across the fields to the right and entered the forest with long strides once in the forest he slackened his pace and began a careful examination of all the trees advancing step by step as though seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone there came a moment when he appeared to lose himself and he paused in indecision at last he arrived by dint of feeling his way inch by inch at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones he stepped up briskly to these stones and examined them attentively through the mists of night as,LM
1714,though he were passing them in review a large tree covered with those excrescences which are the warts of vegetation stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones he went up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk as though seeking to recognize and count all the warts opposite this tree which was an ash there was a chestnut tree suffering from a peeling of the bark to which a band of zinc had been nailed by way of dressing he raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space between the tree and the heap of stones like a person who is trying to assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed that done he took his bearings and resumed his march through the forest it was the man who had just met cosette as he walked through the thicket in the direction of montfermeil he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan depositing a burden on the ground then taking it up and setting out again he drew near and perceived that,LM
1715,it was a very young child laden with an enormous bucket of water then he approached the child and silently grasped the handle of the bucket vii cosette side by side with the stranger in the dark cosette as we have said was not frightened the man accosted her he spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass my child what you are carrying is very heavy for you cosette raised her head and replied yes sir give it to me said the man i will carry it for you cosette let go of the bucket handle the man walked along beside her it really is very heavy he muttered between his teeth then he added how old are you little one eight sir and have you come from far like this from the spring in the forest are you going far a good quarter of an hour's walk from here the man said nothing for a moment then he remarked abruptly so you have no mother i don't know answered the child before the man had time to speak again she added i don't think so other people have mothers i have none and after a silence,LM
1716,she went on i think that i never had any the man halted he set the bucket on the ground bent down and placed both hands on the child's shoulders making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark cosette's thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky what is your name said the man cosette the man seemed to have received an electric shock he looked at her once more then he removed his hands from cosette's shoulders seized the bucket and set out again after a moment he inquired where do you live little one at montfermeil if you know where that is that is where we are going yes sir he paused then began again who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest it was madame thenardier the man resumed in a voice which he strove to render indifferent but in which there was nevertheless a singular tremor what does your madame thenardier do she is my mistress said the child she keeps the inn the inn said the man well i am going to lodge there to night show,LM
1717,me the way we are on the way there said the child the man walked tolerably fast cosette followed him without difficulty she no longer felt any fatigue from time to time she raised her eyes towards the man with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence she had never been taught to turn to providence and to pray nevertheless she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy and which mounted towards heaven several minutes elapsed the man resumed is there no servant in madame thenardier's house no sir are you alone there yes sir another pause ensued cosette lifted up her voice that is to say there are two little girls what little girls ponine and zelma this was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the female thenardier who are ponine and zelma they are madame thenardier's young ladies her daughters as you would say and what do those girls do oh said the child they have beautiful dolls things with gold in them all full of affairs they play they amuse themselves all day long yes sir and you i i work all day long the child raised her great,LM
1718,eyes in which hung a tear which was not visible because of the darkness and replied gently yes sir after an interval of silence she went on sometimes when i have finished my work and they let me i amuse myself too how do you amuse yourself in the best way i can they let me alone but i have not many playthings ponine and zelma will not let me play with their dolls i have only a little lead sword no longer than that the child held up her tiny finger and it will not cut yes sir said the child it cuts salad and the heads of flies they reached the village cosette guided the stranger through the streets they passed the bakeshop but cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch the man had ceased to ply her with questions and now preserved a gloomy silence when they had left the church behind them the man on perceiving all the open air booths asked cosette so there is a fair going on here no sir it is christmas as they approached the tavern cosette timidly touched his arm monsieur what my,LM
1719,child we are quite near the house well will you let me take my bucket now why if madame sees that some one has carried it for me she will beat me the man handed her the bucket an instant later they were at the tavern door viii the unpleasantness of receiving into one's house a poor man who may be a rich man cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll which was still displayed at the toy merchant's then she knocked the door opened the thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand ah so it's you you little wretch good mercy but you've taken your time the hussy has been amusing herself madame said cosette trembling all over here's a gentleman who wants a lodging the thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace a change of aspect common to tavern keepers and eagerly sought the new comer with her eyes this is the gentleman said she yes madame replied the man raising his hand to his hat wealthy travellers are not so polite this gesture and an inspection of the stranger's costume and baggage which the thenardier passed in,LM
1720,review with one glance caused the amiable grimace to vanish and the gruff mien to reappear she resumed dryly enter my good man the good man entered the thenardier cast a second glance at him paid particular attention to his frock coat which was absolutely threadbare and to his hat which was a little battered and tossing her head wrinkling her nose and screwing up her eyes she consulted her husband who was still drinking with the carters the husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger which backed up by an inflation of the lips signifies in such cases a regular beggar thereupon the thenardier exclaimed ah see here my good man i am very sorry but i have no room left put me where you like said the man in the attic in the stable i will pay as though i occupied a room forty sous forty sous agreed very well then forty sous said a carter in a low tone to the thenardier woman why the charge is only twenty sous it is forty in his case retorted the thenardier in the same tone i don't lodge poor folks for less that's true added her husband,LM
1721,gently it ruins a house to have such people in it in the meantime the man laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench had seated himself at a table on which cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass the merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it to his horse himself cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table and her knitting the man who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself observed the child with peculiar attention cosette was ugly if she had been happy she might have been pretty we have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure cosette was thin and pale she was nearly eight years old but she seemed to be hardly six her large eyes sunken in a sort of shadow were almost put out with weeping the corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people her hands were as her mother had divined ruined with chilblains the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her,LM
1722,bones and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent as she was always shivering she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other her entire clothing was but a rag which would have inspired pity in summer and which inspired horror in winter all she had on was hole ridden linen not a scrap of woollen her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried which marked the places where the thenardier woman had touched her her naked legs were thin and red the hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep this child's whole person her mien her attitude the sound of her voice the intervals which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next her glance her silence her slightest gesture expressed and betrayed one sole idea fear fear was diffused all over her she was covered with it so to speak fear drew her elbows close to her hips withdrew her heels under her petticoat made her occupy as little space as possible allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary and had become what might be called the habit of her body,LM
1723,admitting of no possible variation except an increase in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terror lurked her fear was such that on her arrival wet as she was cosette did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself but sat silently down to her work again the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy and at times so tragic that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon as we have stated she had never known what it is to pray she had never set foot in a church have i the time said the thenardier the man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from cosette all at once the thenardier exclaimed by the way where's that bread cosette according to her custom whenever the thenardier uplifted her voice emerged with great haste from beneath the table she had completely forgotten the bread she had recourse to the expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear she lied madame the baker's shop was shut you should have knocked i did,LM
1724,knock madame well he did not open the door i'll find out to morrow whether that is true said the thenardier and if you are telling me a lie i'll lead you a pretty dance in the meantime give me back my fifteen sou piece cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron and turned green the fifteen sou piece was not there ah come now said madame thenardier did you hear me cosette turned her pocket inside out there was nothing in it what could have become of that money the unhappy little creature could not find a word to say she was petrified have you lost that fifteen sou piece screamed the thenardier hoarsely or do you want to rob me of it at the same time she stretched out her arm towards the cat o nine tails which hung on a nail in the chimney corner this formidable gesture restored to cosette sufficient strength to shriek mercy madame madame i will not do so any more the thenardier took down the whip in the meantime the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat without any one having noticed,LM
1725,his movements besides the other travellers were drinking or playing cards and were not paying attention to anything cosette contracted herself into a ball with anguish within the angle of the chimney endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half nude limbs the thenardier raised her arm pardon me madame said the man but just now i caught sight of something which had fallen from this little one's apron pocket and rolled aside perhaps this is it at the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment exactly here it is he went on straightening himself up and he held out a silver coin to the thenardier yes that's it said she it was not it for it was a twenty sou piece but the thenardier found it to her advantage she put the coin in her pocket and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child accompanied with the remark don't let this ever happen again cosette returned to what the thenardier called her kennel and her large eyes which were riveted on the traveller began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before,LM
1726,thus far it was only an innocent amazement but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it by the way would you like some supper the thenardier inquired of the traveller he made no reply he appeared to be absorbed in thought what sort of a man is that she muttered between her teeth he's some frightfully poor wretch he hasn't a sou to pay for a supper will he even pay me for his lodging it's very lucky all the same that it did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor in the meantime a door had opened and eponine and azelma entered they were two really pretty little girls more bourgeois than peasant in looks and very charming the one with shining chestnut tresses the other with long black braids hanging down her back both vivacious neat plump rosy and healthy and a delight to the eye they were warmly clad but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement there was a hint of winter though the springtime was not wholly effaced light emanated from these two little beings,LM
1727,besides this they were on the throne in their toilettes in their gayety in the noise which they made there was sovereignty when they entered the thenardier said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration ah there you are you children then drawing them one after the other to her knees smoothing their hair tying their ribbons afresh and then releasing them with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers she exclaimed what frights they are they went and seated themselves in the chimney corner they had a doll which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter from time to time cosette raised her eyes from her knitting and watched their play with a melancholy air eponine and azelma did not look at cosette she was the same as a dog to them these three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty years between them but they already represented the whole society of man envy on the one side disdain on the other the doll of the thenardier sisters was very much faded very old and much broken but it seemed none,LM
1728,the less admirable to cosette who had never had a doll in her life a real doll to make use of the expression which all children will understand all at once the thenardier who had been going back and forth in the room perceived that cosette's mind was distracted and that instead of working she was paying attention to the little ones at their play ah i've caught you at it she cried so that's the way you work i'll make you work to the tune of the whip that i will the stranger turned to the thenardier without quitting his chair bah madame he said with an almost timid air let her play such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper and who had not the air of being frightfully poor would have been equivalent to an order but that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will was something which madame thenardier did not intend to tolerate she retorted with acrimony,LM
1729,she must work since she eats i don't feed her to do nothing what is she making went on the stranger in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter's shoulders the thenardier deigned to reply stockings if you please stockings for my little girls who have none so to speak and who are absolutely barefoot just now the man looked at cosette's poor little red feet and continued when will she have finished this pair of stockings she has at least three or four good days work on them still the lazy creature and how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them the thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him thirty sous at least will you sell them for five francs went on the man good heavens exclaimed a carter who was listening with a loud laugh five francs the deuce i should think so five balls thenardier thought it time to strike in yes sir if such is your fancy you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs we can refuse nothing to travellers you must pay on the spot said,LM
1730,the thenardier in her curt and peremptory fashion i will buy that pair of stockings replied the man and he added drawing a five franc piece from his pocket and laying it on the table i will pay for them then he turned to cosette now i own your work play my child the carter was so much touched by the five franc piece that he abandoned his glass and hastened up but it's true he cried examining it a real hind wheel and not counterfeit thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket the thenardier had no reply to make she bit her lips and her face assumed an expression of hatred in the meantime cosette was trembling she ventured to ask is it true madame may i play play said the thenardier in a terrible voice thanks madame said cosette and while her mouth thanked the thenardier her whole little soul thanked the traveller thenardier had resumed his drinking his wife whispered in his ear who can this yellow man be i have seen millionaires with coats like that replied thenardier in a sovereign manner cosette had dropped her knitting but had not left her seat,LM
1731,cosette always moved as little as possible she picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her eponine and azelma paid no attention to what was going on they had just executed a very important operation they had just got hold of the cat they had thrown their doll on the ground and eponine who was the elder was swathing the little cat in spite of its mewing and its contortions in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps while performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children whose grace like the splendor of the butterfly's wing vanishes when one essays to fix it fast you see sister this doll is more amusing than the other she twists she cries she is warm see sister let us play with her she shall be my little girl i will be a lady i will come to see you and you shall look at her gradually you will perceive her whiskers and that will surprise you and then you will see her ears and then you will see her tail and it,LM
1732,will amaze you and you will say to me ah mon dieu and i will say to you yes madame it is my little girl little girls are made like that just at present azelma listened admiringly to eponine in the meantime the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook thenardier accompanied and encouraged them as birds make nests out of everything so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand while eponine and azelma were bundling up the cat cosette on her side had dressed up her sword that done she laid it in her arms and sang to it softly to lull it to sleep the doll is one of the most imperious needs and at the same time one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood to care for to clothe to deck to dress to undress to redress to teach scold a little to rock to dandle to lull to sleep to imagine that something is some one therein lies the whole woman's future while dreaming and chattering making tiny outfits and baby clothes while sewing little gowns and corsages and bodices,LM
1733,the child grows into a young girl the young girl into a big girl the big girl into a woman the first child is the continuation of the last doll a little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy and quite as impossible as a woman without children so cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword madame thenardier approached the yellow man my husband is right she thought perhaps it is m laffitte there are such queer rich men she came and set her elbows on the table monsieur said she at this word monsieur the man turned up to that time the thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme you see sir she pursued assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien i am willing that the child should play i do not oppose it but it is good for once because you are generous you see she has nothing she must needs work then this child is not yours demanded the man oh mon dieu no sir she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity a sort of imbecile child,LM
1734,she must have water on the brain she has a large head as you see we do what we can for her for we are not rich we have written in vain to her native place and have received no reply these six months it must be that her mother is dead ah said the man and fell into his revery once more her mother didn't amount to much added the thenardier she abandoned her child during the whole of this conversation cosette as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion had not taken her eyes from the thenardier's face she listened vaguely she caught a few words here and there meanwhile the drinkers all three quarters intoxicated were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety it was a highly spiced and wanton song in which the virgin and the infant jesus were introduced the thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter cosette from her post under the table gazed at the fire which was reflected from her fixed eyes she had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made and as she rocked it she sang in a low,LM
1735,voice my mother is dead my mother is dead my mother is dead on being urged afresh by the hostess the yellow man the millionaire consented at last to take supper what does monsieur wish bread and cheese said the man decidedly he is a beggar thought madame thenardier the drunken men were still singing their song and the child under the table was singing hers all at once cosette paused she had just turned round and caught sight of the little thenardiers doll which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table then she dropped the swaddled sword which only half met her needs and cast her eyes slowly round the room madame thenardier was whispering to her husband and counting over some money ponine and zelma were playing with the cat the travellers were eating or drinking or singing not a glance was fixed on her she had not a moment to lose she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees made sure once more that no one was watching her then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it an,LM
1736,instant later she was in her place again seated motionless and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms the happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness no one had seen her except the traveller who was slowly devouring his meagre supper this joy lasted about a quarter of an hour but with all the precautions that cosette had taken she did not perceive that one of the doll's legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth lighted it up very vividly that pink and shining foot projecting from the shadow suddenly struck the eye of azelma who said to eponine look sister the two little girls paused in stupefaction cosette had dared to take their doll eponine rose and without releasing the cat she ran to her mother and began to tug at her skirt let me alone said her mother what do you want mother said the child look there and she pointed to cosette cosette absorbed in the ecstasies of possession no longer saw or heard anything madame thenardier's countenance assumed that peculiar expression,LM
1737,which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life and which has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras on this occasion wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further cosette had overstepped all bounds cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to these young ladies a czarina who should see a muzhik trying on her imperial son's blue ribbon would wear no other face she shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation cosette cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her she turned round cosette repeated the thenardier cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration mingled with despair then without taking her eyes from it she clasped her hands and what is terrible to relate of a child of that age she wrung them then not one of the emotions of the day neither the trip to the forest nor the weight of the bucket of water nor the loss of the money nor the sight of the whip nor even the sad words which she had heard madame thenardier utter had been able to wring this from her she wept,LM
1738,she burst out sobbing meanwhile the traveller had risen to his feet what is the matter he said to the thenardier don't you see said the thenardier pointing to the corpus delicti which lay at cosette's feet well what of it resumed the man that beggar replied the thenardier has permitted herself to touch the children's doll all this noise for that said the man well what if she did play with that doll she touched it with her dirty hands pursued the thenardier with her frightful hands here cosette redoubled her sobs will you stop your noise screamed the thenardier the man went straight to the street door opened it and stepped out as soon as he had gone the thenardier profited by his absence to give cosette a hearty kick under the table which made the child utter loud cries the door opened again the man re appeared he carried in both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning and he set it upright in front of cosette saying here this is for you it must be supposed that in the course of,LM
1739,the hour and more which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that toy shop lighted up by fire pots and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the drinking shop cosette raised her eyes she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun she heard the unprecedented words it is for you she stared at him she stared at the doll then she slowly retreated and hid herself at the extreme end under the table in a corner of the wall she no longer cried she no longer wept she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe the thenardier eponine and azelma were like statues also the very drinkers had paused a solemn silence reigned through the whole room madame thenardier petrified and mute recommenced her conjectures who is that old fellow is he a poor man is he a millionaire perhaps he is both that is to say a thief the face of the male thenardier presented that expressive fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its,LM
1740,bestial force the tavern keeper stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller he seemed to be scenting out the man as he would have scented out a bag of money this did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning he stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice that machine costs at least thirty francs no nonsense down on your belly before that man gross natures have this in common with naive natures that they possess no transition state well cosette said the thenardier in a voice that strove to be sweet and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women aren't you going to take your doll cosette ventured to emerge from her hole the gentleman has given you a doll my little cosette said thenardier with a caressing air take it it is yours cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror her face was still flooded with tears but her eyes began to fill like the sky at daybreak with strange beams of joy what she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she,LM
1741,had been abruptly told little one you are the queen of france it seemed to her that if she touched that doll lightning would dart from it this was true up to a certain point for she said to herself that the thenardier would scold and beat her nevertheless the attraction carried the day she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier may i madame no words can render that air at once despairing terrified and ecstatic pardi cried the thenardier it is yours the gentleman has given it to you truly sir said cosette is it true is the lady mine the stranger's eyes seemed to be full of tears he appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should weep he nodded to cosette and placed the lady's hand in her tiny hand cosette hastily withdrew her hand as though that of the lady scorched her and began to stare at the floor we are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately all at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport i,LM
1742,shall call her catherine she said it was an odd moment when cosette's rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll madame she resumed may i put her on a chair yes my child replied the thenardier it was now the turn of eponine and azelma to gaze at cosette with envy cosette placed catherine on a chair then seated herself on the floor in front of her and remained motionless without uttering a word in an attitude of contemplation play cosette said the stranger oh i am playing returned the child this stranger this unknown individual who had the air of a visit which providence was making on cosette was the person whom the thenardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment however it was necessary to control herself habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions these emotions were more than she could endure she made haste to send her daughters to bed then she asked the man's permission to send cosette off also for she has worked hard all day she added with a maternal air cosette went off to,LM
1743,bed carrying catherine in her arms from time to time the thenardier went to the other end of the room where her husband was to relieve her soul as she said she exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not utter them aloud old beast what has he got in his belly to come and upset us in this manner to want that little monster to play to give away forty franc dolls to a jade that i would sell for forty sous so i would a little more and he will be saying your majesty to her as though to the duchess de berry is there any sense in it is he mad then that mysterious old fellow why it is perfectly simple replied thenardier if that amuses him it amuses you to have the little one work it amuses him to have her play he's all right a traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it if the old fellow is a philanthropist what is that to you if he is an imbecile it does not concern you what are you worrying for so long as he has,LM
1744,money the language of a master and the reasoning of an innkeeper neither of which admitted of any reply the man had placed his elbows on the table and resumed his thoughtful attitude all the other travellers both pedlers and carters had withdrawn a little and had ceased singing they were staring at him from a distance with a sort of respectful awe this poorly dressed man who drew hind wheels from his pocket with so much ease and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes was certainly a magnificent fellow and one to be feared many hours passed the midnight mass was over the chimes had ceased the drinkers had taken their departure the drinking shop was closed the public room was deserted the fire extinct the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude from time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned that was all but he had not said a word since cosette had left the room the thenardiers alone out of politeness and curiosity had remained in the room is he going to pass the night in that fashion grumbled the thenardier when two o'clock,LM
1745,in the morning struck she declared herself vanquished and said to her husband i'm going to bed do as you like her husband seated himself at a table in the corner lighted a candle and began to read the courrier francais a good hour passed thus the worthy inn keeper had perused the courrier francais at least three times from the date of the number to the printer's name the stranger did not stir thenardier fidgeted coughed spit blew his nose and creaked his chair not a movement on the man's part is he asleep thought thenardier the man was not asleep but nothing could arouse him at last thenardier took off his cap stepped gently up to him and ventured to say is not monsieur going to his repose not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar to repose smacked of luxury and respect these words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day a chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous a chamber in which one reposes costs twenty francs well said the stranger you are right where is your stable sir exclaimed thenardier with a smile i,LM
1746,will conduct you sir he took the candle the man picked up his bundle and cudgel and thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor which was of rare splendor all furnished in mahogany with a low bedstead curtained with red calico what is this said the traveller it is really our bridal chamber said the tavern keeper my wife and i occupy another this is only entered three or four times a year i should have liked the stable quite as well said the man abruptly thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark he lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the chimney piece a very good fire was flickering on the hearth on the chimney piece under a glass globe stood a woman's head dress in silver wire and orange flowers and what is this resumed the stranger that sir said thenardier is my wife's wedding bonnet the traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say there really was a time then when that monster was a maiden thenardier lied however when he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern he had found,LM
1747,this chamber decorated in just this manner and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on his spouse and would result in what the english call respectability for his house when the traveller turned round the host had disappeared thenardier had withdrawn discreetly without venturing to wish him a good night as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning the inn keeper retired to his room his wife was in bed but she was not asleep when she heard her husband's step she turned over and said to him do you know i'm going to turn cosette out of doors to morrow thenardier replied coldly how you do go on they exchanged no further words and a few moments later their candle was extinguished as for the traveller he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner the landlord once gone he threw himself into an arm chair and remained for some time buried in thought then he removed his shoes took one of the two candles blew out the,LM
1748,other opened the door and quitted the room gazing about him like a person who is in search of something he traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase there he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child he followed this sound and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase or rather formed by the staircase itself this recess was nothing else than the space under the steps there in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds among dust and spiders webs was a bed if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to display the straw and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet no sheets this was placed on the floor in this bed cosette was sleeping the man approached and gazed down upon her cosette was in a profound sleep she was fully dressed in the winter she did not undress in order that she might not be so cold against her breast was pressed the doll whose large eyes wide open glittered in the dark from time to time she gave vent,LM
1749,to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking and she strained the doll almost convulsively in her arms beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes a door which stood open near cosette's pallet permitted a view of a rather large dark room the stranger stepped into it at the further extremity through a glass door he saw two small very white beds they belonged to eponine and azelma behind these beds and half hidden stood an uncurtained wicker cradle in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep the stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the thenardier pair he was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the fireplace one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all and which are so cold to look at there was no fire in this one there was not even ashes but there was something which attracted the stranger's gaze nevertheless it was two tiny children's shoes coquettish in shape and unequal in size the traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in,LM
1750,accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on christmas eve there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy eponine and azelma had taken care not to omit this and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth the traveller bent over them the fairy that is to say their mother had already paid her visit and in each he saw a brand new and shining ten sou piece the man straightened himself up and was on the point of withdrawing when far in in the darkest corner of the hearth he caught sight of another object he looked at it and recognized a wooden shoe a frightful shoe of the coarsest description half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud it was cosette's sabot cosette with that touching trust of childhood which can always be deceived yet never discouraged had placed her shoe on the hearth stone also hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing there was nothing in this wooden shoe the stranger fumbled in his waistcoat bent over and placed a louis d'or in,LM
1751,cosette's shoe then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf ix thenardier and his manoeuvres on the following morning two hours at least before day break thenardier seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern pen in hand was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat his wife standing beside him and half bent over him was following him with her eyes they exchanged not a word on the one hand there was profound meditation on the other the religious admiration with which one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind a noise was audible in the house it was the lark sweeping the stairs after the lapse of a good quarter of an hour and some erasures thenardier produced the following masterpiece bill of the gentleman in no supper francs chamber candle fire service total francs service was written servisse twenty three francs cried the woman with an enthusiasm which was mingled with some hesitation like all great artists thenardier was dissatisfied peuh he exclaimed it was the accent of castlereagh auditing france's bill at the congress of vienna monsieur thenardier you,LM
1752,are right he certainly owes that murmured the wife who was thinking of the doll bestowed on cosette in the presence of her daughters it is just but it is too much he will not pay it thenardier laughed coldly as usual and said he will pay this laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority that which was asserted in this manner must needs be so his wife did not insist she set about arranging the table her husband paced the room a moment later he added i owe full fifteen hundred francs he went and seated himself in the chimney corner meditating with his feet among the warm ashes ah by the way resumed his wife you don't forget that i'm going to turn cosette out of doors to day the monster she breaks my heart with that doll of hers i'd rather marry louis xviii than keep her another day in the house thenardier lighted his pipe and replied between two puffs you will hand that bill to the man then he went out hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered thenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the half open,LM
1753,door visible only to his wife the yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand up so early said madame thenardier is monsieur leaving us already as she spoke thus she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air and making creases in it with her nails her hard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it timidity and scruples to present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air of a poor wretch seemed difficult to her the traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent minded he replied yes madame i am going so monsieur has no business in montfermeil no i was passing through that is all what do i owe you madame he added the thenardier silently handed him the folded bill the man unfolded the paper and glanced at it but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere madame he resumed is business good here in montfermeil so so monsieur replied the thenardier stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion she continued in a dreary and lamentable tone oh monsieur times are so hard and then we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood,LM
1754,all the people are poor you see if we had not now and then some rich and generous travellers like monsieur we should not get along at all we have so many expenses just see that child is costing us our very eyes what child why the little one you know cosette the lark as she is called hereabouts ah said the man she went on how stupid these peasants are with their nicknames she has more the air of a bat than of a lark you see sir we do not ask charity and we cannot bestow it we earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal the license the imposts the door and window tax the hundredths monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money and then i have my daughters i have no need to bring up other people's children the man resumed in that voice which he strove to render indifferent and in which there lingered a tremor what if one were to rid you of her who cosette yes the landlady's red and violent face brightened up hideously ah sir my dear sir take her keep her lead,LM
1755,her off carry her away sugar her stuff her with truffles drink her eat her and the blessings of the good holy virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you agreed really you will take her away i will take her away immediately immediately call the child cosette screamed the thenardier in the meantime pursued the man i will pay you what i owe you how much is it he cast a glance on the bill and could not restrain a start of surprise twenty three francs he looked at the landlady and repeated twenty three francs there was in the enunciation of these words thus repeated an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point the thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock she replied with assurance good gracious yes sir it is twenty three francs the stranger laid five five franc pieces on the table go and get the child said he at that moment thenardier advanced to the middle of the room and said monsieur owes twenty six sous twenty six sous exclaimed his wife twenty sous for the chamber resumed thenardier coldly and six sous for his supper as for,LM
1756,the child i must discuss that matter a little with the gentleman leave us wife madame thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected lightning flashes of talent she was conscious that a great actor was making his entrance on the stage uttered not a word in reply and left the room as soon as they were alone thenardier offered the traveller a chair the traveller seated himself thenardier remained standing and his face assumed a singular expression of good fellowship and simplicity sir said he what i have to say to you is this that i adore that child the stranger gazed intently at him what child thenardier continued how strange it is one grows attached what money is that take back your hundred sou piece i adore the child whom do you mean demanded the stranger eh our little cosette are you not intending to take her away from us well i speak frankly as true as you are an honest man i will not consent to it i shall miss that child i saw her first when she was a tiny thing it is true that she costs us money it is true that she,LM
1757,has her faults it is true that we are not rich it is true that i have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses but one must do something for the good god's sake she has neither father nor mother i have brought her up i have bread enough for her and for myself in truth i think a great deal of that child you understand one conceives an affection for a person i am a good sort of a beast i am i do not reason i love that little girl my wife is quick tempered but she loves her also you see she is just the same as our own child i want to keep her to babble about the house the stranger kept his eye intently fixed on thenardier the latter continued excuse me sir but one does not give away one's child to a passer by like that i am right am i not still i don't say you are rich you have the air of a very good man if it were for her happiness but one must find out that you understand suppose that i were to,LM
1758,let her go and to sacrifice myself i should like to know what becomes of her i should not wish to lose sight of her i should like to know with whom she is living so that i could go to see her from time to time so that she may know that her good foster father is alive that he is watching over her in short there are things which are not possible i do not even know your name if you were to take her away i should say well and the lark what has become of her one must at least see some petty scrap of paper some trifle in the way of a passport you know the stranger still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates as the saying goes to the very depths of the conscience replied in a grave firm voice monsieur thenardier one does not require a passport to travel five leagues from paris if i take cosette away i shall take her away and that is the end of the matter you will not know my name you will not know my residence you will not know where she is and my,LM
1759,intention is that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives i break the thread which binds her foot and she departs does that suit you yes or no since geniuses like demons recognize the presence of a superior god by certain signs thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person it was like an intuition he comprehended it with his clear and sagacious promptitude while drinking with the carters smoking and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger watching him like a cat and studying him like a mathematician he had watched him both on his own account for the pleasure of the thing and through instinct and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so doing not a movement not a gesture on the part of the man in the yellow great coat had escaped him even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in cosette thenardier had divined his purpose he had caught the old man's deep glances returning constantly to the child who was this man why this interest,LM
1760,why this hideous costume when he had so much money in his purse questions which he put to himself without being able to solve them and which irritated him he had pondered it all night long he could not be cosette's father was he her grandfather then why not make himself known at once when one has a right one asserts it this man evidently had no right over cosette what was it then thenardier lost himself in conjectures he caught glimpses of everything but he saw nothing be that as it may on entering into conversation with the man sure that there was some secret in the case that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow he felt himself strong when he perceived from the stranger's clear and firm retort that this mysterious personage was mysterious in so simple a way he became conscious that he was weak he had expected nothing of the sort his conjectures were put to the rout he rallied his ideas he weighed everything in the space of a second thenardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance he decided that the moment had arrived,LM
1761,for proceeding straightforward and quickly at that he did as great leaders do at the decisive moment which they know that they alone recognize he abruptly unmasked his batteries sir said he i am in need of fifteen hundred francs the stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather opened it drew out three bank bills which he laid on the table then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the inn keeper go and fetch cosette while this was taking place what had cosette been doing on waking up cosette had run to get her shoe in it she had found the gold piece it was not a napoleon it was one of those perfectly new twenty franc pieces of the restoration on whose effigy the little prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath cosette was dazzled her destiny began to intoxicate her she did not know what a gold piece was she had never seen one she hid it quickly in her pocket as though she had stolen it still she felt that it really was hers she guessed whence her gift had come but the joy which she experienced,LM

1763,no longer alone there was some one there she hastily set about her regular morning duties that louis which she had about her in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen sou piece had fallen on the night before distracted her thoughts she dared not touch it but she spent five minutes in gazing at it with her tongue hanging out if the truth must be told as she swept the staircase she paused remained standing there motionless forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket it was during one of these periods of contemplation that the thenardier joined her she had gone in search of cosette at her husband's orders what was quite unprecedented she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her cosette she said almost gently come immediately an instant later cosette entered the public room the stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it this bundle contained a little woollen gown an apron a fustian bodice a kerchief a petticoat woollen stockings shoes a complete outfit for a girl of seven years all was,LM
1764,black my child said the man take these and go and dress yourself quickly daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of montfermeil who had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a little girl dressed in mourning and carrying a pink doll in her arms pass along the road to paris they were going in the direction of livry it was our man and cosette no one knew the man as cosette was no longer in rags many did not recognize her cosette was going away with whom she did not know whither she knew not all that she understood was that she was leaving the thenardier tavern behind her no one had thought of bidding her farewell nor had she thought of taking leave of any one she was leaving that hated and hating house poor gentle creature whose heart had been repressed up to that hour cosette walked along gravely with her large eyes wide open and gazing at the sky she had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron from time to time she bent down and glanced at it then she looked at the good man,LM
1765,she felt something as though she were beside the good god x he who seeks to better himself may render his situation worse madame thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way as was her wont she had expected great results when the man and cosette had taken their departure thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs is that all said she it was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had dared to criticise one of the master's acts the blow told you are right in sooth said he i am a fool give me my hat he folded up the three bank bills thrust them into his pocket and ran out in all haste but he made a mistake and turned to the right first some neighbors of whom he made inquiries put him on the track again the lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of livry he followed these hints walking with great strides and talking to himself the while that man is evidently a million dressed in yellow and i,LM

1767,that direction they were far in advance of him but a child walks slowly and he walked fast and then he was well acquainted with the country all at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace his steps i ought to have taken my gun said he to himself thenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through our midst without our being aware of the fact and who disappear without our finding them out because destiny has only exhibited one side of them it is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged in a calm and even situation thenardier possessed all that is required to make we will not say to be what people have agreed to call an honest trader a good bourgeois at the same time certain circumstances being given certain shocks arriving to bring his under nature to the surface he had all the requisites for a blackguard he was a shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster satan must have occasionally crouched down in some corner of the,LM

1769,himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of pardon excuse me sir he said quite breathless but here are your fifteen hundred francs so saying he handed the stranger the three bank bills the man raised his eyes what is the meaning of this thenardier replied respectfully it means sir that i shall take back cosette cosette shuddered and pressed close to the old man he replied gazing to the very bottom of thenardier's eyes the while and enunciating every syllable distinctly you are go ing to take back co sette yes sir i am i will tell you i have considered the matter in fact i have not the right to give her to you i am an honest man you see this child does not belong to me she belongs to her mother it was her mother who confided her to me i can only resign her to her mother you will say to me but her mother is dead good in that case i can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing signed by her mother to the effect that i am to hand the,LM
1770,child over to the person therein mentioned that is clear the man without making any reply fumbled in his pocket and thenardier beheld the pocket book of bank bills make its appearance once more the tavern keeper shivered with joy good thought he let us hold firm he is going to bribe me before opening the pocket book the traveller cast a glance about him the spot was absolutely deserted there was not a soul either in the woods or in the valley the man opened his pocket book once more and drew from it not the handful of bills which thenardier expected but a simple little paper which he unfolded and presented fully open to the inn keeper saying you are right read thenardier took the paper and read m sur m march monsieur thenardier you will deliver cosette to this person you will be paid for all the little things i have the honor to salute you with respect fantine you know that signature resumed the man it certainly was fantine's signature thenardier recognized it there was no reply to make he experienced two violent vexations the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for and,LM
1771,the vexation of being beaten the man added you may keep this paper as your receipt thenardier retreated in tolerably good order this signature is fairly well imitated he growled between his teeth however let it go then he essayed a desperate effort it is well sir he said since you are the person but i must be paid for all those little things a great deal is owing to me the man rose to his feet filliping the dust from his thread bare sleeve monsieur thenardier in january last the mother reckoned that she owed you one hundred and twenty francs in february you sent her a bill of five hundred francs you received three hundred francs at the end of february and three hundred francs at the beginning of march since then nine months have elapsed at fifteen francs a month the price agreed upon which makes one hundred and thirty five francs you had received one hundred francs too much that makes thirty five still owing you i have just given you fifteen hundred francs thenardier's sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of,LM
1772,the trap who is this devil of a man he thought he did what the wolf does he shook himself audacity had succeeded with him once monsieur i don't know your name he said resolutely and this time casting aside all respectful ceremony i shall take back cosette if you do not give me a thousand crowns the stranger said tranquilly come cosette he took cosette by his left hand and with his right he picked up his cudgel which was lying on the ground thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the spot the man plunged into the forest with the child leaving the inn keeper motionless and speechless while they were walking away thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders which were a little rounded and his great fists then bringing his eyes back to his own person they fell upon his feeble arms and his thin hands i really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun he said to himself since i was going hunting however the inn keeper did not give up i want to know where he is going said he and he set out to,LM
1773,follow them at a distance two things were left on his hands an irony in the shape of the paper signed fantine and a consolation the fifteen hundred francs the man led cosette off in the direction of livry and bondy he walked slowly with drooping head in an attitude of reflection and sadness the winter had thinned out the forest so that thenardier did not lose them from sight although he kept at a good distance the man turned round from time to time and looked to see if he was being followed all at once he caught sight of thenardier he plunged suddenly into the brushwood with cosette where they could both hide themselves the deuce said thenardier and he redoubled his pace the thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them when the man had reached the densest part of the thicket he wheeled round it was in vain that thenardier sought to conceal himself in the branches he could not prevent the man seeing him the man cast upon him an uneasy glance then elevated his head and continued his course the inn keeper set out again in pursuit thus they continued for,LM

1777,reached a point where it might be said that paris disappeared it was no longer solitude for there were passers by it was not the country for there were houses and streets it was not the city for the streets had ruts like highways and the grass grew in them it was not a village the houses were too lofty what was it then it was an inhabited spot where there was no one it was a desert place where there was some one it was a boulevard of the great city a street of paris more wild at night than the forest more gloomy by day than a cemetery it was the old quarter of the marche aux chevaux the rambler if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this marche aux chevaux if he consented even to pass beyond the rue du petit banquier after leaving on his right a garden protected by high walls then a field in which tan bark mills rose like gigantic beaver huts then an enclosure encumbered with timber with a heap of stumps sawdust and shavings on which stood a large dog barking then a long low utterly dilapidated wall,LM
1778,with a little black door in mourning laden with mosses which were covered with flowers in the spring then in the most deserted spot a frightful and decrepit building on which ran the inscription in large letters post no bills this daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the rue des vignes saint marcel there near a factory and between two garden walls there could be seen at that epoch a mean building which at the first glance seemed as small as a thatched hovel and which was in reality as large as a cathedral it presented its side and gable to the public road hence its apparent diminutiveness nearly the whole of the house was hidden only the door and one window could be seen this hovel was only one story high the first detail that struck the observer was that the door could never have been anything but the door of a hovel while the window if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion the door was nothing but a collection of worm eaten planks roughly bound,LM
1779,together by cross beams which resembled roughly hewn logs it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps muddy chalky plaster stained dusty steps of the same width as itself which could be seen from the street running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls the top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed which served both as wicket and air hole when the door was closed on the inside of the door the figures had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number so that one hesitated where was one above the door it said number the inside replied no number no one knows what dust colored figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening the window was large sufficiently elevated garnished with venetian blinds and with a frame in large square panes only these large panes were suffering from various wounds which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage and the blinds,LM

1789,the door entered closed it again carefully and ascended the staircase still carrying cosette at the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key with which he opened another door the chamber which he entered and which he closed again instantly was a kind of moderately spacious attic furnished with a mattress laid on the floor a table and several chairs a stove in which a fire was burning and whose embers were visible stood in one corner a lantern on the boulevard cast a vague light into this poor room at the extreme end there was a dressing room with a folding bed jean valjean carried the child to this bed and laid her down there without waking her he struck a match and lighted a candle all this was prepared beforehand on the table and as he had done on the previous evening he began to scrutinize cosette's face with a gaze full of ecstasy in which the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration the little girl with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extreme strength and extreme weakness had fallen asleep without knowing with whom she was and continued to,LM
1790,sleep without knowing where she was jean valjean bent down and kissed that child's hand nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother who had also just fallen asleep the same sad piercing religious sentiment filled his heart he knelt beside cosette's bed lt was broad daylight and the child still slept a wan ray of the december sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceiling in long threads of light and shade all at once a heavily laden carrier's cart which was passing along the boulevard shook the frail bed like a clap of thunder and made it quiver from top to bottom yes madame cried cosette waking with a start here i am here i am and she sprang out of bed her eyes still half shut with the heaviness of sleep extending her arms towards the corner of the wall ah mon dieu my broom said she she opened her eyes wide now and beheld the smiling countenance of jean valjean ah so it is true said the child good morning monsieur children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly being themselves by nature joy and happiness cosette caught sight,LM
1791,of catherine at the foot of her bed and took possession of her and as she played she put a hundred questions to jean valjean where was she was paris very large was madame thenardier very far away was she to go back etc etc all at once she exclaimed how pretty it is here it was a frightful hole but she felt free must i sweep she resumed at last play said jean valjean the day passed thus cosette without troubling herself to understand anything was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man iii two misfortunes make one piece of good fortune on the following morning at daybreak jean valjean was still by cosette's bedside he watched there motionless waiting for her to wake some new thing had come into his soul jean valjean had never loved anything for twenty five years he had been alone in the world he had never been father lover husband friend in the prison he had been vicious gloomy chaste ignorant and shy the heart of that ex convict was full of virginity his sister and his sister's children had left him only a vague and far off memory which had,LM
1792,finally almost completely vanished he had made every effort to find them and not having been able to find them he had forgotten them human nature is made thus the other tender emotions of his youth if he had ever had any had fallen into an abyss when he saw cosette when he had taken possession of her carried her off and delivered her he felt his heart moved within him all the passion and affection within him awoke and rushed towards that child he approached the bed where she lay sleeping and trembled with joy he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing poor old man with a perfectly new heart only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light it was the second white apparition which he had encountered the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon cosette caused,LM
1793,the dawn of love to rise the early days passed in this dazzled state cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another being poor little thing she was so little when her mother left her that she no longer remembered her like all children who resemble young shoots of the vine which cling to everything she had tried to love she had not succeeded all had repulsed her the thenardiers their children other children she had loved the dog and he had died after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her it is a sad thing to say and we have already intimated it that at eight years of age her heart was cold it was not her fault it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked alas it was the possibility thus from the very first day all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man she felt that which she had never felt before a sensation of expansion the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the hovel pretty these are the effects,LM
1794,of the dawn of childhood of joy the novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret we all have in our past a delightful garret nature a difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences differing in age alike in sorrow one in fact completed the other cosette's instinct sought a father as jean valjean's instinct sought a child to meet was to find each other at the mysterious moment when their hands touched they were welded together when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as necessary to each other and embraced each other closely taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense we may say that separated from every one by the walls of the tomb jean valjean was the widower and cosette was the orphan this situation caused jean valjean to become cosette's father after a celestial fashion and in truth the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the,LM
1795,forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion but a reality the entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well there he seemed perfectly secure the chamber with a dressing room which he occupied with cosette was the one whose window opened on the boulevard this being the only window in the house no neighbors glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side the ground floor of number a sort of dilapidated penthouse served as a wagon house for market gardeners and no communication existed between it and the first story it was separated by the flooring which had neither traps nor stairs and which formed the diaphragm of the building as it were the first story contained as we have said numerous chambers and several attics only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of jean valjean's housekeeping all the rest was uninhabited it was this old woman ornamented with the name of the principal lodger and in reality intrusted with the functions,LM
1796,of portress who had let him the lodging on christmas eve he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds who was coming there to live with his little daughter he had paid her six months in advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and dressing room as we have seen it was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that hovel cosette laughed chattered and sang from daybreak children have their morning song as well as birds it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand all cracked with chilblains and kissed it the poor child who was used to being beaten did not know the meaning of this and ran away in confusion at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown cosette was no longer in rags she was in mourning she had emerged from misery and she was entering into life jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read sometimes as he made,LM
1797,the child spell he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison this idea had ended in teaching a child to read then the ex convict smiled with the pensive smile of the angels he felt in it a premeditation from on high the will of some one who was not man and he became absorbed in revery good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones to teach cosette to read and to let her play this constituted nearly the whole of jean valjean's existence and then he talked of her mother and he made her pray she called him father and knew no other name for him he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in listening to her prattle life henceforth appeared to him to be full of interest men seemed to him good and just he no longer reproached any one in thought he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man now that this child loved him he saw a whole future stretching out before him illuminated by cosette as by a charming light,LM
1798,the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts at times he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly this is only a personal opinion but to utter our whole thought at the point where jean valjean had arrived when he began to love cosette it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in well doing he had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect incomplete aspects which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth the fate of woman as summed up in fantine and public authority as personified in javert he had returned to prison this time for having done right he had quaffed fresh bitterness disgust and lassitude were overpowering him even the memory of the bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant but after all that sacred memory was growing dim who knows whether jean valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more he loved and grew strong again alas he walked with no less,LM
1799,indecision than cosette he protected her and she strengthened him thanks to him she could walk through life thanks to her he could continue in virtue he was that child's stay and she was his prop oh unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny iv the remarks of the principal tenant jean valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day every evening at twilight he walked for an hour or two sometimes alone often with cosette seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard and entering churches at nightfall he liked to go to saint medard which is the nearest church when he did not take cosette with him she remained with the old woman but the child's delight was to go out with the good man she preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous tete a tetes with catherine he held her hand as they walked and said sweet things to her it turned out that cosette was a very gay little person the old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market they lived soberly always having a little fire but like people in very moderate circumstances jean,LM
1800,valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day he had merely had the glass door leading to cosette's dressing room replaced by a solid door he still wore his yellow coat his black breeches and his old hat in the street he was taken for a poor man it sometimes happened that kind hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him jean valjean accepted the sou with a deep bow it also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him stealthily approached the unfortunate man put a piece of money into his hand often a silver coin and walked rapidly away this had its disadvantages he began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives alms the old principal lodger a cross looking creature who was thoroughly permeated so far as her neighbors were concerned with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons scrutinized jean valjean a great deal without his suspecting the fact she was a little deaf which rendered her talkative there remained to her from her past two,LM
1801,teeth one above the other below which she was continually knocking against each other she had questioned cosette who had not been able to tell her anything since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from montfermeil one morning this spy saw jean valjean with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel she followed him with the step of an old cat and was able to observe him without being seen through a crack in the door which was directly opposite him jean valjean had his back turned towards this door by way of greater security no doubt the old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case scissors and thread then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper which he unfolded the old woman recognized with terror the fact that it was a bank bill for a thousand francs it was the second or third only that she had seen in the course of her existence she fled in alarm a moment later jean,LM
1802,valjean accosted her and asked her to go and get this thousand franc bill changed for him adding that it was his quarterly income which he had received the day before where thought the old woman he did not go out until six o'clock in the evening and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour the old woman went to get the bill changed and mentioned her surmises that thousand franc note commented on and multiplied produced a vast amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the rue des vignes saint marcel a few days later it chanced that jean valjean was sawing some wood in his shirt sleeves in the corridor the old woman was in the chamber putting things in order she was alone cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed the old woman caught sight of the coat hanging on a nail and examined it the lining had been sewed up again the good woman felt of it carefully and thought she observed in the skirts and revers thicknesses of paper more thousand franc bank bills no doubt she also noticed that there were all sorts of things in,LM
1803,the pockets not only the needles thread and scissors which she had seen but a big pocket book a very large knife and a suspicious circumstance several wigs of various colors each pocket of this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter v a five franc piece falls on the ground and produces a tumult near saint medard's church there was a poor man who was in the habit of crouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned and on whom jean valjean was fond of bestowing charity he never passed this man without giving him a few sous sometimes he spoke to him those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police he was an ex beadle of seventy five who was constantly mumbling his prayers one evening as jean valjean was passing by when he had not cosette with him he saw the beggar in his usual place beneath the lantern which had just been lighted the man seemed engaged in prayer according to his custom and was much bent over jean valjean,LM
1804,stepped up to him and placed his customary alms in his hand the mendicant raised his eyes suddenly stared intently at jean valjean then dropped his head quickly this movement was like a flash of lightning jean valjean was seized with a shudder it seemed to him that he had just caught sight by the light of the street lantern not of the placid and beaming visage of the old beadle but of a well known and startling face he experienced the same impression that one would have on finding one's self all of a sudden face to face in the dark with a tiger he recoiled terrified petrified daring neither to breathe to speak to remain nor to flee staring at the beggar who had dropped his head which was enveloped in a rag and no longer appeared to know that he was there at this strange moment an instinct possibly the mysterious instinct of self preservation restrained jean valjean from uttering a word the beggar had the same figure the same rags the same appearance as he had every day bah said jean valjean i am mad i am dreaming impossible and he returned profoundly troubled he hardly,LM
1805,dared to confess even to himself that the face which he thought he had seen was the face of javert that night on thinking the matter over he regretted not having questioned the man in order to force him to raise his head a second time on the following day at nightfall he went back the beggar was at his post good day my good man said jean valjean resolutely handing him a sou the beggar raised his head and replied in a whining voice thanks my good sir it was unmistakably the ex beadle jean valjean felt completely reassured he began to laugh how the deuce could i have thought that i saw javert there he thought am i going to lose my eyesight now and he thought no more about it a few days afterwards it might have been at eight o'clock in the evening he was in his room and engaged in making cosette spell aloud when he heard the house door open and then shut again this struck him as singular the old woman who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself always went to bed at nightfall so that she might not burn,LM
1806,out her candles jean valjean made a sign to cosette to be quiet he heard some one ascending the stairs it might possibly be the old woman who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary's jean valjean listened the step was heavy and sounded like that of a man but the old woman wore stout shoes and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the step of a man as that of an old woman nevertheless jean valjean blew out his candle he had sent cosette to bed saying to her in a low voice get into bed very softly and as he kissed her brow the steps paused jean valjean remained silent motionless with his back towards the door seated on the chair from which he had not stirred and holding his breath in the dark after the expiration of a rather long interval he turned round as he heard nothing more and as he raised his eyes towards the door of his chamber he saw a light through the keyhole this light formed a sort of sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall there was evidently some one there who,LM
1807,was holding a candle in his hand and listening several minutes elapsed thus and the light retreated but he heard no sound of footsteps which seemed to indicate that the person who had been listening at the door had removed his shoes jean valjean threw himself all dressed as he was on his bed and could not close his eyes all night at daybreak just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the end of the corridor then he heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening the step was approaching he sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole which was tolerably large hoping to see the person who had made his way by night into the house and had listened at his door as he passed it was a man in fact who passed this time without pausing in front of jean valjean's chamber the corridor was too dark to allow of the person's face being distinguished but when the man reached the staircase a ray of light from without made it,LM
1808,stand out like a silhouette and jean valjean had a complete view of his back the man was of lofty stature clad in a long frock coat with a cudgel under his arm the formidable neck and shoulders belonged to javert jean valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him through his window opening on the boulevard but he would have been obliged to open the window he dared not it was evident that this man had entered with a key and like himself who had given him that key what was the meaning of this when the old woman came to do the work at seven o'clock in the morning jean valjean cast a penetrating glance on her but he did not question her the good woman appeared as usual as she swept up she remarked to him possibly monsieur may have heard some one come in last night at that age and on that boulevard eight o'clock in the evening was the dead of the night that is true by the way he replied in the most natural tone possible who was it it was a new lodger who has come into the house said the,LM
1809,old woman and what is his name i don't know exactly dumont or daumont or some name of that sort and who is this monsieur dumont the old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes and answered a gentleman of property like yourself perhaps she had no ulterior meaning jean valjean thought he perceived one when the old woman had taken her departure he did up a hundred francs which he had in a cupboard into a roll and put it in his pocket in spite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he might not be heard rattling silver a hundred sou piece escaped from his hands and rolled noisily on the floor when darkness came on he descended and carefully scrutinized both sides of the boulevard he saw no one the boulevard appeared to be absolutely deserted it is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees he went up stairs again come he said to cosette he took her by the hand and they both went out fifth for a black hunt a mute pack i the zigzags of strategy an observation here becomes necessary in view of the,LM
1810,pages which the reader is about to peruse and of others which will be met with further on the author of this book who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself has been absent from paris for many years paris has been transformed since he quitted it a new city has arisen which is after a fashion unknown to him there is no need for him to say that he loves paris paris is his mind's natal city in consequence of demolitions and reconstructions the paris of his youth that paris which he bore away religiously in his memory is now a paris of days gone by he must be permitted to speak of that paris as though it still existed it is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says in such a street there stands such and such a house neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble for his own part he is unacquainted with the new paris and he writes with the old paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him it is,LM
1811,a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country and that all has not vanished so long as you go and come in your native land you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to you that those windows those roofs and those doors are nothing to you that those walls are strangers to you that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard that those houses which you do not enter are useless to you that the pavements which you tread are merely stones later on when you are no longer there you perceive that the streets are dear to you that you miss those roofs those doors and that those walls are necessary to you those trees are well beloved by you that you entered those houses which you never entered every day and that you have left a part of your heart of your blood of your soul in those pavements all those places which you no longer behold which you may never behold again perchance and whose memory you have cherished take on a melancholy charm recur to,LM
1812,your mind with the melancholy of an apparition make the holy land visible to you and are so to speak the very form of france and you love them and you call them up as they are as they were and you persist in this and you will submit to no change for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother may we then be permitted to speak of the past in the present that said we beg the reader to take note of it and we continue jean valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets taking the most intricate lines which he could devise returning on his track at times to make sure that he was not being followed this manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag on soil where an imprint of the track may be left this manoeuvre possesses among other advantages that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs by throwing them on the wrong scent in venery this is called false re imbushment the moon was full that night jean valjean was not sorry for this the moon still very close to the horizon,LM
1813,cast great masses of light and shadow in the streets jean valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark side and yet keep watch on the light side he did not perhaps take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the dark side escaped him still in the deserted lanes which lie near the rue poliveau he thought he felt certain that no one was following him cosette walked on without asking any questions the sufferings of the first six years of her life had instilled something passive into her nature moreover and this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to recur she had grown used without being herself aware of it to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of destiny and then she was with him and she felt safe jean valjean knew no more where he was going than did cosette he trusted in god as she trusted in him it seemed as though he also were clinging to the hand of some one greater than himself he thought he felt a being leading him though invisible however he had no settled idea no plan no project he,LM
1814,was not even absolutely sure that it was javert and then it might have been javert without javert knowing that he was jean valjean was not he disguised was not he believed to be dead still queer things had been going on for several days he wanted no more of them he was determined not to return to the gorbeau house like the wild animal chased from its lair he was seeking a hole in which he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell jean valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the mouffetard quarter which was already asleep as though the discipline of the middle ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed he combined in various manners with cunning strategy the rue censier and the rue copeau the rue du battoir saint and the rue du puits l'ermite there are lodging houses in this locality but he did not even enter one finding nothing which suited him he had no doubt that if any one had chanced to be upon his track they would have lost it as eleven o'clock struck from saint etienne du mont he was traversing the rue de pontoise,LM
1815,in front of the office of the commissary of police situated at no a few moments later the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round at that moment he saw distinctly thanks to the commissary's lantern which betrayed them three men who were following him closely pass one after the other under that lantern on the dark side of the street one of the three entered the alley leading to the commissary's house the one who marched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious come child he said to cosette and he made haste to quit the rue pontoise he took a circuit turned into the passage des patriarches which was closed on account of the hour strode along the rue de l'epee de bois and the rue de l'arbalete and plunged into the rue des postes at that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets where the college rollin stands to day and where the rue neuve sainte genevieve turns off it is understood of course that the rue neuve sainte genevieve is an old street and that a posting chaise does not pass through the rue des postes once,LM
1816,in ten years in the thirteenth century this rue des postes was inhabited by potters and its real name is rue des pots the moon cast a livid light into this open space jean valjean went into ambush in a doorway calculating that if the men were still following him he could not fail to get a good look at them as they traversed this illuminated space in point of fact three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their appearance there were four of them now all were tall dressed in long brown coats with round hats and huge cudgels in their hands their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness one would have pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois they halted in the middle of the space and formed a group like men in consultation they had an air of indecision the one who appeared to be their leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the direction which jean valjean had taken another seemed to indicate the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy at the moment when the first man wheeled,LM
1817,round the moon fell full in his face jean valjean recognized javert perfectly ii it is lucky that the pont d'austerlitz bears carriages uncertainty was at an end for jean valjean fortunately it still lasted for the men he took advantage of their hesitation it was time lost for them but gained for him he slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself and went down the rue des postes towards the region of the jardin des plantes cosette was beginning to be tired he took her in his arms and carried her there were no passers by and the street lanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon he redoubled his pace in a few strides he had reached the goblet potteries on the front of which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient inscription de goblet fils c'est ici la fabrique venez choisir des cruches et des broos des pots a fleurs des tuyaux de la brique a tout venant le coeur vend des carreaux he left behind him the rue de la clef then the fountain saint skirted the jardin des plantes by the lower streets and reached the quay there,LM
1818,he turned round the quay was deserted the streets were deserted there was no one behind him he drew a long breath he gained the pont d'austerlitz tolls were still collected there at that epoch he presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou it is two sous said the old soldier in charge of the bridge you are carrying a child who can walk pay for two he paid vexed that his passage should have aroused remark every flight should be an imperceptible slipping away a heavy cart was crossing the seine at the same time as himself and on its way like him to the right bank this was of use to him he could traverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart towards the middle of the bridge cosette whose feet were benumbed wanted to walk he set her on the ground and took her hand again the bridge once crossed he perceived some timber yards on his right he directed his course thither in order to reach them it was necessary to risk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered and illuminated space he did not hesitate those who were on his track,LM
1819,had evidently lost the scent and jean valjean believed himself to be out of danger hunted yes followed no a little street the rue du chemin vert saint antoine opened out between two timber yards enclosed in walls this street was dark and narrow and seemed made expressly for him before entering it he cast a glance behind him from the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the pont d'austerlitz four shadows were just entering on the bridge these shadows had their backs turned to the jardin des plantes and were on their way to the right bank these four shadows were the four men jean valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured one hope remained to him it was that the men had not perhaps stepped on the bridge and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing the large illuminated space holding cosette by the hand in that case by plunging into the little street before him he might escape if he could reach the timber yards the marshes the market gardens the uninhabited ground which was not built upon it seemed to him that he might commit himself,LM
1820,to that silent little street he entered it iii to wit the plan of paris in three hundred paces further on he arrived at a point where the street forked it separated into two streets which ran in a slanting line one to the right and the other to the left jean valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a y which should he choose he did not hesitate but took the one on the right why because that to the left ran towards a suburb that is to say towards inhabited regions and the right branch towards the open country that is to say towards deserted regions however they no longer walked very fast cosette's pace retarded jean valjean's he took her up and carried her again cosette laid her head on the shoulder of the good man and said not a word he turned round from time to time and looked behind him he took care to keep always on the dark side of the street the street was straight in his rear the first two or three times that he turned round he saw nothing the silence was profound and he continued his march,LM
1821,somewhat reassured all at once on turning round he thought he perceived in the portion of the street which he had just passed through far off in the obscurity something which was moving he rushed forward precipitately rather than walked hoping to find some side street to make his escape through it and thus to break his scent once more he arrived at a wall this wall however did not absolutely prevent further progress it was a wall which bordered a transverse street in which the one he had taken ended here again he was obliged to come to a decision should he go to the right or to the left he glanced to the right the fragmentary lane was prolonged between buildings which were either sheds or barns then ended at a blind alley the extremity of the cul de sac was distinctly visible a lofty white wall he glanced to the left on that side the lane was open and about two hundred paces further on ran into a street of which it was the affluent on that side lay safety at the moment when jean valjean was meditating a turn to the left in an effort to,LM
1822,reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane he perceived a sort of motionless black statue at the corner of the lane and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps it was some one a man who had evidently just been posted there and who was barring the passage and waiting jean valjean recoiled the point of paris where jean valjean found himself situated between the faubourg saint antoine and la rapee is one of those which recent improvements have transformed from top to bottom resulting in disfigurement according to some and in a transfiguration according to others the market gardens the timber yards and the old buildings have been effaced to day there are brand new wide streets arenas circuses hippodromes railway stations and a prison mazas there progress as the reader sees with its antidote half a century ago in that ordinary popular tongue which is all compounded of traditions which persists in calling the institut les quatre nations and the opera comique feydeau the precise spot whither jean valjean had arrived was called le petit picpus the porte saint jacques the porte paris the barriere des sergents,LM
1823,the porcherons la galiote les celestins les capucins le mail la bourbe l'arbre de cracovie la petite pologne these are the names of old paris which survive amid the new the memory of the populace hovers over these relics of the past le petit picpus which moreover hardly ever had any existence and never was more than the outline of a quarter had nearly the monkish aspect of a spanish town the roads were not much paved the streets were not much built up with the exception of the two or three streets of which we shall presently speak all was wall and solitude there not a shop not a vehicle hardly a candle lighted here and there in the windows all lights extinguished after ten o'clock gardens convents timber yards marshes occasional lowly dwellings and great walls as high as the houses such was this quarter in the last century the revolution snubbed it soundly the republican government demolished and cut through it rubbish shoots were established there thirty years ago this quarter was disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings to day it has been utterly blotted out the petit picpus of which no existing plan has,LM
1824,preserved a trace is indicated with sufficient clearness in the plan of published at paris by denis thierry rue saint jacques opposite the rue du platre and at lyons by jean girin rue merciere at the sign of prudence petit picpus had as we have just mentioned a y of streets formed by the rue du chemin vert saint antoine which spread out in two branches taking on the left the name of little picpus street and on the right the name of the rue polonceau the two limbs of the y were connected at the apex as by a bar this bar was called rue droit mur the rue polonceau ended there rue petit picpus passed on and ascended towards the lenoir market a person coming from the seine reached the extremity of the rue polonceau and had on his right the rue droit mur turning abruptly at a right angle in front of him the wall of that street and on his right a truncated prolongation of the rue droit mur which had no issue and was called the cul de sac genrot it was here that jean valjean stood as we have just said on catching sight,LM
1825,of that black silhouette standing on guard at the angle of the rue droit mur and the rue petit picpus he recoiled there could be no doubt of it that phantom was lying in wait for him what was he to do the time for retreating was passed that which he had perceived in movement an instant before in the distant darkness was javert and his squad without a doubt javert was probably already at the commencement of the street at whose end jean valjean stood javert to all appearances was acquainted with this little labyrinth and had taken his precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit these surmises which so closely resembled proofs whirled suddenly like a handful of dust caught up by an unexpected gust of wind through jean valjean's mournful brain he examined the cul de sac genrot there he was cut off he examined the rue petit picpus there stood a sentinel he saw that black form standing out in relief against the white pavement illuminated by the moon to advance was to fall into this man's hands to retreat was to fling himself into javert's arms jean valjean felt himself caught,LM
1826,as in a net which was slowly contracting he gazed heavenward in despair iv the gropings of flight in order to understand what follows it is requisite to form an exact idea of the droit mur lane and in particular of the angle which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the rue polonceau into this lane droit mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right as far as the rue petit picpus by houses of mean aspect on the left by a solitary building of severe outlines composed of numerous parts which grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the rue petit picpus side so that this building which was very lofty on the rue petit picpus side was tolerably low on the side adjoining the rue polonceau there at the angle of which we have spoken it descended to such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall this wall did not abut directly on the street it formed a deeply retreating niche concealed by its two corners from two observers who might have been one in the rue polonceau the other in the rue droit mur beginning with these,LM
1827,angles of the niche the wall extended along the rue polonceau as far as a house which bore the number and along the rue droit mur where the fragment was much shorter as far as the gloomy building which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected thus forming another retreating angle in the street this gable was sombre of aspect only one window was visible or to speak more correctly two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed the state of the places of which we are here giving a description is rigorously exact and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the mind of old inhabitants of the quarter the niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and wretched door it was a vast formless assemblage of perpendicular planks the upper ones being broader than the lower bound together by long transverse strips of iron at one side there was a carriage gate of the ordinary dimensions and which had evidently not been cut more than fifty years previously a linden tree showed its crest above the niche and the wall was covered with ivy on the side of,LM
1828,the rue polonceau in the imminent peril in which jean valjean found himself this sombre building had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him he ran his eyes rapidly over it he said to himself that if he could contrive to get inside it he might save himself first he conceived an idea then a hope in the central portion of the front of this building on the rue droit mur side there were at all the windows of the different stories ancient cistern pipes of lead the various branches of the pipes which led from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort of tree on the front these ramifications of pipes with their hundred elbows imitated those old leafless vine stocks which writhe over the fronts of old farm houses this odd espalier with its branches of lead and iron was the first thing that struck jean valjean he seated cosette with her back against a stone post with an injunction to be silent and ran to the spot where the conduit touched the pavement perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it and entering the house but the,LM
1829,pipe was dilapidated and past service and hardly hung to its fastenings moreover all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars even the attic windows in the roof and then the moon fell full upon that facade and the man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen jean valjean in the act of climbing and finally what was to be done with cosette how was she to be drawn up to the top of a three story house he gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain pipe and crawled along the wall to get back into the rue polonceau when he reached the slant of the wall where he had left cosette he noticed that no one could see him there as we have just explained he was concealed from all eyes no matter from which direction they were approaching besides this he was in the shadow finally there were two doors perhaps they might be forced the wall above which he saw the linden tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could at least hide himself although there were as yet,LM
1830,no leaves on the trees and spend the remainder of the night time was passing he must act quickly he felt over the carriage door and immediately recognized the fact that it was impracticable outside and in he approached the other door with more hope it was frightfully decrepit its very immensity rendered it less solid the planks were rotten the iron bands there were only three of them were rusted it seemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm eaten barrier on examining it he found that the door was not a door it had neither hinges cross bars lock nor fissure in the middle the iron bands traversed it from side to side without any break through the crevices in the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone roughly cemented together which passers by might still have seen there ten years ago he was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against which it was placed it was easy to tear off a plank but then one found one's self face to face with a wall v which would be,LM
1831,impossible with gas lanterns at that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some distance jean valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street seven or eight soldiers drawn up in a platoon had just debouched into the rue polonceau he saw the gleam of their bayonets they were advancing towards him these soldiers at whose head he distinguished javert's tall figure advanced slowly and cautiously they halted frequently it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of the walls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys this was some patrol that javert had encountered there could be no mistake as to this surmise and whose aid he had demanded javert's two acolytes were marching in their ranks at the rate at which they were marching and in consideration of the halts which they were making it would take them about a quarter of an hour to reach the spot where jean valjean stood it was a frightful moment a few minutes only separated jean valjean from that terrible precipice which yawned before him for the third time and the galleys now meant not only the galleys but cosette lost,LM
1832,to him forever that is to say a life resembling the interior of a tomb there was but one thing which was possible jean valjean had this peculiarity that he carried as one might say two beggar's pouches in one he kept his saintly thoughts in the other the redoubtable talents of a convict he rummaged in the one or the other according to circumstances among his other resources thanks to his numerous escapes from the prison at toulon he was as it will be remembered a past master in the incredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing irons by sheer muscular force by leaning on the nape of his neck his shoulders his hips and his knees by helping himself on the rare projections of the stone in the right angle of a wall as high as the sixth story if need be an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of the wall of the conciergerie of paris by which battemolle condemned to death made his escape twenty years ago jean valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the linden it was about eighteen feet in height the,LM
1833,angle which it formed with the gable of the large building was filled at its lower extremity by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape probably intended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the passers by this practice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use in paris this mass was about five feet in height the space above the summit of this mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen feet the wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping cosette was the difficulty for she did not know how to climb a wall should he abandon her jean valjean did not once think of that it was impossible to carry her a man's whole strength is required to successfully carry out these singular ascents the least burden would disturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards a rope would have been required jean valjean had none where was he to get a rope at midnight in the rue polonceau certainly if jean valjean had had a kingdom he would have given it for a rope at that moment all,LM
1834,extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes dazzle sometimes illuminate us jean valjean's despairing glance fell on the street lantern post of the blind alley genrot at that epoch there were no gas jets in the streets of paris at nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted they were ascended and descended by means of a rope which traversed the street from side to side and was adjusted in a groove of the post the pulley over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box the key to which was kept by the lamp lighter and the rope itself was protected by a metal case jean valjean with the energy of a supreme struggle crossed the street at one bound entered the blind alley broke the latch of the little box with the point of his knife and an instant later he was beside cosette once more he had a rope these gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidly when they are fighting against fatality we have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that night the lantern in the cul de sac genrot was thus naturally extinct like the rest,LM
1835,and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was no longer in its place nevertheless the hour the place the darkness jean valjean's absorption his singular gestures his goings and comings all had begun to render cosette uneasy any other child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks long before she contented herself with plucking jean valjean by the skirt of his coat they could hear the sound of the patrol's approach ever more and more distinctly father said she in a very low voice i am afraid who is coming yonder hush replied the unhappy man it is madame thenardier cosette shuddered he added say nothing don't interfere with me if you cry out if you weep the thenardier is lying in wait for you she is coming to take you back then without haste but without making a useless movement with firm and curt precision the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and javert might come upon him at any moment he undid his cravat passed it round cosette's body under the armpits taking care that it should not hurt the child fastened this cravat to one end of the,LM
1836,rope by means of that knot which seafaring men call a swallow knot took the other end of the rope in his teeth pulled off his shoes and stockings which he threw over the wall stepped upon the mass of masonry and began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as much solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his feet and elbows half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement without uttering a word jean valjean's injunction and the name of madame thenardier had chilled her blood all at once she heard jean valjean's voice crying to her though in a very low tone put your back against the wall she obeyed don't say a word and don't be alarmed went on jean valjean and she felt herself lifted from the ground before she had time to recover herself she was on the top of the wall jean valjean grasped her put her on his back took her two tiny hands in his large left hand lay down flat on his stomach,LM
1837,and crawled along on top of the wall as far as the cant as he had guessed there stood a building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and descended to within a very short distance of the ground with a gentle slope which grazed the linden tree a lucky circumstance for the wall was much higher on this side than on the street side jean valjean could only see the ground at a great depth below him he had just reached the slope of the roof and had not yet left the crest of the wall when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the patrol the thundering voice of javert was audible search the blind alley the rue droit mur is guarded so is the rue petit picpus i'll answer for it that he is in the blind alley the soldiers rushed into the genrot alley jean valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof still holding fast to cosette reached the linden tree and leaped to the ground whether from terror or courage cosette had not breathed a sound though her hands were a little abraded vi the beginning of an enigma jean valjean,LM
1838,found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and of singular aspect one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to be looked at in winter and at night this garden was oblong in shape with an alley of large poplars at the further end tolerably tall forest trees in the corners and an unshaded space in the centre where could be seen a very large solitary tree then several fruit trees gnarled and bristling like bushes beds of vegetables a melon patch whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight and an old well here and there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss the alleys were bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs the grass had half taken possession of them and a green mould covered the rest jean valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a means of descent a pile of fagots and behind the fagots directly against the wall a stone statue whose mutilated face was no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the gloom the building was a sort of ruin where dismantled chambers were distinguishable one of which much,LM
1839,encumbered seemed to serve as a shed the large building of the rue droit mur which had a wing on the rue petit picpus turned two facades at right angles towards this garden these interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior all the windows were grated not a gleam of light was visible at any one of them the upper story had scuttles like prisons one of those facades cast its shadow on the other which fell over the garden like an immense black pall no other house was visible the bottom of the garden was lost in mist and darkness nevertheless walls could be confusedly made out which intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond and the low roofs of the rue polonceau nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined there was no one in it which was quite natural in view of the hour but it did not seem as though this spot were made for any one to walk in even in broad daylight jean valjean's first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put them on again then to step under the shed with cosette,LM
1840,a man who is fleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden the child whose thoughts were still on the thenardier shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible cosette trembled and pressed close to him they heard the tumultuous noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets the blows of their gun stocks against the stones javert's appeals to the police spies whom he had posted and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be distinguished at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that species of stormy roar were becoming more distant jean valjean held his breath he had laid his hand lightly on cosette's mouth however the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm that this frightful uproar close and furious as it was did not disturb him by so much as the shadow of a misgiving it seemed as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones of which the scriptures speak all at once in the midst of this profound calm a fresh sound arose a sound as celestial divine ineffable ravishing as the other had been horrible it was a,LM
1841,hymn which issued from the gloom a dazzling burst of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night women's voices but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children voices which are not of the earth and which resemble those that the newborn infant still hears and which the dying man hears already this song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden at the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated one would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom cosette and jean valjean fell on their knees they knew not what it was they knew not where they were but both of them the man and the child the penitent and the innocent felt that they must kneel these voices had this strange characteristic that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted it was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house while these voices were singing jean valjean thought of nothing he no longer beheld the night he beheld a blue sky it seemed to him that he felt those wings,LM
1842,which we all have within us unfolding the song died away it may have lasted a long time jean valjean could not have told hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment all fell silent again there was no longer anything in the street there was nothing in the garden that which had menaced that which had reassured him all had vanished the breeze swayed a few dry weeds on the crest of the wall and they gave out a faint sweet melancholy sound vii continuation of the enigma the night wind had risen which indicated that it must be between one and two o'clock in the morning poor cosette said nothing as she had seated herself beside him and leaned her head against him jean valjean had fancied that she was asleep he bent down and looked at her cosette's eyes were wide open and her thoughtful air pained jean valjean she was still trembling are you sleepy said jean valjean i am very cold she replied a moment later she resumed is she still there who said jean valjean madame thenardier jean valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to make cosette keep silent,LM
1843,ah said he she is gone you need fear nothing further the child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast the ground was damp the shed open on all sides the breeze grew more keen every instant the goodman took off his coat and wrapped it round cosette are you less cold now said he oh yes father well wait for me a moment i will soon be back he quitted the ruin and crept along the large building seeking a better shelter he came across doors but they were closed there were bars at all the windows of the ground floor just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice he observed that he was coming to some arched windows where he perceived a light he stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows they all opened on a tolerably vast hall paved with large flagstones cut up by arcades and pillars where only a tiny light and great shadows were visible the light came from a taper which was burning in one corner the apartment was deserted and nothing was stirring in it nevertheless by dint of gazing intently he,LM
1844,thought he perceived on the ground something which appeared to be covered with a winding sheet and which resembled a human form this form was lying face downward flat on the pavement with the arms extended in the form of a cross in the immobility of death one would have said judging from a sort of serpent which undulated over the floor that this sinister form had a rope round its neck the whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely illuminated which adds to horror jean valjean often said afterwards that although many funereal spectres had crossed his path in life he had never beheld anything more blood curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place and beheld thus at night it was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive he had the courage to plaster his face to the glass and to watch whether the thing would move in spite of his remaining thus what seemed to him a very long time the outstretched form made no movement all at once he felt himself,LM
1845,overpowered by an inexpressible terror and he fled he began to run towards the shed not daring to look behind him it seemed to him that if he turned his head he should see that form following him with great strides and waving its arms he reached the ruin all out of breath his knees were giving way beneath him the perspiration was pouring from him where was he who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of sepulchre in the midst of paris what was this strange house an edifice full of nocturnal mystery calling to souls through the darkness with the voice of angels and when they came offering them abruptly that terrible vision promising to open the radiant portals of heaven and then opening the horrible gates of the tomb and it actually was an edifice a house which bore a number on the street it was not a dream he had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact cold anxiety uneasiness the emotions of the night had given him a genuine fever and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain he stepped up to cosette she was asleep,LM
1846,viii the enigma becomes doubly mysterious the child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep he sat down beside her and began to think little by little as he gazed at her he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind he clearly perceived this truth the foundation of his life henceforth that so long as she was there so long as he had her near him he should need nothing except for her he should fear nothing except for her he was not even conscious that he was very cold since he had taken off his coat to cover her nevertheless athwart this revery into which he had fallen he had heard for some time a peculiar noise it was like the tinkling of a bell this sound proceeded from the garden it could be heard distinctly though faintly it resembled the faint vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures this noise made valjean turn round he looked and saw that there was some one in the garden a being resembling a man was walking amid the bell glasses of the melon beds rising stooping halting with regular,LM
1847,movements as though he were dragging or spreading out something on the ground this person appeared to limp jean valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy for them everything is hostile and suspicious they distrust the day because it enables people to see them and the night because it aids in surprising them a little while before he had shivered because the garden was deserted and now he shivered because there was some one there he fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors he said to himself that javert and the spies had perhaps not taken their departure that they had no doubt left people on the watch in the street that if this man should discover him in the garden he would cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up he took the sleeping cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture which was out of use in the most remote corner of the shed cosette did not stir from that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon patch the strange thing about it was that the sound of the bell followed each of,LM
1848,this man's movements when the man approached the sound approached when the man retreated the sound retreated if he made any hasty gesture a tremolo accompanied the gesture when he halted the sound ceased it appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man but what could that signify who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox as he put these questions to himself he touched cosette's hands they were icy cold ah good god he cried he spoke to her in a low voice cosette she did not open her eyes he shook her vigorously she did not wake is she dead he said to himself and sprang to his feet quivering from head to foot the most frightful thoughts rushed pell mell through his mind there are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies and violently force the partitions of our brains when those we love are in question our prudence invents every sort of madness he remembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal cosette was pale and had fallen at full length on the ground at,LM
1849,his feet without a movement he listened to her breathing she still breathed but with a respiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction how was he to warm her back to life how was he to rouse her all that was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts he rushed wildly from the ruin it was absolutely necessary that cosette should be in bed and beside a fire in less than a quarter of an hour ix the man with the bell he walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden he had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat the man's head was bent down and he did not see him approaching in a few strides jean valjean stood beside him jean valjean accosted him with the cry one hundred francs the man gave a start and raised his eyes you can earn a hundred francs went on jean valjean if you will grant me shelter for this night the moon shone full upon jean valjean's terrified countenance what so it is you father madeleine said the man that name,LM
1850,thus pronounced at that obscure hour in that unknown spot by that strange man made jean valjean start back he had expected anything but that the person who thus addressed him was a bent and lame old man dressed almost like a peasant who wore on his left knee a leather knee cap whence hung a moderately large bell his face which was in the shadow was not distinguishable however the goodman had removed his cap and exclaimed trembling all over ah good god how come you here father madeleine where did you enter dieu jesus did you fall from heaven there is no trouble about that if ever you do fall it will be from there and what a state you are in you have no cravat you have no hat you have no coat do you know you would have frightened any one who did not know you no coat lord god are the saints going mad nowadays but how did you get in here his words tumbled over each other the goodman talked with a rustic volubility in which there was nothing alarming all this was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness who are,LM
1851,you and what house is this demanded jean valjean ah pardieu this is too much exclaimed the old man i am the person for whom you got the place here and this house is the one where you had me placed what you don't recognize me no said jean valjean and how happens it that you know me you saved my life said the man he turned a ray of moonlight outlined his profile and jean valjean recognized old fauchelevent ah said jean valjean so it is you yes i recollect you that is very lucky said the old man in a reproachful tone and what are you doing here resumed jean valjean why i am covering my melons of course in fact at the moment when jean valjean accosted him old fauchelevent held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed during the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them it was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by jean valjean he continued i said to myself,LM
1852,the moon is bright it is going to freeze what if i were to put my melons into their greatcoats and he added looking at jean valjean with a broad smile pardieu you ought to have done the same but how do you come here jean valjean finding himself known to this man at least only under the name of madeleine thenceforth advanced only with caution he multiplied his questions strange to say their roles seemed to be reversed it was he the intruder who interrogated and what is this bell which you wear on your knee this replied fauchelevent is so that i may be avoided what so that you may be avoided old fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air ah goodness there are only women in this house many young girls it appears that i should be a dangerous person to meet the bell gives them warning when i come they go what house is this come you know well enough but i do not not when you got me the place here as gardener answer me as though i knew nothing well then this is the petit picpus convent memories recurred to jean valjean chance that is,LM
1853,to say providence had cast him into precisely that convent in the quartier saint antoine where old fauchelevent crippled by the fall from his cart had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously he repeated as though talking to himself the petit picpus convent exactly returned old fauchelevent but to come to the point how the deuce did you manage to get in here you father madeleine no matter if you are a saint you are a man as well and no man enters here you certainly are here there is no one but me still said jean valjean i must stay here ah good god cried fauchelevent jean valjean drew near to the old man and said to him in a grave voice father fauchelevent i saved your life i was the first to recall it returned fauchelevent well you can do to day for me that which i did for you in the olden days fauchelevent took in his aged trembling and wrinkled hands jean valjean's two robust hands and stood for several minutes as though incapable of speaking at length he exclaimed oh that would be a blessing from the good god if i could make,LM
1854,you some little return for that save your life monsieur le maire dispose of the old man a wonderful joy had transfigured this old man his countenance seemed to emit a ray of light what do you wish me to do he resumed that i will explain to you you have a chamber i have an isolated hovel yonder behind the ruins of the old convent in a corner which no one ever looks into there are three rooms in it the hut was in fact so well hidden behind the ruins and so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen that jean valjean had not perceived it good said jean valjean now i am going to ask two things of you what are they mr mayor in the first place you are not to tell any one what you know about me in the second you are not to try to find out anything more as you please i know that you can do nothing that is not honest that you have always been a man after the good god's heart and then moreover you it was who placed me here that concerns you i am at your service,LM
1855,that is settled then now come with me we will go and get the child ah said fauchelevent so there is a child he added not a word further and followed jean valjean as a dog follows his master less than half an hour afterwards cosette who had grown rosy again before the flame of a good fire was lying asleep in the old gardener's bed jean valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more his hat which he had flung over the wall had been found and picked up while jean valjean was putting on his coat fauchelevent had removed the bell and kneecap which now hung on a nail beside a vintage basket that adorned the wall the two men were warming themselves with their elbows resting on a table upon which fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese black bread a bottle of wine and two glasses and the old man was saying to jean valjean as he laid his hand on the latter's knee ah father madeleine you did not recognize me immediately you save people's lives and then you forget them that is bad but they remember you you are an ingrate x,LM
1856,which explains how javert got on the scent the events of which we have just beheld the reverse side so to speak had come about in the simplest possible manner when jean valjean on the evening of the very day when javert had arrested him beside fantine's death bed had escaped from the town jail of m sur m the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to paris paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost and everything disappears in this belly of the world as in the belly of the sea no forest hides a man as does that crowd fugitives of every sort know this they go to paris as to an abyss there are gulfs which save the police know it also and it is in paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere they sought the ex mayor of m sur m javert was summoned to paris to throw light on their researches javert had in fact rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of jean valjean javert's zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by m chabouillet secretary of the prefecture under comte angles m chabouillet who had moreover already been,LM
1857,javert's patron had the inspector of m sur m attached to the police force of paris there javert rendered himself useful in divers and though the word may seem strange for such services honorable manners he no longer thought of jean valjean the wolf of to day causes these dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday when in december he read a newspaper he who never read newspapers but javert a monarchical man had a desire to know the particulars of the triumphal entry of the prince generalissimo into bayonne just as he was finishing the article which interested him a name the name of jean valjean attracted his attention at the bottom of a page the paper announced that the convict jean valjean was dead and published the fact in such formal terms that javert did not doubt it he confined himself to the remark that's a good entry then he threw aside the paper and thought no more about it some time afterwards it chanced that a police report was transmitted from the prefecture of the seine et oise to the prefecture of police in paris concerning the abduction of a child,LM
1858,which had taken place under peculiar circumstances as it was said in the commune of montfermeil a little girl of seven or eight years of age the report said who had been intrusted by her mother to an inn keeper of that neighborhood had been stolen by a stranger this child answered to the name of cosette and was the daughter of a girl named fantine who had died in the hospital it was not known where or when this report came under javert's eye and set him to thinking the name of fantine was well known to him he remembered that jean valjean had made him javert burst into laughter by asking him for a respite of three days for the purpose of going to fetch that creature's child he recalled the fact that jean valjean had been arrested in paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for montfermeil some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach and that he had already on the previous day made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village for he had not been seen in,LM
1859,the village itself what had he been intending to do in that region of montfermeil it could not even be surmised javert understood it now fantine's daughter was there jean valjean was going there in search of her and now this child had been stolen by a stranger who could that stranger be could it be jean valjean but jean valjean was dead javert without saying anything to anybody took the coach from the pewter platter cul de sac de la planchette and made a trip to montfermeil he expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there he found a great deal of obscurity for the first few days the thenardiers had chattered in their rage the disappearance of the lark had created a sensation in the village he immediately obtained numerous versions of the story which ended in the abduction of a child hence the police report but their first vexation having passed off thenardier with his wonderful instinct had very quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the prosecutor of the crown and that his complaints with regard to the abduction of cosette would have as their first result to fix,LM
1860,upon himself and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand the glittering eye of justice the last thing that owls desire is to have a candle brought to them and in the first place how explain the fifteen hundred francs which he had received he turned squarely round put a gag on his wife's mouth and feigned astonishment when the stolen child was mentioned to him he understood nothing about it no doubt he had grumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature taken from him so hastily he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer out of tenderness but her grandfather had come for her in the most natural way in the world he added the grandfather which produced a good effect this was the story that javert hit upon when he arrived at montfermeil the grandfather caused jean valjean to vanish nevertheless javert dropped a few questions like plummets into thenardier's history who was that grandfather and what was his name thenardier replied with simplicity he is a wealthy farmer i saw his passport i think his name was m guillaume lambert lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name thereupon,LM
1861,javert returned to paris jean valjean is certainly dead said he and i am a ninny he had again begun to forget this history when in the course of march he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of saint medard and who had been surnamed the mendicant who gives alms this person the story ran was a man of means whose name no one knew exactly and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years who knew nothing about herself save that she had come from montfermeil montfermeil that name was always coming up and it made javert prick up his ears an old beggar police spy an ex beadle to whom this person had given alms added a few more details this gentleman of property was very shy never coming out except in the evening speaking to no one except occasionally to the poor and never allowing any one to approach him he wore a horrible old yellow frock coat which was worth many millions being all wadded with bank bills this piqued javert's curiosity in a decided manner in order to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarming him,LM
1862,he borrowed the beadle's outfit for a day and the place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching every evening whining orisons through his nose and playing the spy under cover of prayer the suspected individual did indeed approach javert thus disguised and bestow alms on him at that moment javert raised his head and the shock which jean valjean received on recognizing javert was equal to the one received by javert when he thought he recognized jean valjean however the darkness might have misled him jean valjean's death was official javert cherished very grave doubts and when in doubt javert the man of scruples never laid a finger on any one's collar he followed his man to the gorbeau house and got the old woman to talking which was no difficult matter the old woman confirmed the fact regarding the coat lined with millions and narrated to him the episode of the thousand franc bill she had seen it she had handled it javert hired a room that evening he installed himself in it he came and listened at the mysterious lodger's door hoping to catch the sound of his voice but jean valjean saw his,LM
1863,candle through the key hole and foiled the spy by keeping silent on the following day jean valjean decamped but the noise made by the fall of the five franc piece was noticed by the old woman who hearing the rattling of coin suspected that he might be intending to leave and made haste to warn javert at night when jean valjean came out javert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men javert had demanded assistance at the prefecture but he had not mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize that was his secret and he had kept it for three reasons in the first place because the slightest indiscretion might put jean valjean on the alert next because to lay hands on an ex convict who had made his escape and was reputed dead on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed forever as among malefactors of the most dangerous sort was a magnificent success which the old members of the parisian police would assuredly not leave to a new comer like javert and he was afraid of being deprived of his convict and lastly because javert being an,LM

1875,with green flowers at fifteen sous the roll a white dull light fell from a large window with tiny panes on the left which usurped the whole width of the room one gazed about but saw no one one listened one heard neither a footstep nor a human murmur the walls were bare the chamber was not furnished there was not even a chair one looked again and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular hole about a foot square with a grating of interlacing iron bars black knotted solid which formed squares i had almost said meshes of less than an inch and a half in diagonal length the little green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square hole this grating would have prevented it it did not allow the passage of the body but it did allow the passage of the eyes that is to say of the mind this seems to have occurred to,LM

1877,the same impression as when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire before the grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted one was in fact in a sort of theatre box narrow furnished with two old chairs and a much frayed straw matting sparely illuminated by the vague light from the glass door a regular box with its front just of a height to lean upon bearing a tablet of black wood this box was grated only the grating of it was not of gilded wood as at the opera it was a monstrous lattice of iron bars hideously interlaced and riveted to the wall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists the first minutes passed when one's eyes began to grow used to this cellar like half twilight one tried to pass the grating but got no further than six inches beyond it there he encountered a barrier of black shutters re enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood painted a gingerbread yellow these shutters were divided into long narrow slats and they masked the entire length of the grating they were always closed at the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice,LM
1878,proceeding from behind these shutters and saying i am here what do you wish with me it was a beloved sometimes an adored voice no one was visible hardly the sound of a breath was audible it seemed as though it were a spirit which had been evoked that was speaking to you across the walls of the tomb if one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you the evoked spirit became an apparition behind the grating behind the shutter one perceived so far as the grating permitted sight a head of which only the mouth and the chin were visible the rest was covered with a black veil one caught a glimpse of a black guimpe and a form that was barely defined covered with a black shroud that head spoke with you but did not look at you and never smiled at you the light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that you saw her in the white and she saw you in the black this light was symbolical nevertheless your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was made,LM
1879,in that place shut off from all glances a profound vagueness enveloped that form clad in mourning your eyes searched that vagueness and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition at the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could see nothing what you beheld was night emptiness shadows a wintry mist mingled with a vapor from the tomb a sort of terrible peace a silence from which you could gather nothing not even sighs a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing not even phantoms what you beheld was the interior of a cloister it was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called the convent of the bernardines of the perpetual adoration the box in which you stood was the parlor the first voice which had addressed you was that of the portress who always sat motionless and silent on the other side of the wall near the square opening screened by the iron grating and the plate with its thousand holes as by a double visor the obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the parlor which had a window on the side of the,LM
1880,world had none on the side of the convent profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place nevertheless there was something beyond that shadow there was a light there was life in the midst of that death although this was the most strictly walled of all convents we shall endeavor to make our way into it and to take the reader in and to say without transgressing the proper bounds things which story tellers have never seen and have therefore never described ii the obedience of martin verga this convent which in had already existed for many a long year in the rue petit picpus was a community of bernardines of the obedience of martin verga these bernardines were attached in consequence not to clairvaux like the bernardine monks but to citeaux like the benedictine monks in other words they were the subjects not of saint bernard but of saint benoit any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that martin verga founded in a congregation of bernardines benedictines with salamanca for the head of the order and alcala as the branch establishment this congregation had sent out branches throughout all the catholic countries of,LM
1881,europe there is nothing unusual in the latin church in these grafts of one order on another to mention only a single order of saint benoit which is here in question there are attached to this order without counting the obedience of martin verga four congregations two in italy mont cassin and sainte justine of padua two in france cluny and saint maur and nine orders vallombrosa granmont the celestins the camaldules the carthusians the humilies the olivateurs the silvestrins and lastly citeaux for citeaux itself a trunk for other orders is only an offshoot of saint benoit citeaux dates from saint robert abbe de molesme in the diocese of langres in now it was in that the devil having retired to the desert of subiaco he was old had he turned hermit was chased from the ancient temple of apollo where he dwelt by saint benoit then aged seventeen after the rule of the carmelites who go barefoot wear a bit of willow on their throats and never sit down the harshest rule is that of the bernardines benedictines of martin verga they are clothed in black with a guimpe which in accordance with the express command of saint,LM

1883,sacrament about three inches long in silver gilt or gilded copper the nuns of the petit picpus did not wear this holy sacrament the perpetual adoration which was common to the house of the petit picpus and to the house of the temple leaves those two orders perfectly distinct their only resemblance lies in this practice of the ladies of the holy sacrament and the bernardines of martin verga just as there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of all the mysteries relating to the infancy the life and death of jesus christ and the virgin between the two orders which were nevertheless widely separated and on occasion even hostile the oratory of italy established at florence by philip de neri and the oratory of france established by pierre de berulle the oratory of france claimed the precedence since philip de neri was only a saint while berulle was a cardinal let us return to the harsh spanish rule of martin verga the bernardines benedictines of this obedience fast all the year round abstain from meat fast in lent and on many other days which are peculiar to them rise from their first sleep from one to,LM

1887,the whole soul is absorbed the sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall directly behind her besides this there is always a sister kneeling before the holy sacrament this station lasts an hour they relieve each other like soldiers on guard this is the perpetual adoration the prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped with peculiar solemnity recalling not the saints and martyrs but moments in the life of jesus christ as mother nativity mother conception mother presentation mother passion but the names of saints are not interdicted when one sees them one never sees anything but their mouths all their teeth are yellow no tooth brush ever entered that convent brushing one's teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the loss of one's soul they never say my they possess nothing of their own and they must not attach themselves to anything they call everything our thus our veil our chaplet if they were speaking of their chemise they would say our chemise sometimes they grow attached to some petty object to a book of hours a relic a medal that has been blessed as soon,LM

1889,it is their way of saying good day which is in fact full of grace at each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the church bell of the convent at this signal prioress vocal mothers professed nuns lay sisters novices postulants interrupt what they are saying what they are doing or what they are thinking and all say in unison if it is five o'clock for instance at five o'clock and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar if it is eight o'clock at eight o'clock and at all hours and so on according to the hour this custom the object of which is to break the thread of thought and to lead it back constantly to god exists in many communities the formula alone varies thus at the infant jesus they say at this hour and at every hour may the love of jesus kindle my heart the bernardines benedictines of martin verga cloistered fifty years ago at petit picpus chant the offices to a solemn psalmody a pure gregorian chant and always with full voice during the whole course of the office everywhere in the missal where an,LM
1890,asterisk occurs they pause and say in a low voice jesus marie joseph for the office of the dead they adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a depth the effect produced is striking and tragic the nuns of the petit picpus had made a vault under their grand altar for the burial of their community the government as they say does not permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when they die this is an affliction to them and causes them consternation as an infraction of the rules they had obtained a mediocre consolation at best permission to be interred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient vaugirard cemetery which was made of land which had formerly belonged to their community on fridays the nuns hear high mass vespers and all the offices as on sunday they scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals unknown to people of the world of which the church of france was so prodigal in the olden days and of which it is still prodigal in spain and italy their stations in the chapel are interminable,LM
1891,as for the number and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of them than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them the prayers of the postulants are frightful the prayers of the novices are still worse and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse once a week the chapter assembles the prioress presides the vocal mothers assist each sister kneels in turn on the stones and confesses aloud in the presence of all the faults and sins which she has committed during the week the vocal mothers consult after each confession and inflict the penance aloud besides this confession in a loud tone for which all faults in the least serious are reserved they have for their venial offences what they call the coulpe to make one's coulpe means to prostrate one's self flat on one's face during the office in front of the prioress until the latter who is never called anything but our mother notifies the culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall that she can rise the coulpe or peccavi is made for a very small matter a broken glass a torn,LM
1892,veil an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an office a false note in church etc this suffices and the coulpe is made the coulpe is entirely spontaneous it is the culpable person herself the word is etymologically in its place here who judges herself and inflicts it on herself on festival days and sundays four mother precentors intone the offices before a large reading desk with four places one day one of the mother precentors intoned a psalm beginning with ecce and instead of ecce she uttered aloud the three notes do si sol for this piece of absent mindedness she underwent a coulpe which lasted during the whole service what rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed when a nun is summoned to the parlor even were it the prioress herself she drops her veil as will be remembered so that only her mouth is visible the prioress alone can hold communication with strangers the others can see only their immediate family and that very rarely if by chance an outsider presents herself to see a nun or one whom she has known and loved in the outer world a regular series,LM
1893,of negotiations is required if it is a woman the authorization may sometimes be granted the nun comes and they talk to her through the shutters which are opened only for a mother or sister it is unnecessary to say that permission is always refused to men such is the rule of saint benoit aggravated by martin verga these nuns are not gay rosy and fresh as the daughters of other orders often are they are pale and grave between and three of them went mad iii austerities one is a postulant for two years at least often for four a novice for four it is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced earlier than the age of twenty three or twenty four years the bernardines benedictines of martin verga do not admit widows to their order in their cells they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations of which they must never speak on the day when a novice makes her profession she is dressed in her handsomest attire she is crowned with white roses her hair is brushed until it shines and curled then she prostrates herself a great black veil is thrown over her and the,LM

1895,in the early days the nuns were in the habit of lending them their black garments this seemed profane and the prioress forbade it only the novices were permitted to lend it is remarkable that these performances tolerated and encouraged no doubt in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit were a genuine happiness and a real recreation for the scholars they simply amused themselves with it it was new it gave them a change candid reasons of childhood which do not however succeed in making us worldlings comprehend the felicity of holding a holy water sprinkler in one's hand and standing for hours together singing hard enough for four in front of a reading desk the pupils conformed with the exception of the austerities to all the practices of the convent there was a certain young woman who entered the world and who after many years of married life had not succeeded in breaking herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever any one knocked at her door forever like the nuns the pupils saw their relatives only in the parlor their,LM

1900,country there was a great deal of forest and the wolf was in the forest and he ate the little cocks and this other poem there came a blow with a stick it was punchinello who bestowed it on the cat it was not good for her it hurt her then a lady put punchinello in prison it was there that a little abandoned child a foundling whom the convent was bringing up out of charity uttered this sweet and heart breaking saying she heard the others talking of their mothers and she murmured in her corner as for me my mother was not there when i was born there was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through the corridors with her bunch of keys and whose name was sister agatha the big big girls those over ten years of age called her agathocles the refectory a large apartment of an oblong square form which received no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the garden was dark and damp and as the children say full of beasts all the places round about furnished their contingent of insects each of its four corners had,LM
1901,received in the language of the pupils a special and expressive name there was spider corner caterpillar corner wood louse corner and cricket corner cricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed it was not so cold there as elsewhere from the refectory the names had passed to the boarding school and there served as in the old college mazarin to distinguish four nations every pupil belonged to one of these four nations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat at meals one day monseigneur the archbishop while making his pastoral visit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter the class room through which he was passing he inquired of another pupil a charming brunette with rosy cheeks who stood near him who is that she is a spider monseigneur bah and that one yonder she is a cricket and that one she is a caterpillar really and yourself i am a wood louse monseigneur every house of this sort has its own peculiarities at the beginning of this century ecouen was one of those strict and graceful places where young girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is,LM
1902,almost august at ecouen in order to take rank in the procession of the holy sacrament a distinction was made between virgins and florists there were also the dais and the censors the first who held the cords of the dais and the others who carried incense before the holy sacrament the flowers belonged by right to the florists four virgins walked in advance on the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the question put in the dormitory who is a virgin madame campan used to quote this saying of a little one of seven years to a big girl of sixteen who took the head of the procession while she the little one remained at the rear you are a virgin but i am not v distractions above the door of the refectory this prayer which was called the white paternoster and which possessed the property of bearing people straight to paradise was inscribed in large black letters little white paternoster which god made which god said which god placed in paradise in the evening when i went to bed i found three angels sitting on my bed one at the foot two,LM
1903,at the head the good virgin mary in the middle who told me to lie down without hesitation the good god is my father the good virgin is my mother the three apostles are my brothers the three virgins are my sisters the shirt in which god was born envelopes my body saint margaret's cross is written on my breast madame the virgin was walking through the meadows weeping for god when she met m saint john monsieur saint john whence come you i come from ave salus you have not seen the good god where is he he is on the tree of the cross his feet hanging his hands nailed a little cap of white thorns on his head whoever shall say this thrice at eventide thrice in the morning shall win paradise at the last in this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall under a triple coating of daubing paint at the present time it is finally disappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then and who are old women now a large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this refectory whose only door as we think we have mentioned,LM
1904,opened on the garden two narrow tables each flanked by two wooden benches formed two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory the walls were white the tables were black these two mourning colors constitute the only variety in convents the meals were plain and the food of the children themselves severe a single dish of meat and vegetables combined or salt fish such was their luxury this meagre fare which was reserved for the pupils alone was nevertheless an exception the children ate in silence under the eye of the mother whose turn it was who if a fly took a notion to fly or to hum against the rule opened and shut a wooden book from time to time this silence was seasoned with the lives of the saints read aloud from a little pulpit with a desk which was situated at the foot of the crucifix the reader was one of the big girls in weekly turn at regular distances on the bare tables there were large varnished bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks and into which they sometimes threw some scrap of tough,LM
1905,meat or spoiled fish this was punished these bowls were called ronds d'eau the child who broke the silence made a cross with her tongue where on the ground she licked the pavement the dust that end of all joys was charged with the chastisement of those poor little rose leaves which had been guilty of chirping there was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as a unique copy and which it is forbidden to read it is the rule of saint benoit an arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate nemo regulas seu constitutiones nostras externis communicabit the pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book and set to reading it with avidity a reading which was often interrupted by the fear of being caught which caused them to close the volume precipitately from the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderate amount of pleasure the most interesting thing they found were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys they played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby fruit trees in spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments administered,LM
1906,when the wind had shaken the trees they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or an inhabited pear on the sly i will now cede the privilege of speech to a letter which lies before me a letter written five and twenty years ago by an old pupil now madame la duchesse de one of the most elegant women in paris i quote literally one hides one's pear or one's apple as best one may when one goes up stairs to put the veil on the bed before supper one stuffs them under one's pillow and at night one eats them in bed and when one cannot do that one eats them in the closet that was one of their greatest luxuries once it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the convent one of the young girls mademoiselle bouchard who was connected with the montmorency family laid a wager that she would ask for a day's leave of absence an enormity in so austere a community the wager was accepted but not one of those who bet believed that she would do it when the moment came as the,LM
1907,archbishop was passing in front of the pupils mademoiselle bouchard to the indescribable terror of her companions stepped out of the ranks and said monseigneur a day's leave of absence mademoiselle bouchard was tall blooming with the prettiest little rosy face in the world m de quelen smiled and said what my dear child a day's leave of absence three days if you like i grant you three days the prioress could do nothing the archbishop had spoken horror of the convent but joy of the pupil the effect may be imagined this stern cloister was not so well walled off however but that the life of the passions of the outside world drama and even romance did not make their way in to prove this we will confine ourselves to recording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact which however bears no reference in itself to and is not connected by any thread whatever with the story which we are relating we mention the fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the reader's mind about this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was not a nun who,LM
1908,was treated with great respect and who was addressed as madame albertine nothing was known about her save that she was mad and that in the world she passed for dead beneath this history it was said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great marriage this woman hardly thirty years of age of dark complexion and tolerably pretty had a vague look in her large black eyes could she see there was some doubt about this she glided rather than walked she never spoke it was not quite known whether she breathed her nostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh to touch her hand was like touching snow she possessed a strange spectral grace wherever she entered people felt cold one day a sister on seeing her pass said to another sister she passes for a dead woman perhaps she is one replied the other a hundred tales were told of madame albertine this arose from the eternal curiosity of the pupils in the chapel there was a gallery called l'oeil de boeuf it was in this gallery which had only a circular bay an oeil de boeuf that madame albertine listened,LM
1909,to the offices she always occupied it alone because from this gallery being on the level of the first story the preacher or the officiating priest could be seen which was interdicted to the nuns one day the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank m le duc de rohan peer of france officer of the red musketeers in when he was prince de leon and who died afterward in as cardinal and archbishop of besancon it was the first time that m de rohan had preached at the petit picpus convent madame albertine usually preserved perfect calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services that day as soon as she caught sight of m de rohan she half rose and said in a loud voice amid the silence of the chapel ah auguste the whole community turned their heads in amazement the preacher raised his eyes but madame albertine had relapsed into her immobility a breath from the outer world a flash of life had passed for an instant across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished and the mad woman had become a corpse again those two words however had set every,LM
1910,one in the convent who had the privilege of speech to chattering how many things were contained in that ah auguste what revelations m de rohan's name really was auguste it was evident that madame albertine belonged to the very highest society since she knew m de rohan and that her own rank there was of the highest since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a lord and that there existed between them some connection of relationship perhaps but a very close one in any case since she knew his pet name two very severe duchesses mesdames de choiseul and de serent often visited the community whither they penetrated no doubt in virtue of the privilege magnates mulieres and caused great consternation in the boarding school when these two old ladies passed by all the poor young girls trembled and dropped their eyes moreover m de rohan quite unknown to himself was an object of attention to the school girls at that epoch he had just been made while waiting for the episcopate vicar general of the archbishop of paris it was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate the offices in the chapel of the,LM
1911,nuns of the petit picpus not one of the young recluses could see him because of the serge curtain but he had a sweet and rather shrill voice which they had come to know and to distinguish he had been a mousquetaire and then he was said to be very coquettish that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent moire and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world he held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years not a sound from without made its way into the convent but there was one year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither this was an event and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall it it was a flute which was played in the neighborhood this flute always played the same air an air which is very far away nowadays my zetulbe come reign o'er my soul and it was heard two or three times a day the young girls passed hours in listening to it the vocal mothers were upset,LM
1912,by it brains were busy punishments descended in showers this lasted for several months the girls were all more or less in love with the unknown musician each one dreamed that she was zetulbe the sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the rue droit mur and they would have given anything compromised everything attempted anything for the sake of seeing of catching a glance if only for a second of the young man who played that flute so deliciously and who no doubt played on all these souls at the same time there were some who made their escape by a back door and ascended to the third story on the rue droit mur side in order to attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps impossible one even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating and to wave her white handkerchief two were still bolder they found means to climb on a roof and risked their lives there and succeeded at last in seeing the young man he was an old emigre gentleman blind and penniless who was playing his flute in his attic in order to pass the time vi the,LM
1913,little convent in this enclosure of the petit picpus there were three perfectly distinct buildings the great convent inhabited by the nuns the boarding school where the scholars were lodged and lastly what was called the little convent it was a building with a garden in which lived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders the relics of cloisters destroyed in the revolution a reunion of all the black gray and white medleys of all communities and all possible varieties what might be called if such a coupling of words is permissible a sort of harlequin convent when the empire was established all these poor old dispersed and exiled women had been accorded permission to come and take shelter under the wings of the bernardines benedictines the government paid them a small pension the ladies of the petit picpus received them cordially it was a singular pell mell each followed her own rule sometimes the pupils of the boarding school were allowed as a great recreation to pay them a visit the result is that all those young memories have retained among other souvenirs that of mother sainte bazile mother sainte scolastique and mother jacob one of these refugees,LM
1914,found herself almost at home she was a nun of sainte aure the only one of her order who had survived the ancient convent of the ladies of sainte aure occupied at the beginning of the eighteenth century this very house of the petit picpus which belonged later to the benedictines of martin verga this holy woman too poor to wear the magnificent habit of her order which was a white robe with a scarlet scapulary had piously put it on a little manikin which she exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at her death in only one nun of this order remained to day there remains only a doll in addition to these worthy mothers some old society women had obtained permission of the prioress like madame albertine to retire into the little convent among the number were madame beaufort d'hautpoul and marquise dufresne another was never known in the convent except by the formidable noise which she made when she blew her nose the pupils called her madame vacarmini hubbub about or madame de genlis who was at that time editing a little periodical publication called l'intrepide asked to be allowed to enter the,LM

1922,from the intersection of the rue polonceau the rue droit mur the rue petit picpus and the unused lane called rue aumarais on old plans these four streets surrounded this trapezium like a moat the convent was composed of several buildings and a garden the principal building taken in its entirety was a juxtaposition of hybrid constructions which viewed from a bird's eye view outlined with considerable exactness a gibbet laid flat on the ground the main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment of the rue droit mur comprised between the rue petit picpus and the rue polonceau the lesser arm was a lofty gray severe grated facade which faced the rue petit picpus the carriage entrance no marked its extremity towards the centre of this facade was a low arched door whitened with dust and ashes where the spiders wove their webs and which was open only for an hour or two on sundays and on rare occasions when the coffin of a nun left the convent this was the public entrance of the church the elbow of the gibbet was a square hall which was used as the servants hall and which the nuns,LM
1923,called the buttery in the main arm were the cells of the mothers the sisters and the novices in the lesser arm lay the kitchens the refectory backed up by the cloisters and the church between the door no and the corner of the closed lane aumarais was the school which was not visible from without the remainder of the trapezium formed the garden which was much lower than the level of the rue polonceau which caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside the garden which was slightly arched had in its centre on the summit of a hillock a fine pointed and conical fir tree whence ran as from the peaked boss of a shield four grand alleys and ranged by twos in between the branchings of these eight small ones so that if the enclosure had been circular the geometrical plan of the alleys would have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel as the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of the garden they were of unequal length they were bordered with currant bushes at the bottom an alley of tall poplars ran from the ruins of,LM
1924,the old convent which was at the angle of the rue droit mur to the house of the little convent which was at the angle of the aumarais lane in front of the little convent was what was called the little garden to this whole let the reader add a courtyard all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings prison walls the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the rue polonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood and he will be able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the bernardines of the petit picpus was forty years ago this holy house had been built on the precise site of a famous tennis ground of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century which was called the tennis ground of the eleven thousand devils all these streets moreover were more ancient than paris these names droit mur and aumarais are very ancient the streets which bear them are very much more ancient still aumarais lane was called maugout lane the rue droit mur was called the rue des eglantiers for god opened flowers before man cut stones ix a century,LM
1925,under a guimpe since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of the petit picpus was in former times and since we have ventured to open a window on that discreet retreat the reader will permit us one other little digression utterly foreign to this book but characteristic and useful since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures in the little convent there was a centenarian who came from the abbey of fontevrault she had even been in society before the revolution she talked a great deal of m de miromesnil keeper of the seals under louis xvi and of a presidentess duplat with whom she had been very intimate it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext she told wonders of the abbey of fontevrault that it was like a city and that there were streets in the monastery she talked with a picard accent which amused the pupils every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint francois gave it to monseigneur saint julien monseigneur saint julien gave it to monseigneur,LM
1926,saint eusebius monseigneur saint eusebius gave it to monseigneur saint procopius etc etc and thus i give it to you father and the school girls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under their veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown on another occasion the centenarian was telling stories she said that in her youth the bernardine monks were every whit as good as the mousquetaires it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century she told about the custom of the four wines which existed before the revolution in champagne and bourgogne when a great personage a marshal of france a prince a duke and a peer traversed a town in burgundy or champagne the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine on the first goblet this inscription could be read monkey wine on the second lion wine on the third sheep wine on the fourth hog wine these four legends express the four stages descended by the drunkard the first intoxication which enlivens the second that which irritates the third,LM
1927,that which dulls and the fourth that which brutalizes in a cupboard under lock and key she kept a mysterious object of which she thought a great deal the rule of fontevrault did not forbid this she would not show this object to anyone she shut herself up which her rule allowed her to do and hid herself every time that she desired to contemplate it if she heard a footstep in the corridor she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands as soon as it was mentioned to her she became silent she who was so fond of talking the most curious were baffled by her silence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent what could that treasure of the centenarian be which was so precious and so secret some holy book no doubt some unique chaplet some authentic relic they lost themselves in conjectures when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it they found the object beneath a triple linen cloth,LM
1928,like some consecrated paten it was a faenza platter representing little loves flitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes the chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures one of the charming little loves is already fairly spitted he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancer is laughing with a satanical air moral love conquered by the colic this platter which is very curious and which had possibly the honor of furnishing moliere with an idea was still in existence in september it was for sale by a bric a brac merchant in the boulevard beaumarchais this good old woman would not receive any visits from outside because said she the parlor is too gloomy x origin of the perpetual adoration however this almost sepulchral parlor of which we have sought to convey an idea is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the same severity in other convents at the convent of the rue du temple in particular which belonged in truth to another order the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains and the parlor itself was a salon with a polished wood floor,LM
1929,whose windows were draped in white muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames a portrait of a benedictine nun with unveiled face painted bouquets and even the head of a turk it is in that garden of the temple convent that stood that famous chestnut tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in france and which bore the reputation among the good people of the eighteenth century of being the father of all the chestnut trees of the realm as we have said this convent of the temple was occupied by benedictines of the perpetual adoration benedictines quite different from those who depended on citeaux this order of the perpetual adoration is not very ancient and does not go back more than two hundred years in the holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart in two churches in paris at saint sulpice and at saint jean en greve a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar m the prior and vicar general of saint germain des pres ordered a solemn procession of all his clergy in which the pope's nuncio officiated but this expiation did,LM
1930,not satisfy two sainted women madame courtin marquise de boucs and the comtesse de chateauvieux this outrage committed on the most holy sacrament of the altar though but temporary would not depart from these holy souls and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a perpetual adoration in some female monastery both of them one in the other in made donations of notable sums to mother catherine de bar called of the holy sacrament a benedictine nun for the purpose of founding to this pious end a monastery of the order of saint benoit the first permission for this foundation was given to mother catherine de bar by m de metz abbe of saint germain on condition that no woman could be received unless she contributed three hundred livres income which amounts to six thousand livres to the principal after the abbe of saint germain the king accorded letters patent and all the rest abbatial charter and royal letters was confirmed in by the chamber of accounts and the parliament such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the benedictines of the perpetual adoration of the holy sacrament at paris their first,LM
1931,convent was a new building in the rue cassette out of the contributions of mesdames de boucs and de chateauvieux this order as it will be seen was not to be confounded with the benedictine nuns of citeaux it mounted back to the abbe of saint germain des pres in the same manner that the ladies of the sacred heart go back to the general of the jesuits and the sisters of charity to the general of the lazarists it was also totally different from the bernardines of the petit picpus whose interior we have just shown in pope alexander vii had authorized by a special brief the bernardines of the rue petit picpus to practise the perpetual adoration like the benedictine nuns of the holy sacrament but the two orders remained distinct none the less xi end of the petit picpus at the beginning of the restoration the convent of the petit picpus was in its decay this forms a part of the general death of the order which after the eighteenth century has been disappearing like all the religious orders contemplation is like prayer one of humanity's needs but like everything which the revolution touched it will be,LM

1968,to my paw as though i were a wild beast jean valjean fell into more and more profound thought this convent would be our salvation he murmured then he raised his voice yes the difficulty is to remain here no said fauchelevent the difficulty is to get out jean valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart to get out yes monsieur madeleine in order to return here it is first necessary to get out and after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded fauchelevent went on you must not be found here in this fashion whence come you for me you fall from heaven because i know you but the nuns require one to enter by the door all at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell ah said fauchelevent they are ringing up the vocal mothers they are going to the chapter they always hold a chapter when any one dies she died at daybreak people generally do die at daybreak but cannot you get out by the way in which you entered come i do not ask for the sake of questioning you but how did you get in jean valjean,LM
1969,turned pale the very thought of descending again into that terrible street made him shudder you make your way out of a forest filled with tigers and once out of it imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to return thither jean valjean pictured to himself the whole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter agents on the watch sentinels everywhere frightful fists extended towards his collar javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps impossible said he father fauchelevent say that i fell from the sky but i believe it i believe it retorted fauchelevent you have no need to tell me that the good god must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of getting a good look at you close to and then dropped you only he meant to place you in a man's convent he made a mistake come there goes another peal that is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the dead doctor is to come here and view a corpse all that is the ceremony of dying these good ladies are not at all fond of that visit a doctor is,LM
1970,a man who does not believe in anything he lifts the veil sometimes he lifts something else too how quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time what is the matter your little one is still asleep what is her name cosette she is your daughter you are her grandfather that is yes it will be easy enough for her to get out of here i have my service door which opens on the courtyard i knock the porter opens i have my vintage basket on my back the child is in it i go out father fauchelevent goes out with his basket that is perfectly natural you will tell the child to keep very quiet she will be under the cover i will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend a fruit seller whom i know in the rue chemin vert who is deaf and who has a little bed i will shout in the fruit seller's ear that she is a niece of mine and that she is to keep her for me until to morrow then the little one will re enter with you for i will contrive to have you,LM
1971,re enter it must be done but how will you manage to get out jean valjean shook his head no one must see me the whole point lies there father fauchelevent find some means of getting me out in a basket under cover like cosette fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his left hand a sign of serious embarrassment a third peal created a diversion that is the dead doctor taking his departure said fauchelevent he has taken a look and said she is dead that is well when the doctor has signed the passport for paradise the undertaker's company sends a coffin if it is a mother the mothers lay her out if she is a sister the sisters lay her out after which i nail her up that forms a part of my gardener's duty a gardener is a bit of a grave digger she is placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead i don't count the undertaker's men and myself as men it is in that hall that i nail up the,LM
1972,coffin the undertaker's men come and get it and whip up coachman that's the way one goes to heaven they fetch a box with nothing in it they take it away again with something in it that's what a burial is like de profundis a horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping cosette who lay with her mouth vaguely open and had the air of an angel drinking in the light jean valjean had fallen to gazing at her he was no longer listening to fauchelevent that one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence the good old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble the grave is dug in the vaugirard cemetery they declare that they are going to suppress that vaugirard cemetery it is an ancient cemetery which is outside the regulations which has no uniform and which is going to retire it is a shame for it is convenient i have a friend there father mestienne the grave digger the nuns here possess one privilege it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall there is a special permission from the prefecture on their behalf but how many events,LM
1973,have happened since yesterday mother crucifixion is dead and father madeleine is buried said jean valjean smiling sadly fauchelevent caught the word goodness if you were here for good it would be a real burial a fourth peal burst out fauchelevent hastily detached the belled knee cap from its nail and buckled it on his knee again this time it is for me the mother prioress wants me good now i am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle monsieur madeleine don't stir from here and wait for me something new has come up if you are hungry there is wine bread and cheese and he hastened out of the hut crying coming coming jean valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his crooked leg would permit casting a sidelong glance by the way on his melon patch less than ten minutes later father fauchelevent whose bell put the nuns in his road to flight tapped gently at a door and a gentle voice replied forever forever that is to say enter the door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the gardener on business this parlor adjoined the chapter hall the prioress,LM
1974,seated on the only chair in the parlor was waiting for fauchelevent ii fauchelevent in the presence of a difficulty it is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions notably priests and nuns to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions at the moment when fauchelevent entered this double form of preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress who was that wise and charming mademoiselle de blemeur mother innocente who was ordinarily cheerful the gardener made a timid bow and remained at the door of the cell the prioress who was telling her beads raised her eyes and said ah it is you father fauvent this abbreviation had been adopted in the convent fauchelevent bowed again father fauvent i have sent for you here i am reverend mother i have something to say to you and so have i said fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him inward terror i have something to say to the very reverend mother the prioress stared at him ah you have a communication to make to me a request very well speak goodman fauchelevent the ex notary belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance a certain clever,LM
1975,ignorance constitutes a force you do not distrust it and you are caught by it fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent always solitary and busied about his gardening he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity as he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro he saw before him only an agitation of shadows by dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh and those corpses were alive for him he was like a deaf man whose sight grows keener and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute he had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals and he had succeeded so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear fauchelevent knew all and concealed all that constituted his art the whole convent thought him stupid a great merit in religion the vocal mothers made much of fauchelevent he was a curious mute he inspired confidence moreover he was regular and never went,LM
1976,out except for well demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden this discretion of conduct had inured to his credit none the less he had set two men to chattering the porter in the convent and he knew the singularities of their parlor and the grave digger at the cemetery and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture in this way he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns one as to their life the other as to their death but he did not abuse his knowledge the congregation thought a great deal of him old lame blind to everything probably a little deaf into the bargain what qualities they would have found it difficult to replace him the goodman with the assurance of a person who feels that he is appreciated entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prioress he talked a long time about his age his infirmities the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth of the increasing demands of his work of the great size of the garden of nights which must be passed like the last for instance when he had been,LM
1977,obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds because of the moon and he wound up as follows that he had a brother the prioress made a movement a brother no longer young a second movement on the part of the prioress but one expressive of reassurance that if he might be permitted this brother would come and live with him and help him that he was an excellent gardener that the community would receive from him good service better than his own that otherwise if his brother were not admitted as he the elder felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the work he should be obliged greatly to his regret to go away and that his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him who might be reared for god in the house and who might who knows become a nun some day when he had finished speaking the prioress stayed the slipping of her rosary between her fingers and said to him could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening for what purpose to serve as a lever yes reverend mother replied fauchelevent the,LM
1978,prioress without adding a word rose and entered the adjoining room which was the hall of the chapter and where the vocal mothers were probably assembled fauchelevent was left alone iii mother innocente about a quarter of an hour elapsed the prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair the two interlocutors seemed preoccupied we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability father fauvent reverend mother do you know the chapel i have a little cage there where i hear the mass and the offices and you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties two or three times there is a stone to be raised heavy the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar the slab which closes the vault yes it would be a good thing to have two men for it mother ascension who is as strong as a man will help you a woman is never a man we have only a woman here to help you each one does what he can because dom mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard while merlonus,LM
1979,horstius only gives three hundred and sixty seven i do not despise merlonus horstius neither do i merit consists in working according to one's strength a cloister is not a dock yard and a woman is not a man but my brother is the strong one though and can you get a lever that is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door there is a ring in the stone i will put the lever through it and the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot that is good reverend mother i will open the vault and the four mother precentors will help you and when the vault is open it must be closed again will that be all no give me your orders very reverend mother fauvent we have confidence in you i am here to do anything you wish and to hold your peace about everything yes reverend mother when the vault is open i will close it again but before that what reverend mother something must be lowered into it a silence ensued the prioress after a pout of the under lip which resembled hesitation broke it father fauvent reverend mother,LM
1980,you know that a mother died this morning no did you not hear the bell nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden really i can hardly distinguish my own signal she died at daybreak and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning it was mother crucifixion a blessed woman the prioress paused moved her lips as though in mental prayer and resumed three years ago madame de bethune a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen mother crucifixion at prayer ah yes now i hear the knell reverend mother the mothers have taken her to the dead room which opens on the church i know no other man than you can or must enter that chamber see to that a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the dead room more often hey more often what do you say i say more often more often than what reverend mother i did not say more often than what i said more often i don't understand you why do you say more often in order to speak like you reverend mother but i did not say more often at that moment nine,LM
1981,o'clock struck at nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the prioress amen said fauchelevent the clock struck opportunely it cut more often short it is probable that had it not been for this the prioress and fauchelevent would never have unravelled that skein fauchelevent mopped his forehead the prioress indulged in another little inward murmur probably sacred then raised her voice in her lifetime mother crucifixion made converts after her death she will perform miracles she will replied father fauchelevent falling into step and striving not to flinch again father fauvent the community has been blessed in mother crucifixion no doubt it is not granted to every one to die like cardinal de berulle while saying the holy mass and to breathe forth their souls to god while pronouncing these words hanc igitur oblationem but without attaining to such happiness mother crucifixion's death was very precious she retained her consciousness to the very last moment she spoke to us then she spoke to the angels she gave us her last commands if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in,LM
1982,her cell she would have cured your leg merely by touching it she smiled we felt that she was regaining her life in god there was something of paradise in that death fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing amen said he father fauvent what the dead wish must be done the prioress took off several beads of her chaplet fauchelevent held his peace she went on i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit reverend mother you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden besides she is more than a dead woman she is a saint like yourself reverend mother she slept in her coffin for twenty years by express permission of our holy father pius vii the one who crowned the emp buonaparte for a clever man like fauchelevent this allusion was an awkward one fortunately the prioress completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it she continued father fauvent reverend mother saint didorus archbishop of cappadocia desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb acarus,LM
1983,which signifies a worm of the earth this was done is this true yes reverend mother the blessed mezzocane abbot of aquila wished to be buried beneath the gallows this was done that is true saint terentius bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides in the hope that passers by would spit on his tomb this was done the dead must be obeyed so be it the body of bernard guidonis born in france near roche abeille was as he had ordered and in spite of the king of castile borne to the church of the dominicans in limoges although bernard guidonis was bishop of tuy in spain can the contrary be affirmed for that matter no reverend mother the fact is attested by plantavit de la fosse several beads of the chaplet were told off still in silence the prioress resumed father fauvent mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years that is just it is a continuation of her slumber so i shall have,LM
1984,to nail up that coffin yes and we are to reject the undertaker's coffin precisely i am at the orders of the very reverend community the four mother precentors will assist you in nailing up the coffin i do not need them no in lowering the coffin where into the vault what vault under the altar fauchelevent started the vault under the altar under the altar but you will have an iron bar yes but you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring but the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion she asked it of us that is to say commanded us but it is forbidden forbidden by men enjoined by god what if it became known we have confidence in you oh i am a stone in your walls the chapter assembled the vocal mothers whom i have just consulted again and who are now deliberating have decided that mother crucifixion shall be buried according to her wish in her,LM
1985,own coffin under our altar think father fauvent if she were to work miracles here what a glory of god for the community and miracles issue from tombs but reverend mother if the agent of the sanitary commission saint benoit ii in the matter of sepulture resisted constantine pogonatus but the commissary of police chonodemaire one of the seven german kings who entered among the gauls under the empire of constantius expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the altar but the inspector from the prefecture the world is nothing in the presence of the cross martin the eleventh general of the carthusians gave to his order this device stat crux dum volvitur orbis amen said fauchelevent who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma whenever he heard latin any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long on the day when the rhetorician gymnastoras left his prison bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in he halted in front of the first tree which he came to harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it the prioress,LM

1988,those in error deny it we live in times of terrible confusion we do not know that which it is necessary to know and we know that which we should ignore we are ignorant and impious in this age there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great saint bernard and the saint bernard denominated of the poor catholics a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of louis xvi to the cross of jesus christ louis xvi was merely a king let us beware of god there is no longer just nor unjust the name of voltaire is known but not the name of cesar de bus nevertheless cesar de bus is a man of blessed memory and voltaire one of unblessed memory the last arch bishop the cardinal de perigord did not even know that charles de gondren succeeded to berulle and francois bourgoin to gondren and jean francois senault to bourgoin and father sainte marthe to jean francois senault the name of father coton is known not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the oratorie but because he,LM
1989,furnished henri iv the huguenot king with the material for an oath that which pleases people of the world in saint francois de sales is that he cheated at play and then religion is attacked why because there have been bad priests because sagittaire bishop of gap was the brother of salone bishop of embrun and because both of them followed mommol what has that to do with the question does that prevent martin de tours from being a saint and giving half of his cloak to a beggar they persecute the saints they shut their eyes to the truth darkness is the rule the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind no one thinks of hell as a reality oh how wicked people are by order of the king signifies to day by order of the revolution one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy death is prohibited burial is a civil matter this is horrible saint leo ii wrote two special letters one to pierre notaire the other to the king of the visigoths for the purpose of combating and rejecting in questions touching the dead the authority of,LM

1994,of the cross and looked fixedly at the gardener the vil stuck fast in his throat he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother that will produce the effect of a corpse you are right earth that is the same thing as man so you will manage the empty coffin i will make that my special business the prioress's face up to that moment troubled and clouded grew serene once more she made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him fauchelevent went towards the door as he was on the point of passing out the prioress raised her voice gently i am pleased with you father fauvent bring your brother to me to morrow after the burial and tell him to fetch his daughter iv in which jean valjean has quite the air of having read austin castillejo the strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly moreover fauchelevent was in a dilemma he took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the,LM
1995,garden cosette had waked up jean valjean had placed her near the fire at the moment when fauchelevent entered jean valjean was pointing out to her the vintner's basket on the wall and saying to her listen attentively to me my little cosette we must go away from this house but we shall return to it and we shall be very happy here the good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch you obey and say nothing above all things unless you want madame thenardier to get you again cosette nodded gravely jean valjean turned round at the noise made by fauchelevent opening the door well everything is arranged and nothing is said fauchelevent i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out that's where the difficulty lies it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out and she will hold her tongue i answer for that but you father madeleine and after a silence fraught with anxiety fauchelevent exclaimed why get out as you came in,LM
1996,jean valjean as in the first instance contented himself with saying impossible fauchelevent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean there is another thing which bothers me i have said that i would put earth in it when i come to think it over the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing it won't do it will get displaced it will move about the men will bear it you understand father madeleine the government will notice it jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving fauchelevent went on how the de uce are you going to get out it must all be done by to morrow morning it is to morrow that i am to bring you in the prioress expects you then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community that it fell among his duties to take part in their burials that he nailed up the coffins and helped the grave digger at the cemetery that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which,LM
1997,had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel that the police regulations forbade this but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased that it was so much the worse for the government that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raise the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vault and that by way of thanks the prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener and his niece as a pupil that his brother was m madeleine and that his niece was cosette that the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery but that he could not bring m madeleine in from the outside if m madeleine was not outside that that was the first problem and then that there was another the empty coffin what is that empty coffin asked jean valjean fauchelevent replied the coffin of the administration what coffin what administration a nun dies the,LM
1998,municipal doctor comes and says a nun has died the government sends a coffin the next day it sends a hearse and undertaker's men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery the undertaker's men will come and lift the coffin there will be nothing in it put something in it a corpse i have none no what then a living person what person me said jean valjean fauchelevent who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair you why not jean valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his face like a flash from heaven in the winter you know fauchelevent what you have said mother crucifixion is dead and i add and father madeleine is buried ah good you can laugh you are not speaking seriously very seriously i must get out of this place certainly l have told you to find a basket and a cover for me also well the basket will be of pine and the cover a black cloth in the first place it will be a white cloth nuns are buried in white let it be a white cloth then you,LM

2034,the prioress in a low voice he answers well jean valjean had not uttered a single word the prioress looked attentively at cosette and said half aloud to the vocal mother she will grow up ugly the two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor then the prioress turned round and said father fauvent you will get another knee cap with a bell two will be required now on the following day therefore two bells were audible in the garden and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their veils at the extreme end of the garden under the trees two men fauvent and another man were visible as they dug side by side an enormous event their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other he is an assistant gardener the vocal mothers added he is a brother of father fauvent jean valjean was in fact regularly installed he had his belled knee cap henceforth he was official his name was ultime fauchelevent the most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the prioress's observation upon cosette she will grow up,LM
2035,ugly the prioress that pronounced prognosticator immediately took a fancy to cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil there is nothing that is not strictly logical about this it is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent women are conscious of their faces now girls who are conscious of their beauty do not easily become nuns the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their good looks more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty hence a lively taste for plain girls the whole of this adventure increased the importance of good old fauchelevent he won a triple success in the eyes of jean valjean whom he had saved and sheltered in those of grave digger gribier who said to himself he spared me that fine with the convent which being enabled thanks to him to retain the coffin of mother crucifixion under the altar eluded caesar and satisfied god there was a coffin containing a body in the petit picpus and a coffin without a body in the vaugirard cemetery public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby but no one was aware of it as,LM
2036,for the convent its gratitude to fauchelevent was very great fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners upon the occasion of the archbishop's next visit the prioress recounted the affair to his grace making something of a confession at the same time and yet boasting of her deed on leaving the convent the archbishop mentioned it with approval and in a whisper to m de latil monsieur's confessor afterwards archbishop of reims and cardinal this admiration for fauchelevent became widespread for it made its way to rome we have seen a note addressed by the then reigning pope leo xii to one of his relatives a monsignor in the nuncio's establishment in paris and bearing like himself the name of della genga it contained these lines it appears that there is in a convent in paris an excellent gardener who is also a holy man named fauvent nothing of this triumph reached fauchelevent in his hut he went on grafting weeding and covering up his melon beds without in the least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity neither did he suspect his glory any more than a durham or surrey bull whose portrait is published,LM
2037,in the london illustrated news with this inscription bull which carried off the prize at the cattle show ix cloistered cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent it was quite natural that cosette should think herself jean valjean's daughter moreover as she knew nothing she could say nothing and then she would not have said anything in any case as we have just observed nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness cosette had suffered so much that she feared everything even to speak or to breathe a single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her she had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with jean valjean she speedily became accustomed to the convent only she regretted catherine but she dared not say so once however she did say to jean valjean father if i had known i would have brought her away with me cosette had been obliged on becoming a scholar in the convent to don the garb of the pupils of the house jean valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside this was the same mourning suit which he had made,LM
2038,her put on when she had quitted the thenardiers inn it was not very threadbare even now jean valjean locked up these garments plus the stockings and the shoes with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound in a little valise which he found means of procuring he set this valise on a chair near his bed and he always carried the key about his person father cosette asked him one day what is there in that box which smells so good father fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action in addition to the glory which we just mentioned and of which he knew nothing in the first place it made him happy next he had much less work since it was shared lastly as he was very fond of snuff he found the presence of m madeleine an advantage in that he used three times as much as he had done previously and that in an infinitely more luxurious manner seeing that m madeleine paid for it the nuns did not adopt the name of ultime they called jean valjean the other fauvent if these holy women had possessed anything of javert's glance,LM
2039,they would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done outside in the behalf of the garden it was always the elder fauchelevent the old the infirm the lame man who went and never the other but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on god know not how to spy or whether they were by preference occupied in keeping watch on each other they paid no heed to this moreover it was well for jean valjean that he kept close and did not stir out javert watched the quarter for more than a month this convent was for jean valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs henceforth those four walls constituted his world he saw enough of the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity and cosette enough to remain happy a very sweet life began for him he inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden in company with fauchelevent this hovel built of old rubbish which was still in existence in was composed as the reader already knows of three chambers all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls the principal one had been given,LM
2040,up by force for jean valjean had opposed it in vain to m madeleine by father fauchelevent the walls of this chamber had for ornament in addition to the two nails whereon to hang the knee cap and the basket a royalist bank note of applied to the wall over the chimney piece and of which the following is an exact facsimile this specimen of vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by the preceding gardener an old chouan who had died in the convent and whose place fauchelevent had taken jean valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very useful he had formerly been a pruner of trees and he gladly found himself a gardener once more it will be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture he turned these to advantage almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted and wild he budded them and made them produce excellent fruit cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day as the sisters were melancholy and he was kind the child made comparisons and adored him at the appointed hour she flew to the hut when,LM
2041,she entered the lowly cabin she filled it with paradise jean valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded cosette the joy which we inspire has this charming property that far from growing meagre like all reflections it returns to us more radiant than ever at recreation hours jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest for cosette laughed now cosette's face had even undergone a change to a certain extent the gloom had disappeared from it a smile is the same as sunshine it banishes winter from the human countenance recreation over when cosette went into the house again jean valjean gazed at the windows of her class room and at night he rose to look at the windows of her dormitory god has his own ways moreover the convent contributed like cosette to uphold and complete the bishop's work in jean valjean it is certain that virtue adjoins pride on one side a bridge built by the devil exists there jean valjean had been unconsciously perhaps tolerably near that side and that bridge when providence cast his lot in the,LM
2042,convent of the petit picpus so long as he had compared himself only to the bishop he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in general and pride was beginning to spring up who knows he might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred the convent stopped him on that downward path this was the second place of captivity which he had seen in his youth in what had been for him the beginning of his life and later on quite recently again he had beheld another a frightful place a terrible place whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of justice and the crime of the law now after the galleys he saw the cloister and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys and that he now so to speak was a spectator of the cloister he confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe and slowly descended the endless spirals of revery he recalled his former companions how wretched they were they rose at dawn,LM
2043,and toiled until night hardly were they permitted to sleep they lay on camp beds where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches thick in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of the year they were clothed in frightful red blouses they were allowed as a great favor linen trousers in the hottest weather and a woollen carter's blouse on their backs when it was very cold they drank no wine and ate no meat except when they went on fatigue duty they lived nameless designated only by numbers and converted after a manner into ciphers themselves with downcast eyes with lowered voices with shorn heads beneath the cudgel and in disgrace then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes these beings also lived with shorn heads with downcast eyes with lowered voices not in disgrace but amid the scoffs of the world not with their backs bruised with the cudgel but with their shoulders lacerated with their discipline their names also had vanished from among men they no longer existed except under austere appellations they never ate meat and they never drank wine they often remained until evening without food,LM
2044,they were attired not in a red blouse but in a black shroud of woollen which was heavy in summer and thin in winter without the power to add or subtract anything from it without having even according to the season the resource of the linen garment or the woollen cloak and for six months in the year they wore serge chemises which gave them fever they dwelt not in rooms warmed only during rigorous cold but in cells where no fire was ever lighted they slept not on mattresses two inches thick but on straw and finally they were not even allowed their sleep every night after a day of toil they were obliged in the weariness of their first slumber at the moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm to rouse themselves to rise and to go and pray in an ice cold and gloomy chapel with their knees on the stones on certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve successive hours in a kneeling posture or prostrate with face upon the pavement and arms outstretched in the form of a cross the others were men these,LM

2171,but he has never deigned to notice me so you are going to travel together he in the imperial i in the coupe where does this diligence run to andelys then that is where marius is going unless like myself he should stop on the way i get down at vernon in order to take the branch coach for gaillon i know nothing of marius plan of travel marius what an ugly name what possessed them to name him marius while you at least are called theodule i would rather be called alfred said the officer listen theodule i am listening aunt pay attention i am paying attention you understand yes well marius absents himself eh eh he travels ah ah he spends the night out oh oh we should like to know what there is behind all this theodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze some petticoat or other and with that inward laugh which denotes certainty he added a lass that is evident exclaimed his aunt who thought she heard m gillenormand speaking and who felt her conviction become irresistible at that word fillette accentuated in almost the very same fashion by the granduncle and,LM
2172,the grandnephew she resumed do us a favor follow marius a little he does not know you it will be easy since a lass there is try to get a sight of her you must write us the tale it will amuse his grandfather theodule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying but he was much touched by the ten louis and he thought he saw a chance for a possible sequel he accepted the commission and said as you please aunt and he added in an aside to himself here i am a duenna mademoiselle gillenormand embraced him you are not the man to play such pranks theodule you obey discipline you are the slave of orders you are a man of scruples and duty and you would not quit your family to go and see a creature the lancer made the pleased grimace of cartouche when praised for his probity marius on the evening following this dialogue mounted the diligence without suspecting that he was watched as for the watcher the first thing he did was to fall asleep his slumber was complete and conscientious argus snored all night long at daybreak the conductor of the,LM
2173,diligence shouted vernon relay of vernon travellers for vernon and lieutenant theodule woke good he growled still half asleep this is where i get out then as his memory cleared by degrees the effect of waking he recalled his aunt the ten louis and the account which he had undertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of marius this set him to laughing perhaps he is no longer in the coach he thought as he rebuttoned the waistcoat of his undress uniform he may have stopped at poissy he may have stopped at triel if he did not get out at meulan he may have got out at mantes unless he got out at rolleboise or if he did not go on as far as pacy with the choice of turning to the left at evreus or to the right at laroche guyon run after him aunty what the devil am i to write to that good old soul at that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial made its appearance at the window of the coupe can that be marius said the lieutenant it was marius a little peasant girl all entangled with the horses,LM
2174,and the postilions at the end of the vehicle was offering flowers to the travellers give your ladies flowers she cried marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat basket come now said theodule leaping down from the coupe this piques my curiosity who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to she must be a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet i want to see her and no longer in pursuance of orders but from personal curiosity like dogs who hunt on their own account he set out to follow marius marius paid no attention to theodule elegant women descended from the diligence he did not glance at them he seemed to see nothing around him he is pretty deeply in love thought theodule marius directed his steps towards the church capital said theodule to himself rendezvous seasoned with a bit of mass are the best sort nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes over the good god's head on arriving at the church marius did not enter it but skirted the apse he disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse the rendezvous is appointed outside said theodule,LM
2175,let's have a look at the lass and he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which marius had turned on arriving there he halted in amazement marius with his forehead clasped in his hands was kneeling upon the grass on a grave he had strewn his bouquet there at the extremity of the grave on a little swelling which marked the head there stood a cross of black wood with this name in white letters colonel baron pontmercy marius sobs were audible the lass was a grave viii marble against granite it was hither that marius had come on the first occasion of his absenting himself from paris it was hither that he had come every time that m gillenormand had said he is sleeping out lieutenant theodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this unexpected encounter with a sepulchre he experienced a singular and disagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing and which was composed of respect for the tomb mingled with respect for the colonel he retreated leaving marius alone in the cemetery and there was discipline in this retreat death appeared to him with large epaulets and he almost made the,LM
2176,military salute to him not knowing what to write to his aunt he decided not to write at all and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by theodule as to the love affairs of marius if by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance the scene at vernon had not had an almost immediate counter shock at paris marius returned from vernon on the third day in the middle of the morning descended at his grandfather's door and wearied by the two nights spent in the diligence and feeling the need of repairing his loss of sleep by an hour at the swimming school he mounted rapidly to his chamber took merely time enough to throw off his travelling coat and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck and went off to the bath m gillenormand who had risen betimes like all old men in good health had heard his entrance and had made haste to climb as quickly as his old legs permitted the stairs to the upper story where marius lived in order to embrace him and to question him while so doing and to find,LM
2177,out where he had been but the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to ascend and when father gillenormand entered the attic marius was no longer there the bed had not been disturbed and on the bed lay outspread but not defiantly the great coat and the black ribbon i like this better said m gillenormand and a moment later he made his entrance into the salon where mademoiselle gillenormand was already seated busily embroidering her cart wheels the entrance was a triumphant one m gillenormand held in one hand the great coat and in the other the neck ribbon and exclaimed y we are about to penetrate the mystery we are going to learn the most minute details we are going to lay our finger on the debaucheries of our sly friend here we have the romance itself i have the portrait in fact a case of black shagreen resembling a medallion portrait was suspended from the ribbon the old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening it with that air of enjoyment rapture and wrath with which a poor hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which,LM
2178,is not for him pass under his very nose for this evidently is a portrait i know all about such things that is worn tenderly on the heart how stupid they are some abominable fright that will make us shudder probably young men have such bad taste nowadays let us see father said the old spinster the case opened by the pressure of a spring they found in it nothing but a carefully folded paper from the same to the same said m gillenormand bursting with laughter i know what it is a billet doux ah let us read it said the aunt and she put on her spectacles they unfolded the paper and read as follows for my son the emperor made me a baron on the battlefield of waterloo since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it that he will be worthy of it is a matter of course the feelings of father and daughter cannot be described they felt chilled as by the breath of a death's head they did not exchange a word only m gillenormand said in a low voice,LM
2179,and as though speaking to himself it is the slasher's handwriting the aunt examined the paper turned it about in all directions then put it back in its case at the same moment a little oblong packet enveloped in blue paper fell from one of the pockets of the great coat mademoiselle gillenormand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper it contained marius hundred cards she handed one of them to m gillenormand who read le baron marius pontmercy the old man rang the bell nicolette came m gillenormand took the ribbon the case and the coat flung them all on the floor in the middle of the room and said carry those duds away a full hour passed in the most profound silence the old man and the old spinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other and were thinking each on his own account the same things in all probability at the expiration of this hour aunt gillenormand said a pretty state of things a few moments later marius made his appearance he entered even before he had crossed the threshold he saw his grandfather holding one of his own cards in his hand and,LM
2180,on catching sight of him the latter exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was something crushing well well well well well so you are a baron now i present you my compliments what is the meaning of this marius reddened slightly and replied it means that i am the son of my father m gillenormand ceased to laugh and said harshly i am your father my father retorted marius with downcast eyes and a severe air was a humble and heroic man who served the republic and france gloriously who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made who lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century beneath grape shot and bullets in snow and mud by day beneath rain at night who captured two flags who received twenty wounds who died forgotten and abandoned and who never committed but one mistake which was to love too fondly two ingrates his country and myself this was more than m gillenormand could bear to hear at the word republic he rose or to speak more correctly he sprang to his feet every word that marius had just uttered produced on the visage,LM
2181,of the old royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand from a dull hue he had turned red from red purple and from purple flame colored marius he cried abominable child i do not know what your father was i do not wish to know i know nothing about that and i do not know him but what i do know is that there never was anything but scoundrels among those men they were all rascals assassins red caps thieves i say all i say all i know not one i say all do you hear me marius see here you are no more a baron than my slipper is they were all bandits in the service of robespierre all who served b u o naparte were brigands they were all traitors who betrayed betrayed betrayed their legitimate king all cowards who fled before the prussians and the english at waterloo that is what i do know whether monsieur your father comes in that category i do not know i am sorry for it so much the worse your humble servant in his turn it was marius who was the firebrand and,LM
2182,m gillenormand who was the bellows marius quivered in every limb he did not know what would happen next his brain was on fire he was the priest who beholds all his sacred wafers cast to the winds the fakir who beholds a passer by spit upon his idol it could not be that such things had been uttered in his presence what was he to do his father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence but by whom by his grandfather how was he to avenge the one without outraging the other it was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was equally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged on the one hand was a sacred grave on the other hoary locks he stood there for several moments staggering as though intoxicated with all this whirlwind dashing through his head then he raised his eyes gazed fixedly at his grandfather and cried in a voice of thunder down with the bourbons and that great hog of a louis xviii louis xviii had been dead for four years but it was all the same to him the old man who had,LM
2183,been crimson turned whiter than his hair he wheeled round towards a bust of m le duc de berry which stood on the chimney piece and made a profound bow with a sort of peculiar majesty then he paced twice slowly and in silence from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace traversing the whole length of the room and making the polished floor creak as though he had been a stone statue walking on his second turn he bent over his daughter who was watching this encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb and said to her with a smile that was almost calm a baron like this gentleman and a bourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof and drawing himself up all at once pallid trembling terrible with his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath he extended his arm towards marius and shouted to him be off marius left the house on the following day m gillenormand said to his daughter you will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood drinker and you will never mention his name to me having an immense,LM
2184,reserve fund of wrath to get rid of and not knowing what to do with it he continued to address his daughter as you instead of thou for the next three months marius on his side had gone forth in indignation there was one circumstance which it must be admitted aggravated his exasperation there are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic dramas they augment the grievances in such cases although in reality the wrongs are not increased by them while carrying marius duds precipitately to his chamber at his grandfather's command nicolette had inadvertently let fall probably on the attic staircase which was dark that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper penned by the colonel neither paper nor case could afterwards be found marius was convinced that monsieur gillenormand from that day forth he never alluded to him otherwise had flung his father's testament in the fire he knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written and consequently nothing was lost but the paper the writing that sacred relic all that was his very heart what had been done with it marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going,LM

2186,that period opinions traverse phases voltairian royalism a quaint variety had a no less singular sequel bonapartist liberalism other groups of minds were more serious in that direction they sounded principles they attached themselves to the right they grew enthusiastic for the absolute they caught glimpses of infinite realizations the absolute by its very rigidity urges spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space there is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams and there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future utopia to day flesh and blood to morrow these advanced opinions had a double foundation a beginning of mystery menaced the established order of things which was suspicious and underhand a sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree the second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in the mine the incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of coups d'etat there did not as yet exist in france any of those vast underlying organizations like the german tugendbund and italian carbonarism but here and there there were dark underminings which were in process of throwing off shoots the cougourde was being outlined at aix there existed,LM

2188,was close to the workingman the second to the students the assemblies of the friends of the a b c were usually held in a back room of the cafe musain this hall which was tolerably remote from the cafe with which it was connected by an extremely long corridor had two windows and an exit with a private stairway on the little rue des gres there they smoked and drank and gambled and laughed there they conversed in very loud tones about everything and in whispers of other things an old map of france under the republic was nailed to the wall a sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent the greater part of the friends of the a b c were students who were on cordial terms with the working classes here are the names of the principal ones they belong in a certain measure to history enjolras combeferre jean prouvaire feuilly courfeyrac bahorel lesgle or laigle joly grantaire these young men formed a sort of family through the bond of friendship all with the exception of laigle were from the south this was a remarkable group it vanished in the invisible depths which,LM

2251,and where a certain number of law books backed up and completed by several dilapidated volumes of romance passed as the library required by the regulations he had his letters addressed to courfeyrac's quarters when marius became a lawyer he informed his grandfather of the fact in a letter which was cold but full of submission and respect m gillenormand trembled as he took the letter read it tore it in four pieces and threw it into the waste basket two or three days later mademoiselle gillenormand heard her father who was alone in his room talking aloud to himself he always did this whenever he was greatly agitated she listened and the old man was saying if you were not a fool you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at the same time ii marius poor it is the same with wretchedness as with everything else it ends by becoming bearable it finally assumes a form and adjusts itself one vegetates that is to say one develops in a certain meagre fashion which is however sufficient for life this is the mode in which the existence of marius pontmercy was arranged he had passed,LM
2252,the worst straits the narrow pass was opening out a little in front of him by dint of toil perseverance courage and will he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year he had learned german and english thanks to courfeyrac who had put him in communication with his friend the publisher marius filled the modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing house he drew up prospectuses translated newspapers annotated editions compiled biographies etc net product year in and year out seven hundred francs he lived on it how not so badly we will explain marius occupied in the gorbeau house for an annual sum of thirty francs a den minus a fireplace called a cabinet which contained only the most indispensable articles of furniture this furniture belonged to him he gave three francs a month to the old principal tenant to come and sweep his hole and to bring him a little hot water every morning a fresh egg and a penny roll he breakfasted on this egg and roll his breakfast varied in cost from two to four sous according as eggs were dear or cheap at six o'clock,LM
2253,in the evening he descended the rue saint jacques to dine at rousseau's opposite basset's the stamp dealer's on the corner of the rue des mathurins he ate no soup he took a six sou plate of meat a half portion of vegetables for three sous and a three sou dessert for three sous he got as much bread as he wished as for wine he drank water when he paid at the desk where madam rousseau at that period still plump and rosy majestically presided he gave a sou to the waiter and madam rousseau gave him a smile then he went away for sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner this restaurant rousseau where so few bottles and so many water carafes were emptied was a calming potion rather than a restaurant it no longer exists the proprietor had a fine nickname he was called rousseau the aquatic thus breakfast four sous dinner sixteen sous his food cost him twenty sous a day which made three hundred and sixty five francs a year add the thirty francs for rent and the thirty six francs to the old woman plus a few trifling expenses for four hundred,LM

2256,with a sort of aureole the man to whom in his thoughts he owed his father's life that intrepid sergeant who had saved the colonel amid the bullets and the cannon balls of waterloo he never separated the memory of this man from the memory of his father and he associated them in his veneration it was a sort of worship in two steps with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one for thenardier what redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards thenardier was the idea of the distress into which he knew that thenardier had fallen and which had engulfed the latter marius had learned at montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate inn keeper since that time he had made unheard of efforts to find traces of him and to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in which thenardier had disappeared marius had beaten the whole country he had gone to chelles to bondy to gourney to nogent to lagny he had persisted for three years expending in these explorations the little money which he had laid by no one had been able to give him any news of thenardier he,LM

2258,dispose of me this was marius sweetest and most magnificent dream iii marius grown up at this epoch marius was twenty years of age it was three years since he had left his grandfather both parties had remained on the same terms without attempting to approach each other and without seeking to see each other besides what was the use of seeing each other marius was the brass vase while father gillenormand was the iron pot we admit that marius was mistaken as to his grandfather's heart he had imagined that m gillenormand had never loved him and that that crusty harsh and smiling old fellow who cursed shouted and stormed and brandished his cane cherished for him at the most only that affection which is at once slight and severe of the dotards of comedy marius was in error there are fathers who do not love their children there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson at bottom as we have said m gillenormand idolized marius he idolized him after his own fashion with an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on the ear but this child once gone he felt a black void in his heart he,LM
2259,would allow no one to mention the child to him and all the while secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed at first he hoped that this buonapartist this jacobin this terrorist this septembrist would return but the weeks passed by years passed to m gillenormand's great despair the blood drinker did not make his appearance i could not do otherwise than turn him out said the grandfather to himself and he asked himself if the thing were to do over again would i do it his pride instantly answered yes but his aged head which he shook in silence replied sadly no he had his hours of depression he missed marius old men need affection as they need the sun it is warmth strong as his nature was the absence of marius had wrought some change in him nothing in the world could have induced him to take a step towards that rogue but he suffered he never inquired about him but he thought of him incessantly he lived in the marais in a more and more retired manner he was still merry and violent as of old but his merriment had a convulsive harshness and his violences,LM
2260,always terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy dejection he sometimes said oh if he only would return what a good box on the ear i would give him as for his aunt she thought too little to love much marius was no longer for her much more than a vague black form and she eventually came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the paroquet which she probably had what augmented father gillenormand's secret suffering was that he locked it all up within his breast and did not allow its existence to be divined his sorrow was like those recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke it sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of marius and asked him what is your grandson doing what has become of him the old bourgeois replied with a sigh that he was a sad case and giving a fillip to his cuff if he wished to appear gay monsieur le baron de pontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other while the old man regretted marius applauded himself as is the case with all good hearted people misfortune had eradicated his bitterness he,LM
2261,only thought of m gillenormand in an amiable light but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father this was the mitigated translation of his first indignation moreover he was happy at having suffered and at suffering still it was for his father's sake the hardness of his life satisfied and pleased him he said to himself with a sort of joy that it was certainly the least he could do that it was an expiation that had it not been for that he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father and such a father that it would not have been just that his father should have all the suffering and he none of it and that in any case what were his toils and his destitution compared with the colonel's heroic life that in short the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him was to be brave in the face of indigence as the other had been valiant before the enemy and that that was no doubt what the colonel had meant,LM
2262,to imply by the words he will be worthy of it words which marius continued to wear not on his breast since the colonel's writing had disappeared but in his heart and then on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors he had been only a child now he was a man he felt it misery we repeat had been good for him poverty in youth when it succeeds has this magnificent property about it that it turns the whole will towards effort and the whole soul towards aspiration poverty instantly lays material life bare and renders it hideous hence inexpressible bounds towards the ideal life the wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions horse races hunting dogs tobacco gaming good repasts and all the rest of it occupations for the baser side of the soul at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides the poor young man wins his bread with difficulty he eats when he has eaten he has nothing more but meditation he goes to the spectacles which god furnishes gratis he gazes at the sky space the stars flowers children the humanity among which he is suffering,LM
2263,the creation amid which he beams he gazes so much on humanity that he perceives its soul he gazes upon creation to such an extent that he beholds god he dreams he feels himself great he dreams on and feels himself tender from the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the compassion of the man who meditates an admirable sentiment breaks forth in him forgetfulness of self and pity for all as he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature offers gives and lavishes to souls which stand open and refuses to souls that are closed he comes to pity he the millionnaire of the mind the millionnaire of money all hatred departs from his heart in proportion as light penetrates his spirit and is he unhappy no the misery of a young man is never miserable the first young lad who comes to hand however poor he may be with his strength his health his rapid walk his brilliant eyes his warmly circulating blood his black hair his red lips his white teeth his pure breath will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor and then every morning he sets himself afresh to the task,LM
2264,of earning his bread and while his hands earn his bread his dorsal column gains pride his brain gathers ideas his task finished he returns to ineffable ecstasies to contemplation to joys he beholds his feet set in afflictions in obstacles on the pavement in the nettles sometimes in the mire his head in the light he is firm serene gentle peaceful attentive serious content with little kindly and he thanks god for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich man lacks work which makes him free and thought which makes him dignified this is what had happened with marius to tell the truth he inclined a little too much to the side of contemplation from the day when he had succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty he had stopped thinking it good to be poor and retrenching time from his work to give to thought that is to say he sometimes passed entire days in meditation absorbed engulfed like a visionary in the mute voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance he had thus propounded the problem of his life to toil as little as possible at material labor in,LM
2265,order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable in other words to bestow a few hours on real life and to cast the rest to the infinite as he believed that he lacked nothing he did not perceive that contemplation thus understood ends by becoming one of the forms of idleness that he was contenting himself with conquering the first necessities of life and that he was resting from his labors too soon it was evident that for this energetic and enthusiastic nature this could only be a transitory state and that at the first shock against the inevitable complications of destiny marius would awaken in the meantime although he was a lawyer and whatever father gillenormand thought about the matter he was not practising he was not even pettifogging meditation had turned him aside from pleading to haunt attorneys to follow the court to hunt up cases what a bore why should he do it he saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his livelihood the obscure and ill paid publishing establishment had come to mean for him a sure source of work which did not involve too much labor as we,LM

2292,the luxembourg the one which skirts the parapet of the pepiniere a man and a very young girl who were almost always seated side by side on the same bench at the most solitary end of the alley on the rue de l'ouest side every time that that chance which meddles with the strolls of persons whose gaze is turned inwards led marius to that walk and it was nearly every day he found this couple there the man appeared to be about sixty years of age he seemed sad and serious his whole person presented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military men who have retired from the service if he had worn a decoration marius would have said he is an ex officer he had a kindly but unapproachable air and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one he wore blue trousers a blue frock coat and a broad brimmed hat which always appeared to be new a black cravat a quaker shirt that is to say it was dazzlingly white but of coarse linen a grisette who passed near him one day said here's a very tidy widower his hair was,LM
2293,very white the first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seated herself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted she was a sort of child thirteen or fourteen years of age so thin as to be almost homely awkward insignificant and with a possible promise of handsome eyes only they were always raised with a sort of displeasing assurance her dress was both aged and childish like the dress of the scholars in a convent it consisted of a badly cut gown of black merino they had the air of being father and daughter marius scanned this old man who was not yet aged and this little girl who was not yet a person for a few days and thereafter paid no attention to them they on their side did not appear even to see him they conversed together with a peaceful and indifferent air the girl chattered incessantly and merrily the old man talked but little and at times he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk he invariably found them there this is the way things went marius liked,LM
2294,to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from their bench he walked the whole length of the alley passed in front of them then returned to the extremity whence he had come and began again this he did five or six times in the course of his promenade and the promenade was taken five or six times a week without its having occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting that personage and that young girl although they appeared and perhaps because they appeared to shun all glances had naturally caused some attention on the part of the five or six students who strolled along the pepiniere from time to time the studious after their lectures the others after their game of billiards courfeyrac who was among the last had observed them several times but finding the girl homely he had speedily and carefully kept out of the way he had fled discharging at them a sobriquet like a parthian dart impressed solely with the child's gown and the old man's hair he had dubbed the daughter mademoiselle lanoire and the father monsieur leblanc so that as no one knew them under any,LM
2295,other title this nickname became a law in the default of any other name the students said ah monsieur leblanc is on his bench and marius like the rest had found it convenient to call this unknown gentleman monsieur leblanc we shall follow their example and we shall say m leblanc in order to facilitate this tale so marius saw them nearly every day at the same hour during the first year he found the man to his taste but the girl insipid ii lux facta est during the second year precisely at the point in this history which the reader has now reached it chanced that this habit of the luxembourg was interrupted without marius himself being quite aware why and nearly six months elapsed during which he did not set foot in the alley one day at last he returned thither once more it was a serene summer morning and marius was in joyous mood as one is when the weather is fine it seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the birds that he was listening to and all the bits of blue sky of which he caught glimpses through the,LM
2296,leaves of the trees he went straight to his alley and when he reached the end of it he perceived still on the same bench that well known couple only when he approached it certainly was the same man but it seemed to him that it was no longer the same girl the person whom he now beheld was a tall and beautiful creature possessed of all the most charming lines of a woman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all the most ingenuous graces of the child a pure and fugitive moment which can be expressed only by these two words fifteen years she had wonderful brown hair shaded with threads of gold a brow that seemed made of marble cheeks that seemed made of rose leaf a pale flush an agitated whiteness an exquisite mouth whence smiles darted like sunbeams and words like music a head such as raphael would have given to mary set upon a neck that jean goujon would have attributed to a venus and in order that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching face her nose was not handsome it was pretty neither straight nor curved neither italian nor,LM
2297,greek it was the parisian nose that is to say spiritual delicate irregular pure which drives painters to despair and charms poets when marius passed near her he could not see her eyes which were constantly lowered he saw only her long chestnut lashes permeated with shadow and modesty this did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened to what the white haired old man was saying to her and nothing could be more fascinating than that fresh smile combined with those drooping eyes for a moment marius thought that she was another daughter of the same man a sister of the former no doubt but when the invariable habit of his stroll brought him for the second time near the bench and he had examined her attentively he recognized her as the same in six months the little girl had become a young maiden that was all nothing is more frequent than this phenomenon there is a moment when girls blossom out in the twinkling of an eye and become roses all at once one left them children but yesterday today one finds them disquieting to the feelings this child had not only grown she had,LM
2298,become idealized as three days in april suffice to cover certain trees with flowers six months had sufficed to clothe her with beauty her april had arrived one sometimes sees people who poor and mean seem to wake up pass suddenly from indigence to luxury indulge in expenditures of all sorts and become dazzling prodigal magnificent all of a sudden that is the result of having pocketed an income a note fell due yesterday the young girl had received her quarterly income and then she was no longer the school girl with her felt hat her merino gown her scholar's shoes and red hands taste had come to her with beauty she was a well dressed person clad with a sort of rich and simple elegance and without affectation she wore a dress of black damask a cape of the same material and a bonnet of white crape her white gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with the carved chinese ivory handle of a parasol and her silken shoe outlined the smallness of her foot when one passed near her her whole toilette exhaled a youthful and penetrating perfume as for the man he was the same,LM
2299,as usual the second time that marius approached her the young girl raised her eyelids her eyes were of a deep celestial blue but in that veiled azure there was as yet nothing but the glance of a child she looked at marius indifferently as she would have stared at the brat running beneath the sycamores or the marble vase which cast a shadow on the bench and marius on his side continued his promenade and thought about something else he passed near the bench where the young girl sat five or six times but without even turning his eyes in her direction on the following days he returned as was his wont to the luxembourg as usual he found there the father and daughter but he paid no further attention to them he thought no more about the girl now that she was beautiful than he had when she was homely he passed very near the bench where she sat because such was his habit iii effect of the spring one day the air was warm the luxembourg was inundated with light and shade the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that morning the,LM
2300,sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths of the chestnut trees marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature he was not thinking of anything he simply lived and breathed he passed near the bench the young girl raised her eyes to him the two glances met what was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion marius could not have told there was nothing and there was everything it was a strange flash she dropped her eyes and he pursued his way what he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple eye of a child it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened then abruptly closed again there comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner woe to him who chances to be there that first gaze of a soul which does not as yet know itself is like the dawn in the sky it is the awakening of something radiant and strange nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that unexpected gleam which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable shadows and which is composed of all the innocence of the present and,LM
2301,of all the passion of the future it is a sort of undecided tenderness which reveals itself by chance and which waits it is a snare which the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself and in which she captures hearts without either wishing or knowing it it is a virgin looking like a woman it is rare that a profound revery does not spring from that glance where it falls all purities and all candors meet in that celestial and fatal gleam which more than all the best planned tender glances of coquettes possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming in the depths of the soul of that sombre flower impregnated with perfume and with poison which is called love that evening on his return to his garret marius cast his eyes over his garments and perceived for the first time that he had been so slovenly indecorous and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in the luxembourg with his every day clothes that is to say with a hat battered near the band coarse carter's boots black trousers which showed white at the knees and a black coat which was pale at the elbows iv,LM
2302,beginning of a great malady on the following day at the accustomed hour marius drew from his wardrobe his new coat his new trousers his new hat and his new boots he clothed himself in this complete panoply put on his gloves a tremendous luxury and set off for the luxembourg on the way thither he encountered courfeyrac and pretended not to see him courfeyrac on his return home said to his friends i have just met marius new hat and new coat with marius inside them he was going to pass an examination no doubt he looked utterly stupid on arriving at the luxembourg marius made the tour of the fountain basin and stared at the swans then he remained for a long time in contemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould and one of whose hips was missing near the basin there was a bourgeois forty years of age with a prominent stomach who was holding by the hand a little urchin of five and saying to him shun excess my son keep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy marius listened to this bourgeois then he made the circuit of the,LM
2303,basin once more at last he directed his course towards his alley slowly and as if with regret one would have said that he was both forced to go there and withheld from doing so he did not perceive it himself and thought that he was doing as he always did on turning into the walk he saw m leblanc and the young girl at the other end on their bench he buttoned his coat up to the very top pulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles examined with a certain complaisance the lustrous gleams of his trousers and marched on the bench this march savored of an attack and certainly of a desire for conquest so i say that he marched on the bench as i should say hannibal marched on rome however all his movements were purely mechanical and he had interrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors at that moment he was thinking that the manuel du baccalaureat was a stupid book and that it must have been drawn up by rare idiots to allow of three tragedies of racine and only one comedy of moliere being,LM
2304,analyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind there was a piercing whistling going on in his ears as he approached the bench he held fast to the folds in his coat and fixed his eyes on the young girl it seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a vague blue light in proportion as he drew near his pace slackened more and more on arriving at some little distance from the bench and long before he had reached the end of the walk he halted and could not explain to himself why he retraced his steps he did not even say to himself that he would not go as far as the end it was only with difficulty that the young girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine appearance in his new clothes nevertheless he held himself very erect in case any one should be looking at him from behind he attained the opposite end then came back and this time he approached a little nearer to the bench he even got to within three intervals of trees but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further,LM
2305,and he hesitated he thought he saw the young girl's face bending towards him but he exerted a manly and violent effort subdued his hesitation and walked straight ahead a few seconds later he rushed in front of the bench erect and firm reddening to the very ears without daring to cast a glance either to the right or to the left with his hand thrust into his coat like a statesman at the moment when he passed under the cannon of the place he felt his heart beat wildly as on the preceding day she wore her damask gown and her crape bonnet he heard an ineffable voice which must have been her voice she was talking tranquilly she was very pretty he felt it although he made no attempt to see her she could not however he thought help feeling esteem and consideration for me if she only knew that i am the veritable author of the dissertation on marcos obregon de la ronde which m francois de neufchateau put as though it were his own at the head of his edition of gil blas he went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the walk,LM
2306,which was very near then turned on his heel and passed once more in front of the lovely girl this time he was very pale moreover all his emotions were disagreeable as he went further from the bench and the young girl and while his back was turned to her he fancied that she was gazing after him and that made him stumble he did not attempt to approach the bench again he halted near the middle of the walk and there a thing which he never did he sat down and reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit that after all it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and black gown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers and his new coat at the expiration of a quarter of an hour he rose as though he were on the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was surrounded by an aureole but he remained standing there motionless for the first time in fifteen months he said to himself that that gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter had on his side noticed him and probably considered his,LM
2307,assiduity singular for the first time also he was conscious of some irreverence in designating that stranger even in his secret thoughts by the sobriquet of m le blanc he stood thus for several minutes with drooping head tracing figures in the sand with the cane which he held in his hand then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench to m leblanc and his daughter and went home that day he forgot to dine at eight o'clock in the evening he perceived this fact and as it was too late to go down to the rue saint jacques he said never mind and ate a bit of bread he did not go to bed until he had brushed his coat and folded it up with great care v divrs claps of thunder fall on ma'am bougon on the following day ma'am bougon as courfeyrac styled the old portress principal tenant housekeeper of the gorbeau hovel ma'am bougon whose name was in reality madame burgon as we have found out but this iconoclast courfeyrac respected nothing ma'am bougon observed with stupefaction that m marius was going out again in his new coat he went to the luxembourg,LM

2312,he followed her with his eyes until she disappeared then he started up and walked about the luxembourg garden like a madman it is possible that at times he laughed to himself and talked aloud he was so dreamy when he came near the children's nurses that each one of them thought him in love with her he quitted the luxembourg hoping to find her again in the street he encountered courfeyrac under the arcades of the odeon and said to him come and dine with me they went off to rousseau's and spent six francs marius ate like an ogre he gave the waiter six sous at dessert he said to courfeyrac have you read the paper what a fine discourse audry de puyraveau delivered he was desperately in love after dinner he said to courfeyrac i will treat you to the play they went to the porte sainte martin to see frederick in l'auberge des adrets marius was enormously amused at the same time he had a redoubled attack of shyness on emerging from the theatre he refused to look at the garter of a modiste who was stepping across a gutter and courfeyrac who said i should,LM

2316,as little as possible by the old gentleman sometimes he remained motionless by the half hour together in the shade of a leonidas or a spartacus holding in his hand a book above which his eyes gently raised sought the beautiful girl and she on her side turned her charming profile towards him with a vague smile while conversing in the most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white haired man she bent upon marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye ancient and time honored manoeuvre which eve understood from the very first day of the world and which every woman understands from the very first day of her life her mouth replied to one and her glance replied to another it must be supposed that m leblanc finally noticed something for often when marius arrived he rose and began to walk about he had abandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the gladiator near the other end of the walk as though with the object of seeing whether marius would pursue them thither marius did not understand and committed this error the father began to grow inexact and no longer,LM

2318,and at night laid it beneath his lips that he might fall asleep on it i feel that her whole soul lies within it he exclaimed this handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman who had simply let it fall from his pocket in the days which followed the finding of this treasure he only displayed himself at the luxembourg in the act of kissing the handkerchief and laying it on his heart the beautiful child understood nothing of all this and signified it to him by imperceptible signs o modesty said marius viii the veterans themselves can be happy since we have pronounced the word modesty and since we conceal nothing we ought to say that once nevertheless in spite of his ecstasies his ursule caused him very serious grief it was on one of the days when she persuaded m leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk a brisk may breeze was blowing which swayed the crests of the plaintain trees the father and daughter arm in arm had just passed marius bench marius had risen to his feet behind them and was following them with his eyes as was fitting in the desperate situation of,LM
